His wife works as a budget manager for Academic Affairs for Georgia Southern University in Stateboro.As stated in the report, they were returning from a popular Christmas lights display ar ound 10pm. It was a few days before Christmas.They were driving south on Lakeview Road when the sasquatch crossed the road less than 50 feet from their vehicle from left to right. It was fully lit by the headlights of the vehicle. They both saw it. The fur color was dark brown. It was slightly hunched over as it walked across the road. It was \"bulky\" and they estimate it stood 7-8 feet tall.They were not driving fast along Lakeview Road because they have seen deer at night on this road. They were afraid of hitting a deer.The location is two miles from the swampy Ogeechee River.Here is the Google Maps pin for the exact location where the sasquatch was standing right before it crossed the road:https://goo.gl/maps/tTaerAGuqkqgGLA99..",
