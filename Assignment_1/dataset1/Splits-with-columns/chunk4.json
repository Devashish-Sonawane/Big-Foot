            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, Chase Collins, by phone. He now lives in Arizona and works as a night auditor at a local resort. He lived in Oklahoma City for a year or so and would walk along the same trail once or twice per week. He would never walk as far as he did on this occasion because beyond a certain point the road was not maintained and was very overgrown.As stated in his report he estimates his distance was 250 feet or so from the figure. He watched it for 10-15 seconds before reaching for his phone to take photos. The figure was already moving into thicker brush by the time he got his phone in position to take photos. He was very certain that it was covered with dark fur that had a reddish-brown tinge on the edges. The fur was hanging down from its arms as it was parting the reeds to move back into the woods away from the river bank.The location of the witness when he spotted the figure:35.5394882, -97.6781140The approximate location of the figure:35.5399187, -97.6790202The BFRO shot two episodes of Finding Bigfoot in Oklahoma. One segment of one episode was the investigation of a credible sighting by two kayakers within this same refuge. There were other second hand stories as well. This swampy refuge is crawling with wildlife. The only hunting allowed is for waterfowl, and only during that season. No camping allowed and there\u0092s only a few trails, and only on the perimeter.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE (7/29/21)>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Hello BFRO,My name is Ryan White and I\u0092m writing you this email in response to a specific Bigfoot report on your website \u0093Report #69006 Hiker\u0092s dusk sighting in Stinchcomb Wildlife Refuge.\u0094 I recently became aware of this Bigfoot sighting report which, according to your records, occurred on Monday, April 15th, 2019. I read the report for the 1st time on July 28th, 2021.I\u0092m a part of a Bigfoot Group called the North Canadian River Project which is a group based out of the El Reno & the OKC area. We were planning to go kayaking on the North Canadian River on Saturday, April 13th, 2019 on a group investigation. Due to weather we made the decision to not go kayaking that day. A small group of us (3) to be exact (Ryan White, Evans Bailey, & Jody Blaylock), still wanted to investigate on this date despite the bad weather. Our backup plan was to meet at the parking area of the Stinchcomb Wildlife Refuge and hike trails and the perimeter road looking for signs of any Sasquatch type activity. Once again, our hike occurred 2 days before your Sighting Report on Monday, April 15th, 2019.You may be interested to know that we found a line of tracks which clearly showed right and left prints that were anywhere from a quarter of a mile to a half mile long.  The. Tracks were a consistent 10.5 inches. We documented our hike with some video footage of the trackway. The video footage can be found on a site called bitchute.com and I\u0092ll provide the exact link of the video at the end of this message. Points of interest in the video:(Trackway Segment 1) 9:37 - 15:03(Trackway Segment 2) 16:54 - 19:42(Measurement of Track) @ 19:00(Well House Reference) @ 17:47Your Eyewitness Report calls it a \u0093communication building\u0094.(Power line Cut Footage) @ 19:42Your Sighting Report happened very close to the Power Line Cut towards the North section of the park. Our trackway we found may or not be related to the creature seen in your sighting report. Our group was interested in getting your response to the tracks we discovered. Thank you for your time and reviewing our findings.

I just hanging out by a swamp clearing a trail and had a weird feeling where something was watching me. My back was turned to the swamp and I heard a small splash coming across the swamp and didn't really think nothing of it. About thirty seconds later I heard another one and that one caught my attention but I didn't see it. It was bigger and it was in the middle of the swamp. So I dialed my buddy and as he picked up the phone, a rock about the size of a football, if not bigger was thrown about three quarters across the swamp and I saw this one hit the water.",

He was hanging out by a swamp clearing a trail and had a weird feeling that something was watching him. His back was turned to the swamp and he heard a small splashing sound coming from across the swamp and he didn't really think nothing of it .Maybe thirty seconds later he heard another splash sound, and that one caught his attention, but still didn't see what it was. This splash sound sounded bigger, heavier and it landed in the middle of the swamp. He looked out and saw the rock in the air. Something threw it about three quarters (75ft) across the swamp, and he saw this one hit the water. The water was shallow so he went out the following day and picked up the rock and brought it to where it was originally thrown from, and he found that spot, took some photos of that area as well. He did go around to the spot where he thinks the rock was thrown from, and found multiple tracks and a track way. He did send photos and they were great but lacked a size comparison to gauge length etc. Here are two taken of the possible tracks:",
