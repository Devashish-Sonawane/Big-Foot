            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness over the phone. He and his wife do not live in the local area. While talking with the witness, we were able to determine where he was, and where the vocalizations probably originated from. I also discovered that the witness is in law-enforcement, and can be assumed to be an expert observer.It is difficult to say exactly which direction the vocalizations came from due to the terrain and trees at this location. Sounds can reflect off of terrain and trees, and appear to come from a direction opposite where they actually originated from. The witness was on Lake Saint Claire and where he was standing when he made his recording, he was facing north. His impression was that the sounds came from the west. There is a large tract of forest to the west about .3 miles, and also to the east about the same distance. To the east is the Nisqually Indian Reservation and Joint Base Lewis-McCord (JBLM), which is an enormous area of 84,000 acres and is 95% forest. The area to the west is about 180 acres, but has forested pathways connecting back to the JBLM side. Either location could hold sasquatches.The witness sent me the video file, which contains the audio, as well as information to help locate his position. Even though one can hear a jet-ski start up, the vocalization can be heard to start at the same time and continue for some seconds after. The witness described the vocalization as a cross between a canine and a howler monkey with a base tone that lasted quite long and was very loud. They heard the vocalization three times. Later the witness was able to send just the audio from the recording. I loaded this file into Sonic Visualizer, applied a spectrograph layer, and was able to see visually what the vocalization looked like. This vocalization contained three harmonics at 380, 680, and 980 Hz. The sounds were essentially the same as other vocalizations of this type which are most likely from sasquatch. I call this the \u0093long howl\u0094.That sasquatches live in this area are expected. There are many reports from JBLM and the surrounding countryside. In this area, they are common, although elusive. It is my opinion that what these two witnesses heard was a sasquatch.",

            "Observed": "It was the second weekend in September 2018, my father and I went for a drive up Sumas mountain like we've done many times before when we decided to stop at this clear cut over looking the valley. It was about 9pm in the evening and we were scanning the clear cut with our flashlights when we first saw the eyeshine in the distance approximately 150 to 200yards. We saw 3 pairs of eye shine and at different heights thinking at first we are seeing  a mother bear and cubs but after shining our flashlights in their direction the larger creature charged up the hill along the tree line grunting and hollering then stopped and waited for the other 2.  Thats when we got our flashlights on it and it was large and brown. Then the larger one turned into the woods heading towards us breaking down branches and saplings then it just stopped and everything went silent.  As my dad and I sat there the other 2 sat on the edge of the tree line just watching us they walked around a bit but every time we made a noise they would stop what they were doing and just watched us.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the son and dad by phone.They go to this area often and that evening they observed  with their flashlights three different sized figures. It was difficult for them to estimate heights, but the medium size figure was one head length shorter than the large one and the smallest was half that height. They got the impression the large one was mad when it charged up the hill as there was screaming with the grunting and hollering. It went up a steep hill very fast. It seemed to the son that it moved fifty yards in just a couple seconds. I asked what they thought the figures were doing all this time and the witnesses could only guess they were trying to hide, yet would move around some. The medium figure would come in and out of the tree line. The dad said it would step behind a tree but seemed to be watching the smaller one. The dad said they saw the smaller one pop its head up from behind a stump or log three times. The son described the eye shine as orange and the dad said yellow-orange. The dad said they were not sure exactly what they were seeing until the large one came back out of the tree line. This is when both had their flashlights on it. Both witnesses saw it walk upright on two legs, arm swing, arm below the hip. It was brown, big and powerful, maybe 700 pounds. It was too far to see details such as hair length, etc. The dad said he saw it walk for at least twenty yards, the son said twenty to forty yards. They did not detect any foul odor. As mentioned, the son went back the next day. He went to the log they saw the large figure step over. The son is six feet, one inch tall and could not step over the log, only slide over it. The son had an Energizer 1300 lumens flashlight and his dad an 1100 lumens. The flashlights were set on spotlight or narrow beam. There are many models of flashlights but I found one Energizer 1300 lumens that listed beam distance of 230 meters = 251 yards. ",
