I have seen and heard weird things there and me and my nephew seen a big foot walking towards us and my friend seen them recently and got pictures on his phone of two or maybe three of them the people who live their have seen them or heard them I believe that if you go there for not just one day and night it will take you about four to five days before you might see one if you try looking for them you wont see them but if you just camp out and hang out for awhile I am pretty sure that something will get your attention there is all kinds of signs there.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness on the phone. He is 52 years old, and a life-long outdoorsman. He lives in a rural area about 20 miles south of Tacoma. While the narrative of his report reads more like just a recommendation of a good place to go, talking to him on the phone revealed that he has experienced much more than what is written. In 1998, while hunting with a relative near Cispus Center and Yellowjacket Creek, he had an encounter at a 25 feet distance. They were riding bikes when his relative caught his shoelace in the bike sprocket. They stopped in the trail to untangle the shoe-lace. While they were working to free the shoelace, a 6 \u00bd foot tall sasquatch came walking up the trail. It realized that there were people there when it got within 25 feet. It then side-stepped behind a large maple tree, and began to peek out from one side, and then the other side. This close sighting so frightened the two hunters that they left as fast as they could. I asked him to describe the sasquatch. The color was all black. He said that it blended-in so well that looked like a fuzzy shadow. It was barrel chested. Very heavy looking. It had a thick neck, and a big head. It was close enough to see the whites of its eyes. A couple of years ago, while fly-fishing on Yellowjacket Creek, not far from the previous sighting, two sasquatch came down to the creek to drink. He said they appeared to be a male and female. The male squatted-down and cupped water in its hands to drink. The other one stayed back. It was not as big. The big one was 150 feet away. It had light brown hair, and a gray-white beard. The other one was the same color. He was so frightened that he dropped his fly-rod and tackle box and ran away. He never went back. He indicated that he has no desire to go back to this area in the future.Another time, while camping in the same area near Yellowjacket Creek, something came by and emptied his cooler all in a pile on the ground. All that was missing was a jug of milk. There was no mess or tooth marks, so it wasn\u0092t a bear or raccoon.On his property on 5 wooded acres south of Tacoma, he said that he hears things that are not coyote or anything else he recognizes. On occasion, he smells \u0093That sasquatch smell\u0094. Once, he saw a large brown bi-pedal creature walk by in his woods. Apples are taken from the top of his tree, but the ones lower down are left. This behavior has been reported in other places.My wife and I went out to the Yellowjacket Creek area to look around. The witness did not accompany us there, so we were guessing where exactly the above events took place. We hiked the area, but saw nothing, which is to be expected since much time has passed since the events. There are several other reports from this area, including Report #21473.I believe that this person saw one or more sasquatches on two occasions. The sightings were in daylight and were unmistakable. This witness has lived his whole life in the area, and is an experienced outdoorsman who would unlikely mistake some other animal for a sasquatch. With respect to the photos that the witness mentioned. They were taken by his friend at a different time and place, and so have nothing to do with this report. However, I attempted to obtain those pictures, but was unsuccessful.",
