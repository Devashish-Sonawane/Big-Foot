            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone after he had moved with his family to Wisconsin. What he told me was consistent with his written report. He emphasized that the knock was very loud. In addition, he mentioned that on an earlier hike, he had heard what sounded like bi-pedal foot steps in the forest near him but could not see anything.Analyzing this photo, I zoomed in on the possible figure just off the path until the figure became too pixelated to determine what it was. The shape was consistent with a crouching figure, but there is little in the photo to determine size. The light colored \u0093face\u0094 was unusual in my experience if it was a living creature.I have walked this path on multiple occasions due to other reported encounters. Wildlife is abundant. The path borders the east side of a small river that joins two large reservoirs. The west side of the river is, for the most part, an uninhabited forest. The witness was very consistent and sincere in his testimony. I believe that he may have had an encounter but his photo is not of sufficient clarity to determine if it recorded a living creature. But it does show you what the path looks like. ",

            "Observed": "While driving to work some thing large ran behind my mini van as I slowed and made a left hand turn. It looked like a silhouette of a very large man. I was shocked but didn't stop until I was about 1/2 Mile away. The sun was just about to come up. It was about 6:00 am. Kind of rattled all day thinking back on it frequently because it made no sense. It was cool, drizzling, dark and in a very rural area. People don't run around the roads anytime of day much less 6am.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness (Jan) over the phone.  She was driving to work early in the morning and she came to a complete stop at a four way intersection.  As she turned left she saw something cross behind her vehicle going from the driver\u0092s side to the passenger side.  She drives a mini-van and the top of the back window is about 5 feet off the ground.  She said the shoulders were at or slightly above the top of the window.   Her boyfriend is a bit over 6 feet tall and the top of his head is slightly above the top of the van.  She said it seemed really athletic, like a big linebacker.  As it crossed it did not fully cover the entire back window as there were little slivers of light on either side.  She feels as if it paused briefly or turned somewhat to look in the window as it went by.  She saw it just after making the turn, she had a split second where she was neither on the gas, nor the brake and then she drove off.  She felt very rattled and did not slow down or go back.  The road is pretty open so it is quite likely that the creature saw her coming and had squatted down in the ditch to hide before she got there.   Because of the time of day she could see little more than a silhouette as it passed by.  There is a lot of cover, water and wild animals in the area including bobcats, hogs, deer etc.  It is another area in the state where people don\u0092t walk around on other people\u0092s land at night for fear of getting shot. She has thought about the incident a lot and each day as she drives that area she is watching more closely",
