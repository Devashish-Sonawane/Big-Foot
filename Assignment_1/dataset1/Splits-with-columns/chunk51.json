            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness delivers papers every Saturday morning. She is on the road from about 2:00 AM until she finishes sometime after daylight. She travels from Morton all the way to Packwood. She was on Washington Highway 12, traveling west-bound, near the east end of Silverbrook Road. She had the window rolled-down and she was putting a paper in the box when she heard two vocalizations. The first one came from about 50 yards away. It was described as a high pitched \u0093Whooo-oop\u0094, which gave her the impression that is was a \u0093Where are you?\u0094. The second vocalization came from a different direction and was further away. The tone of this one was deeper and louder, which she described as a whoop-growl. She felt that the first one was a female and the second was a male.She noticed that the cows were all bunched-up by the nearest house. Usually they are spread-out in the pasture. She said that it was eerily quiet and that she usually can hear night birds and other noises. This time, it was silent. Further, her small dogs dove to the floor-boards to hide. She said that she felt an overwhelming fear that has stayed with her to this day.She went back after daylight, and found a trail coming out of the woods. She said that the vocalizations came from the area between Highway 12 and Silverbrook road.There was another report from very close to this area, and that sasquatch, which was clearly seen by the whole family, came from the mountains to the north side of Silverbrook road. This report was briefly published, and then taken down due to people figuring out where the actual residence was and who they were, and then trespassing trying to find the sasquatch. ",

I jumped up numerous turkey and deer while hiking. So I parked the car, rolled down the windows, shut the car off and just listened and watched. Not even 10 mins go by and this large black thing just starts walking across the open all the way to the other side. I get out of the car to get closer to see it, soon as I do that it see\u0092s me then steps into the tree line . I hurried back to my car and watched from the cab. I called an individual and on the phone with them while I\u0092m still watching it. At first before I started recording I noticed it and for a second I thought a hiker or hunter. But it\u0092s posture and how it moved didn\u0092t look right. To me it looked hunched over or like it\u0092s shoulders we\u0092re rolled forward. I showed a buddy and he agrees with me so idk. Found a dismantled deer very close by. Head was missing and front legs were ripped off. Their was a document sighting on BFRO about 1 mile or so from here. I have a video of the subject and photo\u0092s of the deer. I was very close to the shoal river. Thick tye dye swamp very close by.",
