Was with 2 friends who asked me how far the land goes and if anyone lives down there. They had a sort of 1000 yard stare down the power lines. I look up to see what they were looking at and about 200 yards down the powerlines we see a massive bipedal creature walking towards us. It stopped when it noticed us and took a fast left turn into the woods.",
