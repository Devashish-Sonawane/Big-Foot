            "Follow-Up Report": "Photo of the track line:Please click on the above link to see more photos and a video of these tracks.The witness contacted me January 16th 2018 about this latest snow print discovery. I was unable to arrive to the scene but asked fellow Missouri BFRO investigator Jeff Lansman to go there the next morning being time was of the essence. Jeff took a number of pictures and measurements. The prints were not degraded by thaw due to the severe cold temperatures of the previous 24 hours.   The snow was powder fine but a warm up would soon melt the evidence away by the next day. Jeff is approx. 6'7\" and when he went to take pictures even he could not meet the stride between the tracks. I also asked BFRO investigator  Larry Newman to advise the witness as how to properly measure and record the tracks.I think this set of tracks is very interesting because I believe this is a set of an adult and a juvenile.Later that week I personally showed up at the witness' home and went over the path that was taken when the event took place. I've known these witnesses for almost 10 years and can confidently say that their integrity is beyond approach. They have never led me to believe that their findings were nothing less than what they claim to be true. ",

I was on a back road near the Spokane River at Seven Mile, which is part of the Riverside Park area. As I came up a small hill with a turn, on the left side of the road, just off the road, I saw what appeared to be the silhouette of a sasquatch. I frequently drive this road and had not had a sighting before or since. What I saw was slightly taller than a speed limit/road sign. I looked away to check the road, and when I glanced back over there was nothing to see. I have tried to explain this as being tired, but I am awake at about 4am every day, so I\u0092ve ruled that out. I checked this page and saw the report from the gal near the old golf course, which I live on the other end of that course. This sighting was not far from where she was when she heard her strange howl. What makes me say \u0093if\u0094 I saw is that what I saw was gray, but I did not see any defining features other than that it was a straight on back view.",
