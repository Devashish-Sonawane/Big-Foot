The Pacific Northwest is the main area we've climbed in, and the area we know the best. He is a hardcore skeptic. I on the other hand am a firm believer. I've done tons of research through books and documentaries and consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable about the subject. After this experience my friend is now been having some second thoughts.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I had a lengthy and pleasant phone conversation with this gentleman on 3/20/2021. His recollection of the encounter details was very good.  He sent me a couple photos and a short video from his cellphone which had an audible and distinct \"knock\" recorded within.  The \"footprint\" photo he provided is inconclusive as it shows shoe imprints near the point where the toe section of the footprint should be.  Also, the \"stick structure\" photos are primarily of chainsaw cut alders, likely done by trail  maintenance crews after a high-wind blow down of the trees.  He told me that at approximately 6 AM on the morning of August 10, 2016, he and his friend arrived at the trailhead of a popular hike off the Mountain Loop Highway, south of Darrington.  Theirs was the only vehicle in the parking area.  As they exited the vehicle to prepare for their hike. They began hearing tree knocks approximately 30 -40 yards up the trail from them, and answering knocks the same distance away below them.    Standing there and somewhat stunned by the knocks, they then heard what they believed to be footsteps and the occasional crunch on branches from the uphill direction.  During this time, several small sticks were purportedly throw in their direction. The Hikers responded with knocking and rock clacking, and received responses.  After a short period everything went quiet and the Hikers ventured out on their hike and did not hear anything more.  3 days later upon returning to the same trailhead (which is actually the point of beginning for two separate trails) is when the footprint and stick structures were found.This location is in close proximity to where I previously found prints while investigating a track find reported by a Forester.____________________________________________[Investigator Notes (Matt Moneymaker): Here is the Google Maps pin link to the location of this incident.
