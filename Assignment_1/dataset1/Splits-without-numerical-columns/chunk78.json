            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the gentleman about his sighting in person and on the phone.Best to his recollection this occurred on March 27, 2021 between 8-8:30 am. Prior to this event he never gave a thought to a skunkape or bigfoot being anything other than folklore. On the morning of March 27, he was preparing breakfast with his wife. The kitchen has a window that looks across their backyard. When he turned to ask his wife a question movement outside the window caught his eye. He saw a dark bipedal figure walk from a group of trees toward a wooded area before disappearing from his line of sight. He asked his wife if she had seen that, just as his 8 year old granddaughter came running from the dining room yelling \u0093Grandpa, did you see that?\u0094 She had seen the figure as well from the back sliding glass door. She described it as \u0093big.\u0094 He admits that he at first wondered what his neighbor was wearing but realized it was taller than his 6\u00924\u0094 neighbor. He went on to describe that the figure was about 50 ft away, with a slim build but tall. It was walking west to east (L to R) as they was looking north out the windows.The family is very credible as to what happened that morning. It was obviously something they had never expected to see or experience.When researching this area it is not necessarily an area that one would expect to have this sort of activity. However the homes are spaced out on one acre or more lots and some are heavily wooded. His back yard connects to Manasota Scrub Preserve which connects to agricultural and green areas and then Myakka State Forest. Much of that area at the time of this sighting was very dry without having had substantial rain for many months which may have driven this animal towards water and in this case Forked Creek which is across the street from this man\u0092s home",
