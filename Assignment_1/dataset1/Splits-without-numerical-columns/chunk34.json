            "Follow-Up Report": "I called this witness. He said that it was his wife who actually had the experience. He put her on the phone. I asked her to describe what had happened.She said that she was camping with her kids at the state park nearby. It was late September 2018. The trip lasted for two nights. There were ten people in the group, all sleeping in tents. At 2:00 \u0096 3:00 AM, she heard a \u0093Whoop-whoop-whoop\u0094 call that she said sounded animal-like, not bird-like. The first time, it was right near the tents. She said that it sounded like it was right outside her tent. She heard more whoops, and it appeared to be moving away to the north.He husband said that he had filed a report previously on the BFRO website, but never heard back. I checked for reports under his name, but was unable to find the report. In this incident, he was up by Chrystal Village. Washington, driving on Hwy 410, and saw a tall, bi-pedal creature cross the road from his left to right. It was summer, and late morning. The distance was about 400 yards away.He then told of a sighting that his father had back in 1957 near Aberdeen, Washington. He was on Hwy 12 heading west towards Aberdeen. There were four people in the car. A tall bi-pedal creature walked across the road just before entering the town. All four people saw it. They slowed down, and all could smell it.In my opinion, there were most likely a couple of sasquatches that were passing through the area. It is common for sasquatches to vocalize to keep track of each other as they move about. Also, there are other reports of sightings in this area. Report #50214.  This type of vocalization has been reported many times. Further, this part of the Kitsap peninsula is very wooded, and with the close proximity of Puget Sound saltwater shore, this is excellent habitat. ",

We hiked the trails for about two hours without much luck finding anything. I did find tree structures near the area where hunting is prohibited, and I took a picture of each of the two potential tree structures we had found. So as we were heading back to our car after hiking for two hours, I decided to pick up a stick and try making some wood knocks. To our surprise, there was a response.",
