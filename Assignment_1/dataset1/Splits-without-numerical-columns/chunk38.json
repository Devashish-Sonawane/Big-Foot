            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness and his wife at his home. The witness provided these additional details of the occurrences near his home.In the Spring of 2016, the witness took a evening walk with his wife through some woods near his home. After returning home, on a cloudy, misty day, between 8 and 9 PM, the witness glanced back at the woods from his backyard and caught movement about 150 yards away across an open field. He observed the back of a tall upright hair-covered creature standing perfectly still and looking into the area where he had just been walking. After a few seconds, it quickly moved into the woods. At first he thought it might have been a homeless person wearing a fur coat, but realized that it was far too tall and broad. In our re-creation, he estimated that it was over 7 feet tall and at least 3 feet across the shoulders. He also noticed water dripping from the hair on its back, that it had no visible neck, a peaked head shape, and was caramel colored. He could see it from the knees up. He did not see the face or any arm movement. In a later search of this wooded area, the witness found a bed or blind about 9 feet long enclosed with sticks and covered with vegetation. An opening about 3 feet square was observed on one side. He also found a large 5 inch wide human-like foot track near the pond that showed evidence of sliding. Additionally, he described a smell like skunk mixed with road kill being present in this area.On another occasion, near dark, the witness and his wife observed a group of coyotes feeding on something in the field behind their home. He noticed that the coyotes were on alert to some other creature lying on the ground about 40 yards from them. The witness described this creature as a long shape with a rounded head that it would raise occasionally to peer at the coyotes. The witness\u0092 wife thought it might have been a panther but it was too dark to tell. On other occasions, the witness has heard unusual night vocalizations and wood knocks. The last occurrence was in the early spring of 2017, when very late at night, the witness heard 4 distinct wood knocks west of his home answered by 3 wood knocks east of his home. The open field area of the sightings is now a construction zone for a new hospital. The wooded section with a small pond remains, but we found lots of commercial litter that the witness says was not present when he had his sightings. A large culvert under a divided 4 lane highway connects this pond with a creek in a large suburban park. I also explored the park and found no trails or signs of human intrusion in much of the wooded area of the park. The undergrowth was very thick and impassible along most of the creek.Although this sighting is in a very developed residential area within the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Area, in checking Google Earth, escape routes to wild areas near Joe Pool Lake exist along the creeks. I found the resident to be very credible and believe he had an encounter in a most unlikely location.",

            "Observed": "I was on my way to the vet and on highway 47 as I came over a hill and Crested the top of the hill I saw a Bigfoot standing on the shoulder it was the only thing in my entire viewing area besides woods on each side it was dark brown in appearance it had two legs and one arm as I saw a profile view it jumped off into the ditch line and went into the woods. I immediately thought of what I just saw & my conclusion was a bigfoot. It was vertical & on a slight angle as it was ready to go into the woods. It was heading g north. I could see the width of legs & its body shape only but I was at too far a distance to make out hair or face. There  was nothing to abstruct my view because what was in back of him was shoulder and the road that continued West which also went up to a hill I only saw it because I crested over the hill it was plain as day what it was until he disappeared into the woods. I immediately called my husband and he got to the site I described approximately 45 minutes later. He reported seeing something had jumped and made a clearing into a small snow bank and also reported seeing some sort of tracks going along a deer trail which led to a deer carcass. The deer also had no front legs they were snapped off at the knees",
