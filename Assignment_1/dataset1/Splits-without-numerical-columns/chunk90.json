            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness just a little over 2 months since his event. He was clear and succinct as to the sighting.He is a retired medical technician and meticulous with details.As he mentioned he was driving alone while his wife was caring for her mother. This is an area he is quite familiar with, as he hunts a nearby conservation area with a buddy during turkey season every year. As he got on the trail, he noted all the people on the trail were riding bikes. There was no foot traffic. It was a clear sunny day and vision was excellent. He saw the creature about 100 yards away from him up the road. The road is straight and clear, with no obstructions between he and the figure.Details of sighting and description of the creature: He was cruising along at 10 MPH and was basically at idling speed and had his foot mostly on the brake due to the bikers. When he saw the figure it was coming from the direction of the river. It was walking at a brisk pace \"like it had a purpose\". He stopped the car when he saw it, \"about 100 yards away, no further\". The general coloration of the creature \"blended in with the chipped rock road, mostly grey & brown with a few black patches\". \"Kind of splotchy\". It seemed to be \"wet from the thighs on down and gave the impression of having dark legs, but it was likely because of having been in the (Hatrsburg) creek\". \"When I first saw it I thought it may have been an indigent or homeless person wearing a hood\". He then started moving towards it and thought it was not a person but rather a Sasquatch. \"It had a conical head and a massive build with very very long arms that swung a lot as it walked\". He got no facial or otherwise physical features since it was at a mostly side profile. The figure then quickened its pace and headed out through a freshly planted soybean field (ankle high) and disappeared into some woods. Duration of the sighting was 1.5 to 2 minutes. ",
