He was an ex- police officer and a current pastor of a church.The submitter purposely asked his brother what he saw before saying a word as to not influence him. They saw the same thing. It reminded them both of an orangutan.The witness added that the figure was moving extremely fast, with a sense of urgency, but much more graceful than a human.It was a brief sighting, but given the clear daylight hours, two witnesses, and a description that fits no other creature, this qualifies as Class A.",
