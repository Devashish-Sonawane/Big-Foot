            "Observed": "Traveling west on Highway 60 out of Brazos County TX into Burleson County TX , 200-300 yards after crossing the Brazos river I seen a large dark object on the side of the road. I was traveling about 80mph,so I passed it rather fast, this dark object rose up to a standing position and took a leap into the darkness.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness by phone a few hours after the report, whom seems very credible. A retired veteran, leaving work from the local VFW, witnesses a creature stand up from a squatted position and step off the road. Follow up investigation reveals prints, food, bedding and escape path. 1.  Witness leaves work at 2:30am and heads west on farm road 60 from College Station, TX. Traveling west he crosses the Brazos River bridge. Of note, the river is quite flooded from Hurricane Harvey, pushing some wildlife north. As he comes off the bridge he sees what he thinks is a large hog. However, it almost immediately stands up and steps off the road out of view. 2.  The creature was viewed only for about two seconds. The witness  saw a very tall and thick bipedal creature stand and take a step. It was very dark in color but he could not make out hair or other features. He estimates the creature to be 8ft tall and is confident in his measurement. This is due to his observation of street signs lining up with the bottom of his rear view mirror and that this creature was slightly taller than a street sign. I measured two nearby street signs that were both at about 8ft in height. The witness also claims the creature was as wide as a very large hog. 3.  My interview of the witness revealed a man who was absolute in his opinion these creatures don't exist until this event. He was shaken, drove straight home and woke up his wife. After a coupe of hours he filed the report. 4. I asked the witness to return to the site and determine if any further evidence was there. Within a few minutes of his arrival he found seven prints at the bottom of the road's embankment.  The prints are on a farm being tilled so he attempted to cast the prints. 5. I arrived at the site a few days later at 11pm and investigated the area until 4am with the witness. Observations:a.  The river is bordered with 50 to 100 feet of forest followed by farming for 100 miles north and south. b.  The creature's steps indicate it ran down the embankment and came to a hard stop, with those two prints having the most depth and features. It then stepped back toward the embankment and walked through high cane back to the river. It was obvious something large went through about 250 feet of cane. No prints were found in the cane.Photo of pathway: c.  Along the side of the road where the creature was squatted were cucumber plants from previous years (since cotton is the current crop). d.  The next day I also found a bedding area at the point of the river and bridge. It was 25 feet into the cane and woods, large enough for several deer or one large animal.  See photo:There were also some smaller prints found under the bridge but looked human. 5.  The prints that were cast form the shape of a foot but have very little detail. This is due to the hard, crunchy dirt they were embedded in. However,  one print had a pretty decent big toe and heal. It along with another print that was clearly a foot made up the two stop steps mentioned above. See photo:Additionally, there was one print that was not cast that also clearly looked like a foot. Casting though would bring up all the tiny pebble sized dirt under the print and delete its features. ",
