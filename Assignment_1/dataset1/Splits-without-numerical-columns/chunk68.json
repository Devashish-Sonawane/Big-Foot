            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness and his wife, an additional witness, via the telephone and the following info may be added to the original report. The 3 campers were in a triangle formation while asleep in their individual hammocks and tent. The campfire and picnic table were in the middle of them. The male witness is a 10 year police veteran, 4 year USMC veteran, and has worked in a maximum security prison for over two decades. He is also an avid outdoorsman who hikes and camps the Appalachian Trail twice per year.  When his hammock was smacked/slapped, he awoke and was wide awake with his heart pounding.\u0094  Due to his background, this is not a man that scares easily and knew right away that this was no walnut strike. I next spoke to the co-witness (the wife). She stated that the bipedal footsteps walked up to her tent, checked it out from all sides, then moved on to her friend\u0092s tent, and finally to her husband\u0092s hammock where the slap occurred. This whole sequence was brief and did not last long. The first howl occurred within a few minutes of the footsteps departure, while the second one was occurred about 15 minutes following the first.  They were both the same and described as a siren with a \u0093woo woo\u0094 at the end, brief pause, and then another \u0093woo woo.\u0094 It was a \u0093very very strong and deep sound and the direction it was heard from was where the footsteps walked away from camp.\u0094 Prints were searched for in the morning, but due to the leaves being stuck to the ground, due to moisture, nothing was found. No odor was smelt and there was no food left out overnight at the camp ground.   ",
