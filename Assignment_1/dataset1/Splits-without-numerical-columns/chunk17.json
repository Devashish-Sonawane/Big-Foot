They were taking a nature walk through the nearby forest as the snow was not too deep at the time.She and her mother were walking somewhat apart at the time. As P.S. was walking south she saw what appeared to be a six foot tall being covered in bright red, shaggy hair walking upright away from her. It was approximately 50 to 100 yards away and walking parallel to the road.She described it as having very broad shoulders and noted that its hands were swinging down by its knees as it walked. It had an oval shaped head with a peak at the top. She wasn't fearful, but just stood there in disbelief. She didn't follow it or go look for tracks.P.S. seemed to be a very credible whiteness telling an honest account of her experience.",
