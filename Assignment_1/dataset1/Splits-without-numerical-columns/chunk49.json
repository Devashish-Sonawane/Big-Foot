Weeds had been very high with LOTS of deer (and moose) traveling around and through the course.  Course was mowed at the request of homeowners due to fire concerns, so there was a significant change to the 90-acres that was the golf course.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness by phone on Sept. 6, 2020. She is a professional business woman who has worked in the Employee Benefit Consulting environment for more than 25 years.  She most recently held the title of Vice President, Director of Global Benefits for a very large (global) Insurance Brokerage Firm. She and her husband had lived in the San Francisco Bay Area.  In 2018 her husband (an Air Force Veteran and career Civilian Federal employee) became eligible for retirement.  They seized the moment, took advantage of his retirement opportunity and relocated to the Spokane area. She states \"We are avid campers (tent) and try to get away as often as we can. While living in CA we camped all over the state, often in the Tahoe region or Yosemite, but also in the Redwoods north and along the coast.  Since we moved to Spokane (July 2018) we have camped at Palouse Falls State Park (WA), Hells Canyon State Park (ID), Farragut State Park (ID), and Whitefish Lake State Park (MT), not to mention Mt Rushmore, Grand Teton, and Yellowstone NP last summer. In short, we are outside in nature quite a bit.\"Encounter:It was on September 2nd, 2020 around 2:15 to 2:30am and it was clear out and fairly well lit with a full moon. The temperature was around 55 to 60 degrees F. She had let her dog out and heard what she initially thought was a police siren winding up but it got louder and louder then wound down and stopped. She said she then heard what sounded like another one much farther off. Possibly a reply. She has been around coyote, etc. and said this was definitely not a coyote or dog. She said she did notice a strong skunk type odor but it was worse and more \"trashy\" smelling.  Additional:The witness feeds various animals around her property. Squirrels, birds, etc. and puts out old apples for deer. She has a heavy wooden feeder screwed into a tree with a heavy lid on hinges and a plexiglass front. She is 5'9 tall and has to be on her toes and arms fully extended upwards to open it and fill it. There is a hole about 2 inch diameter in the side so squirrels can get to the feed as well. Something tried to pull it off of the tree and ripped the lid completely off of it. No claw marks or tooth marks from chewing/gnawing so probably not a bear although bear have been seen by a neighbor on his 20 acre property about 3 miles north. A neighbor said that others have had sightings of \"something\" over recent years. The local hardware store has Sasquatch pictures and a statue. The area around her is surrounded by forests and canyons, rivers, streams, and she is 9 miles northwest of downtown Spokane. Lake Pend Oreille is about 25 miles to her northeast. Colville National Forest is about 15 miles to her north and Kootenai National Forest looks to be about 20 miles northeast. Summary:I believe she is a credible witness and gave a compelling report. I found other reports in the BFRO database as recent as winter 2017. (see Report 56332). This report in particular is only 21 miles northeast of her location. There was also a media article (see BFRO Media Article 237) which was written from information found in a letter written in April 1840 by the Reverend Elkanah Walker, a Protestant missionary to the Spokane Indians. I plan to make a trip up to one of the surrounding national forests to camp and explore. ",
