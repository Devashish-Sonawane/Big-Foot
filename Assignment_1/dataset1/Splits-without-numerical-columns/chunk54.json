            "Observed": "Had an awesome experience the weekend of July 26th 2019. While camping with my son and his 2 friends, at Eisenhower State Park, in Texas. We were sitting around the camp fire at night, about 9:15 pm, we all heard two howls south of our camp sight. Very deep howls, each lasting 5 to 7 seconds long each, with a small pause between. About 10 seconds later, another howl north west of camp. Higher pitch and feminine sounding.",
            "AirportCode": "KGYI",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. In addition to his written report, he provided the following information about this encounter.Due to the heat in this part of Texas in July, the witness, his son, and 2 friends were the only campers in this campground. Their campsite was the most northern one on the south side of Lake Texoma. The first set of 2 howls came from woods to the south of their campsite. They were very deep and separated by a 10 second break. The witness is an experienced camper and has heard wolves in Utah and coyotes and said these howls were much deeper and more powerful. He estimated that they came from at least 100 yards south of their position. The higher pitched, more feminine howl appeared to come from across the lake, 300 yards or more distant. After the \u0093whoop\u0094 was heard, the witness did smell a slight odor but thought it may have been a skunk. Further exploration toward the first set of vocalizations revealed a freshly snapped green tree branch approximately 2 inches in diameter, 10 feet from the ground, and over 2 feet from the tree trunk. The witness is an experienced camper and self-admitted bigfoot enthusiast. He has attended various bigfoot conferences and has had other possible encounters in Utah, his previous state of residence. I found him to be articulate, honest, and consistent in describing this experience.",

We had gone for about 45 minutes away from the house, seeing lots of wildlife along the trails including deer, rabbit and moose. There were lots of tracks along the way as well. We came upon a trail where all of a sudden the deer trails we had been following, swerved off the main trail and up the hillside. Up ahead was a single set of tracks that appeared to be a bi-pedal animal of some kind and there the smell was something awful.",
