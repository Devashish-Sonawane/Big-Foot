            "Follow-Up Report": "I did a site visit on 9/28/19 with the home owner in xxxx VT to discuss her day time encounter from 8/6/19. We discussed her experiences and she gave me a tour of her property and the surrounding area where she had her sighting and has experienced other unusual happenings. The property owner was very cordial and felt the need to share her experiences. She gave background information on the geography of the local area as well as animals native to her surroundings, including the visit by a bull moose just hours before my arrival.On the morning of the sighting she had her pet Chihuahua outside in a large metal cage/kennel (due to a previous run in with a large coy-wolf) when she heard it starting to growl. Upon hearing the growling, she went outside to make sure the coy-wolf had not returned. She noticed the direction her dog was looking and heard something walking in the woods between her property and the neighbors lot next door. She thought it was probably a deer as they have been seen cutting through that side the property in the past. Both she and her dog were following the sound of the footsteps as they headed towards the dirt road in front of her home. To her surprise instead of seeing a deer walk past the end of her driveway she saw a slightly hunched over black figure step up out of the drainage ditch into her driveway. What caught her attention was how it was walking on two legs and the length of its arms in relation to its body. Unfortunately it never looked in her direction as it was looking across the road towards the forest on the other side so she did not see its face.She then re-positioned herself on her porch to look through an opening in the trees towards a neighbors house diagonally across the road to try to catch another glimpse of the creature. After waiting a number of seconds and not seeing the creature pass she quickly got an air horn and went out to look up the road to see if she could see where it went. At that point she came to the realization that what she had seen was a Bigfoot.Not seeing anything she went to her neighbors house to ask if he had anyone staying with him or had seen anyone walking down the road. He didn't have anyone staying at his home and did not see anyone/anything that morning. He did mention that a bear had been around recently and had gotten into his garbage. It appears the creature had entered the woods on the opposite side of the road between the homeowners house and her neighbors. When asked if it could have been a bear she said she was positive that it wasn't a bear. She is very familiar with bears due to the number of bears that have been in her yard and on her property. She has seen bears standing up in her garden and their arms/legs were much shorter in relation to their bodies than the creature she saw cross her driveway.While investigating, the homeowner and her husband found matted grass in the drainage ditch at the edge of the road where something had walked. They found 3 footprints in the hard dirt at the bottom of their driveway and on the road. Due to the surface composition they were barely visible other than a heavy heel strike and some toe impressions. She was able to approximate the being/creatures height as around 6' tall, give or take, by having her husband stand in the sighting location. Not long after that (8/16/19) while out hiking along the road the homeowner came across a hollow tree and struck it three times with her hiking stick. To her surprise she got a response back from across the river that runs behind her property. Intrigued she did it again and got six responses to the ten knocks she did. This made her nervous and she decided against continuing. On another occasion (9/19/19) while walking on the road (through a very dense section of pine trees) about a half a mile from her home she encountered something throwing rocks up into a tall pine tree knocking pine cones to the ground, Staying very quiet she stood watching as rock after rock kept knocking large pine cones to the ground. Whoever/whatever was throwing the rocks was on the other side of the tree in thick overgrowth across a small stream. A neighbor drove up the road and stopped to say hello. The woman was a little scared at this point and with her neighbor there it gave her the courage/opportunity to quickly make her way back home. The following day she returned with her husband only to find the pine trees in this section of the forest had no pine cones on them and there were none on the ground. It appeared that whoever/whatever knocked the pine cones down had collected them and taken them from the area.The homeowner is a retired nurse and private pilot. She and her husband split their time between living in VT (to be near family) and wintering in FL. They have owned and lived in this part of rural VT for approximately five years. In that time they have been welcomed/accepted into the community and others have shared their stories of their Bigfoot encounters or those of their friends. Two of those sightings have been on/near their road, one being a face to face encounter by a local hunter a few miles from their home. She also provided me with a newspaper clipping from a local newspaper of other Bigfoot encounters in VT as well as a sighting in a neighboring community. The area where the homeowner and her husband live is in a beautiful rural setting approximately 30 minutes south of the Canadian border. The home sits on top of a ridge where the land gently slopes into a valley with a pristine river on the back side of their property. There is also a set of power lines that cuts through the wilderness not far from their home. Long Trail State Forest is in close proximity to their home. The area has a great diversity of animals, both large and small and there is also trout in the river that cuts through the property.I found the homeowner to be very sincere and a credible witness. Here's a photo of the area.",

            "Observed": "Oh my God is all that we can say. It is Thursday 08/23/18 and we are just getting to our vehicle from a harrowing hike. We were hiking the road at Kenosha Pass on the east side that takes you to the twin cones above tree line. We began our hike at noon and hiked up the road. We reached the twin cone tree line area at 3:30pm. It was a beautiful and uneventful hike until we were headed back down the road. My daughter had said she thought that she had heard a tree knock and I was being silly and took a rock and knocked on a large rock off of the road and then tossed the rock about 5 ft off of the road. Literally 2 minutes later we both heard multiple loud tree knocking and rocks were whizzing past our heads. The stench was unbearable-like nothing I have ever smelled before. My 21yr.old daughter began to scream and cry as we were under attack by someone or something. I was so startled that I just stood there frozen as this dark figure was staring back at me. I couldn\u0092t move. My daughter grabbed my arm and we took off. I had an air horn that I depressed 3 times as we were running away and that seemed to deter the rock throwing. The rock throwing continued for 5 more minutes as we ran down the hill. We were almost to our vehicle which was parked off the dirt road when we heard a loud guttural whoop off the road abit and we just kept running to the car so very very afraid! We made it back to our vehicle at 6:15pm. I will never return and we are not okay with this. This needs to be investigated please.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with both witnesses via phone and email immediately after the sighting report was submitted.  Both witnesses seemed very credible and genuine, and were able to describe the encounter in great detail.Both witnesses were clearly upset by the encounter, and expressed their desire to never visit the location again.I visited the site of the encounter myself on the following Monday.  The activity took place just below a treeline at approximately 11,000 ft of elevation.  I did observe what appeared to be a partial footprint, and discovered a possible hiding/sleeping area as well, which had a very distinct odor.  The odor was notable, but not as intense as described by the witnesses during their encounter.The mother provided slightly more detail with regards to her observation of the actual creature.  She emphasized her strong feeling that the creature was hostile and that she felt it might charge at her and her daughter.  The daughter purposely did not look at the creature due to the sheer terror she felt at the time.  The mother felt that deploying the air horn gave them the opportunity to leave the scene without further interaction with the figure she observed.  Since rocks were being thrown from another direction at the time of the sighting, it would seem clear that there were multiple creatures.  The witnesses were clear that they were followed several miles down the mountain back to their car, and at that point, they were further startled by a loud roar/scream from the treeline.Athough they felt that they were under attack, they were not hit by any rocks.  We have received many reports of rock throwing, which is most likely an intimidation behavior where they wish for you to leave. If they wanted to hit their mark, a human, they would be able to if that is what they were aiming for, without much effort. ",
