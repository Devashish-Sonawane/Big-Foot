He did state that the way the creature was positioned over the table and able to reach across it confirms it was not a black bear. He said it was too large and a bear could not have got into that position. No tracks were found. The only thing that was really messed with was the charcoal which the creature seemed highly interested in. ",

We heard 3 long vocalizations or howls that were identical to Sasquatch howls you hear demonstrated on tv or online.  Did not sound like coyote or cows for sure. This is a fairly isolated area in a national forest.  Son-in-law is a hunter who is familiar with animals and sounds in the area.",

He was stopped on Hwy 176 roughly one mile north/west of Mount Bethel Garmany Road.George and his adult son-in-law hunter say the howls were \"Ohio Howls\" (Google it). Local people should know about this report. It is very recent.Satellite images show the surrounding area to be a huge, thick, forest zone where bigfoots could easily reside undisturbed. Google \"Molly's Rock Picnic Area\" to see map and satellite images.",
