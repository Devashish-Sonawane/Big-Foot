            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone: The witness has worked as a logger and tree planter. He enjoys exploring old homesteads and was doing that on this day when he saw the figure 200 to 225 yards away. The sunlight was behind the black figure. It was huge, about eight and one half to nine feet tall based on the height of the surrounding trees. The head went onto estimated three feet wide shoulders. The figure then sidestepped and tried to hide behind a little, sparse tree. The witness observed it for one and one half to two minutes. He did not see arms move. He did not detect any foul odor. If the figure was closer and more detail seen, this would be Class A report. Under other stories: about one and one quarter miles away from here, in April 2019, the witness heard a whistle fifty to one hundred yards away. He saw his friend in the other direction and as he was watching his friend, he heard another whistle.  ",
