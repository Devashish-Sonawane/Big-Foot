My family and I as well as our neighbors have heard wood knocks come from that area.

            "Follow-Up Report": "Follow-up on March 2017 update:There is ongoing activity on his, and neighboring properties. Activity includes howls, knocks, tree pushing and structures, and bone stacking.As stated, they were alerted by the aggressive nature of the dog barking. When they went outside and  hit it with the spotlight, witness was virtually certain this is the same creature they have seen before. Not much detail could be seen but they were able to get a good indication of height, weight, overall stature, and it was even running from, and towards, the same area it ran towards during his first encounter. This was not the first time they have been alerted to activity by the dog. There are other times the dog will growl, but not bark, at outside activity, and they are considering the possibility that they are being observed from outside the home at night. This witness is a straight shooter, and I don't doubt the veracity of his event.-----------------------------Spoke with the witness via phone. The events he has mentioned were over a 1-2 year period, but the catalyst for the report was the sighting of the creature. I will address the sighting first, then the peripheral incidents/events. Sighting was in the last six months. Witness is an avid bow hunter and is quite familiar with any and all wildlife, and is quite certain what this creature was NOT.  Not bear, big cat, hog, etc. He works late into the evening, and on occasion, as a habit when he comes home, he drives onto his property past his house and up to the top of a hill and scans the slight valley with his headlights, just to see what wildlife is around.On the night of his sighting, he had crested the hill and went slightly downward to cast his headlights on the valley. At about 100 yards distance, running south to north and slightly away from him, he saw a massive creature, running on all fours. At the immediate first glance, he noted the \"eyes were glowing orange\" as the creature was looking at the direction of he and car headlights. As it continued at \"an incredible speed for a creature that size\" it turned its head at the direction it was running, but the eyes continued to emit the eye glow, which was visible from the side angle. By his own admission, he did not focus on the overall physical traits, but he did note at the first initial sighting, his gut reaction was a dark brown/reddish hue. The entire sighting lasted no more than 10 seconds.He has looked up what he thought he saw on our site, as well as others, and without a doubt, an ape, chimp, baboon, etc walking/running on fours is what he describes it to be. Nothing less. I will address the other events as well, in order of what may considered of importance: He has sent me 19 photos of many of the trees/structures/nests. (A). He had found multiple dead/mutilated deer, with large chunks \"torn out of the side and haunches\". He states he knows what big cat/bear attacks look like and according to him the damage does not match what he normally finds. The deer were not hunter kills that took of running and later dropped. No wounds were found and most were fresh kills. Does not exclude the possibility that he may have missed a wound.(B). He found several stacks of animal bones on a tree that had been snapped. and bent over to a horizontal position about a foot above the ground. Three or four bones were arranged in triangle or rectangular shapes and balanced on the tree. He had asked his young son if he had done this, and the answer was no. By the time he got back to the tree, the bones were on the ground. There were a good number of other bones lying about, in the immediate area.(C). He has numerous photos of trees/multiple trees, bent over in what could be described as structures and or \"dens\". Allowing for snow weight, wind or wind shear and natural tree fall, there are a few photos that could use further scrutiny. Without scale, measurements and multiple angle photos though, these would have to be \"of unknown cause\", but the supporting incidents reported by him and others may give support to his \"theories\". I do find one or two of the photos to be compelling. Here are some of his photos:(D). Knocks and howls. He started hearing knocks, usually one solo knock, but sometimes 2, as he returned home. On a whim, he started returning the knocks, and eventually he got a knock in return. Then he initiated the knock(s) and got return knocks. He had also heard a loud howl/scream, and upon visiting BFRO data base, he was certain it was a Sasquatch. He could compare it to nothing else. As an overall encounter report, it would be my opinion that he does have something going on out there. I will continue to be in touch with this witness.Update 5/22/17 - I have had occasion to speak with this witness several times. I believe it to be the same creature, as the size, stature, and orange glow have been reported on several occasions. Also the alerts from their dogs and cats indicate a different alert than they normally have from the animals on other typical and known animals.This witness submitted the following:\"Night at about 10:30 to 11:00 clear calm weather. Starry night with half Moon. We were watching TV and my son was just put to bedIn among our oak trees and Cedars about 75 yards from our house. Our dog began to bark non-stop pointing his nose in the same direction for a few minutes. My wife and I listened and watched our dog out our front door, then my oldest son came from his bedroom concerned about our dog because of the bigfoot that is in our woods. I told him I know he is barking and that was not his normal bark so at that time we brought our dog inside and I grabbed my spot light and my wife,son and I stepped out on our porch I scanned the barn then across our pond and down into the trees and into huge orange glowing eyes that were about 8 to 9 foot off the ground, seeing evidence that I have already reported to your organization all three of us knew exactly what we was looking at. I yelled at it and it tried to hide its face behind a oak tree only for it to keep looking back at us several times, this continues for about 3 minutes until finally it ran off. We were all shocked as to the mass of the bigfoots size and it's speed. We all had a very good look at it and my wife said did you just see that? in disbelief. She has since talked about the size of its arm on a few occasions. Its our belief that it comes up close to our house many nights since then, like tonight because of the way our dog acts and barks.\"",
