            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness. He is credible. He is the manager of the Surf Hut restaurant in Miramar Beach.  He lives in Niceville and spends much time hiking on Eglin Air Force Base -- a vast unpopulated area in the Florida Panhandle. He was parked in the powerline cut just off Colonel Greg Malloy Road, also called Range Road 211. Specifically, he was parked where the powerline access road is roped off.  Roughly 10 minutes after arriving he saw the figure crossing the powerline cut some distance away to the north. See Google Maps link above for the approximate crossing point. He believes the figure was just to the north from where Pearl Creek crosses the powerline cut, perhaps 40 yards or so beyond the small creek bed (which is not very visible in the video).He was too far from the figure to see details. He was also fully zoomed in with his smartphone camera. No details are visible in the video, but it is clearly dark and upright and bipedal, so either a human in dark clothes or a bigfoot. It is deer bow hunting season in Florida. Anyone in this area (a hunting unit of Elgin AFB) is required to wear a blaze orange hunting vest. The figure was definitely not wearing a blaze orange hunting vest. With his own eyes he says it was a solid dark figure and it seemed leaned over forward a bit.The sighting is important partly because of the number of other reports from this general area, including one within a few miles just a few weeks ago.There are many deer in this area. There is a lush river bed not far away (the Shoal River) and swamps nearby. The Florida Trail is not far away either. Many sightings in Florida occur within short proximity of the Florida Trail.Upon my request the witness has created a YouTube channel and uploaded the video. Click here for the video. If you have an interest in this sighting and follow up information then you should subscribe to his channel. He will post more videos of his findings in the area, including some interesting deer kills with legs broken.  He has been returning to the area every day since the sighting and will continue to do so.",

            "AirportCode": "KMWL",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. Since the incident occurred over a year ago, I did not go to the location to search for further evidence, but have traveled this road on several occasions. In addition to his report, the witness provided the following details. While traveling south on Tin Top Road at night, he saw movement on the left side of the road approaching the highway. He slowed his vehicle to about 40 mph and was at the closest 100 feet from the creature when it appeared to stumble, enter the highway, briefly pause, and then take off at high speed into an overgrown weed field on the right side of the highway. He remarked that no human could have moved that fast at night in that field. He described the creature as about 7 feet tall, on two legs, and an outline like a body builder with excessively long arms. In his headlights, he could see the distinct shape and that it had no clothes, but could not see details such as color or details of hair. When it paused in the road, he could not see if it looked at him. He did not observe eye shine but did notice a skunk smell that may or may not have been associated with what he saw. He estimated the total time of the encounter to be about 5 seconds. Although he slowed initially, after the creature ran into the weed field, he continued home.Since he is a long time resident of that area, I asked him about any other occurrences that he experienced or knew about. He mentioned several for which he had no explanation and did not seem to be done by a human or any other animal. He once found 5 or 6 goat carcasses hanging by their horns from a single strand of barbed wire near a creek bed. When he was 10 years old in 2006, while near a farm pond, he heard a very powerful scream or roar during midday that frightened him. His brother, who lives nearby, has seen eyes in his window at night, heard tapping on his windows also, and had a door to his home ripped off and the lock was broken but nothing stolen. On another occasion a shed was broken into and a 50 pound bag of trash stolen while many high value items were untouched. These incidents resulted in calls to the Sheriff\u0092s department but no culprit was found.I found the witness to be very sincere, forthright, and with excellent recall of his encounter. This road and the countryside between Weatherford and Granbury, Texas has had a long history of sightings, some of which I have previously investigated.",
