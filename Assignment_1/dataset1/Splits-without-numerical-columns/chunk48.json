            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, David Bedout, by phone. He is very credible and certain about what he and three other witnesses observed that afternoon. He is a retired commercial real estate banker. There were four witness in two golf carts. The witness sitting next to Dave in his golf cart was a retired Delta Airlines pilot.Based on what Dave described, they could have only seen a real sasquatch or a very large (7 foot tall) man in a very convincing sasquatch costume. All four witnesses were certain that it was a real sasquatch. It was definitely not a bear. One part of the observation is particularly interesting: When Dave yelled at the figure it immediately laid down on the ground behind a log (or similar looking debris), before getting back up and walking away. Other witnesses have described a sasquatch reacting this same way -- quickly disappearing from view by laying flat on the ground behind a horizontal obstruction like a log.I asked Dave if he sees any deer (primary food source of sasquatches) around the Whitewater Creek Golf Course. Yes indeed. He says on that particular golf course, among the many he plays on in the vicinity, he usually sees more deer than golfers.The stretch of woods that the sasquatch walked back into is the thick green belt of Whitewater Creek which heads generally south. In that section of creek bed there is a power line cut that follows the creek for a distance toward larger green belts. Due to the proximity to homes, hunting is likely prohibited in the area, making the area a sanctuary for deer during hunting season.For the Google Maps pin for the spot where the sasquatch was first observed, click here. When the witnesses first spotted the figure they were on the other side of the pond, more or less where you see the shadow of the golfer in the Google Maps aerial image linked above.Long/Lat Coordinates: 33.371111, -84.508000",
