This is a very remote location and no one else goes up here often. No trails in so they had to bushwack. Temperatures were in the 80s. They spent the day fishing and cooked trout for supper. Later, while lying in bed, he described what sounded like a loud sharp crack or branch/small tree snap. The he heard the vocalizations in rapid succession. Very loud, guttural and could feel the reverberation in his chest. They explored the area the following morning and could locate no tracks or sign. He told me that some time later watching a documentary, they played the Sierra Sounds and he said what he heard sounded exactly like that. He said \"it sounded like someone in an insane asylum chattering away\". He could barely believe the similarities.
