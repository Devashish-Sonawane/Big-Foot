            "Observed": "Several times a week I go fishing at the James Reed Memorial Wildlife Area just south of Lee's Summit, MO. It's about 900 acres plus 10 lakes to choose from for fishing and a area with walking trails. Each lake has a level, mowed area about 20 feet wide all the way round it. It is wooded and brushy between lakes plus there are also open meadow/fields scattered around. Animal life is deer (lots of them), fox, possums, rabbit, racoon, squirrel, turkey, geese, golden eagles, cranes, vultures and many smaller birds. During the week there aren't many people there fishing so sometimes I'm the only one. I prefer fishing at the lake that is farthest from the main entrance. I think Google Maps shows it as #9 but it has a name.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness. He was a trained observer for over 20 years and was precise about what he saw & heard. The area he was at is a very active area near me and there have been several Class A sightings. One in particular, #40306 and published to BFRO site, is at the exact spot he was at, and he fishes this area several days a week weather permitting. He was unaware of the published report(s) until we spoke.The first event was in early August 2020, and it was his finding a large pile of scat which he was certain was not a horse. This is a conservation area so horses are allowed there but only a few come out there to ride. Though he is knowledgeable about wildlife, this scat pile, though \"plentiful\" did not yield anything other than curiosity. No photo or sample was taken.The second event was later in August 2020. He was fishing while walking slowly around the lake. This is when he heard the \"hoot owl\" call out with three hoots back to back to back within the space of a second, sort of \"rapid fire\". He estimated it was within 150 ft. or less. He is an avid hunter, and has heard most wildlife sounds one would hear in the woods, and this was just \"an unusual version\" of a known bird call. He then walked another 100 feet or so while still fishing. This is when he heard the grunt/huffing sound coming about 20-30 feet behind him from the brush by the tree line. He indicated it created a \"heavy vibration he both felt and heard\" and after the audible sound had dissipated it still \"vibrated within his body (chest) for a few more seconds. We did discuss this part in detail, and he was adamant it was not any type of adrenaline rush or his heart pounding due to a possible fear based reaction to what he thought might have been a dog coming up behind him. It just had a weird effect on him.After the sound and resulting effects, he was not afraid but something told him it was time to get out of there, so he headed home. The last event was early in September. He went to the same lake and wasn't there long before he heard a chimp-like chirping/screeching right behind him in the brush by the tree line. His analogy of it sounding like Cheetah from the old Tarzan movies was pretty accurate, and it was no more than 50 feet or so behind him. He quickly decided it was again time to get out of there.If one were to take all of these events individually they may not be seen as much of anything but anomalies. But this location has had several Class A sightings published by myself and is still a research area of mine as well. His descriptions of the various sights and sounds are very much in line with other reported events with other witnesses here and elsewhere.It is a common habit of people that fish this small lake to throw carp, gar, and other unwanted game fish into the brush/tree line so they won't have to catch them again and again. The creatures of the area have free and easy meals almost daily.",
