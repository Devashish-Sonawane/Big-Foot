Nothing matched, they looked at each other, and both thought Bigfoot. She then took pictures. The prints were a left and right print of two separate individuals. They trail is hardpack but both prints were on side of trail in soft ground. Photos of the tracks:We headed up trail, found location, but tracks had been washed out in recent heavy rains. There were numerous animal tracks including deer, wolf, etc. but no more large tracks.This was an older couple who were curious about what they had found and came across as sincere and honest.",
