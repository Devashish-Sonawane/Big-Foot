            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.  She is credible.  She works as a home health care nurse in a nearby county.  She was driving from Ely to visit relatives that morning. Her husband and three children were in the car but were not looking at the road. She saw the sasquatch then mentioned it to them right after passing it.  Her husband urged her to turn the car around but the resisted and kept driving.Although skies were clear at the time of the sighting, earlier in the day there had been a heavy torrential downpour that lasted a while. She said the figure didn't seem to stand much taller than her husband who is six feet tall.  It was walking parallel to the highway in the same direction she was driving (westbound). She saw the body clearly for a few second at roughly \"two truck lengths\" from her van.  The highway is alternately marked as Hwy 1 or Hwy 169.  After looking at maps and aerial photos of the location it is clear that the dirt road connecting to highway 169 is W Boundary Road, not far past Twin Lakes Road as you head west.She was very specific about the fur coloring. It was a mix of gray and brown \"like the color of a squirrel\".I asked if there was any indication that it was actually a person in a costume rather than an animal. She said it didn't look like a costume but rather she assumed, right afterward, that it must be because it walked upright like a man but was covered with fur.As she noted in the report, the incident happened right after the start of hunting season, which may have been a factor for why the sasquatch was moving through there.On the other side of a highway there is a clear cut strip for power / phone lines. It parallels the highway. Hunters often hunt along these routes.At the time of this posting (New Years Eve 2020) there is snow on the ground in this part of Minnesota. It might be worthwhile to look around for tracks in this general area.Here is the location of the incident, approximately 5 miles west of Ely, MN:",

I have had several experiences in the fall time over several years.  Anyway, as I was walking in on a wooded hillside and happened to look down and saw an impression in a mossy patch that looked like an old sasquatch track. The ground is not good for impressions except for the mossy patches.  It measured 15 inches long. It was broad at the toes, and had a wide heel,  There was even a rise, in the middle of the track, as if  from a mid-tarsal break. It may not be a track, it may be a track. If a track, it had been there for some time, as it had small debris sitting in it.",
