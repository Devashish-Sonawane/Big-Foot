He and his family are willing to appear on camera for local media or documentary projects.The campground he mentions is the one noted on Google Maps when you search for \"Hopkins Prairie.\" It is in the southwest corner of the prairie. The campground is only open in winter months. After big rain events the \"prairie\" becomes a lake.There were four witnesses total. The bigfoot was 100 yards away. They observed it for roughly 30 seconds. The Florida Trail runs alongside the campground. There is a correlation between many sightings and major hiking trails like the Florida Trail, the Buckeye Trail, the Appalachian Trail, the Continental Divide Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail, especially where these trails are close to isolated lakes.This spring fed pond near the campground is the only clean water for miles around. This is where you should look for tracks if you decide to check out the area. ",

Well in this small ditch we saw a very unusual track for anywhere in the northeast, a five toe'd track that was HUGE!!! I took pictures, I did not have casting material, but i do have pictures with an altoids box for size comparison, we estimated this track to be between 20-22\" long and I'd say about 8-10\" wide. this was NOT, I repeat NOT like any other tracks we have seen, the track had no claw marks, I've been an avid watcher of Finding Bigfoot and do wood knocks regularly along with screams. My wife WAS NOT a believer,but after this print, she looked at me and said \"NOW I BELIEVE YOU\" this is 100% true, I took pictures of the print!!!",
