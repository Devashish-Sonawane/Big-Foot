It was freaking huge as hell. I hit the brakes looked at my mom and at the same time we both said did you see that shit and I looked back step on the gas and got up on outta there.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with both witnesses by phone. The witnesses no longer live in Louisiana. They both live in different states now. Both are credible. Both saw the same creature right after it crossed Hwy 175 at dusk. They were very certain that it was tall, lanky, shaped like a man but hairy, with long hair hanging from its arms. It happened along a part of the highway with few houses or development, but was right next to an industrial chicken farm. Joe later sent me a screen shot of a map showing where the incident occurred. To see the exact location and aerial photos just copy and paste these coordinates into Google Maps: 31.606405, -93.499096Cultural note: Joe mentioned that he is black. He mentioned that when saying that black people do not seem to report sightings. I let him know that is incorrect. It just doesn't appear that way because the race of the witness is basically never mentioned sighting reports ... apparently because witnesses don't think it is relevant to the sighting incident. True. It is not relevant ... except when considering the demographics of witnesses overall. When an investigator learns that a witness is black that fact doesn't appear in the follow up investigation either, for the same reason -- it isn't very relevant to the sighting. With that said, only a small percentage of witnesses (who submit reports) are black, so Joe is partly correct.",
