            "Observed": "I was elk hunting this past week in the Mt. Adams and Mt Saint Helens areas. I headed up on a hike on Wed. the 23rd of September at a place called Spencer Butte. It's located Outside of Cougar and is a steep hike of 1800 elevation gain (it sits about 4300 ft). My friends and I headed up the hill in the morning at about 8:30 am. The weather was very rainy.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Details:The witness called me to fill me in on the details. He explained it was the 2nd week of elk season. Rainy, cool but decent light. He estimates being within 30 feet or so of this creature. He said the Alder tree it was shaking was huge. The witness is 6'4 250lbs and couldn't shake the tree. He described the track he found as being about 3/4 of an inch or so deep. He wears a size 12 and this was a 16 or 17 and inch 1/2 wider at the ball compared to his foot. The ground was a well compacted gravel with dirt and some grass. He described the \"yowls\" they heard as being a higher pitch and definitely not human although at a distance it sounded like people talking. He noted that they did not see much of anything in the way of other wildlife or hear any. I checked and the moon phase for that day was First Quarter 49.4%Summary:I believe the witness to be credible and honest. The photo he sent of the track are quite clear. The instep is visible as are the toes which slope off on an angle and not more flat across like a bear. Also, no claw marks or distorted area within the track from a double step. ",
