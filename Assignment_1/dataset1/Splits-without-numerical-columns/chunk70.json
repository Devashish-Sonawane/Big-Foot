Though they are all self admitted amateur bigfooters, their years of experience in and out of the woods lends to them being reputable witnesses. Originally I was to meet them at the location and help look for evidence, however at the last minute the land owner did not want any locals on the property for a bigfoot excursion, so we met at another location where they interviewed me and I answered their questions the best I could. This area has had years of activity but the locals do not like to talk openly about it. There is sufficient cover, water and prey species to support a family group of bigfoots in the area.",

After 30 minutes of calling I stand up to sign the field edge and when I sign I see 2 huge glowing eyes like a yellowish bright color I\u0092ve never seen before and it was high enough off the ground my first thought was the land owners put a reflective sign in a tree. So I scope in on it and I realize whatever it was, was hiding behind a tree looking around it. So my buddy\u0092s start scoping in on it to. Then it proceeded to crouch down low to the ground and look around the other side of the tree. Then it disappeared for about 10 seconds then popped up 10 yards to the right of where it first was and it was looking around a tree again and when we all scoped in on it we all clear as day witnessed it crouch down like a person and it vanished. I\u0092ve been in the woods all of my life and seen all shorts of eye shine and tonight I seen the unexplainable.",
