            "Follow-Up Report": "On the early morning of July 10, before sunrise the family (mom, dad, adult son and grandaughter) were driving eastbound on Hwy 62 after a night of fishing on Tampa Bay. Google map image of the location:They were outside Parrish when a large, bipedal figure crossed the road about ten car lengths ahead of them, left to right. They were able to see the figure in the tail lights of the car in front of them, and their own headlights. The car immediately was filled with a horrible smell.The mom and dad in the front seat saw the figure, the passengers in the back did not, however they did smell the odor.  The car was traveling at about 70 mph and both witnesses claim it showed intelligence as it waited for the first car to pass and quickly crossed the road in 2 big steps. There were no street lights.The bigfoot was dark in color, running stiffly without any arm swing in the car\u0092s high beam lights. The dad said it had very long legs. Both witnesses spoke over each other describing odor as a strange mix of \u0093polecat, musky, swampwater and sulfur.\u0094 On the morning of the crossing, the mom called the Manatee County Sheriff\u0092s office to report it and spoke to a Deputy who admitted they have calls like this from time to time in that area.BFRO Investigator David Bakara, and myself, as well as other Florida Investigators have spoken to the couple about this incident. The mom and dad are both still very disturbed and overwhelmed about what they saw and are still trying to come to terms with the event almost a year later. The area is remote with ranches and farms spread far apart. Just North of Myakka River State Park.The mom made this drawing:BFRO David Bakara assisted in this investigation.",

It gave me a really nervous feeling. Made me jumpy feeling. I have never heard anything like it before. 2 hours later on my return trip to finish paper route. I looked around the area I had heard the sounds and saw the brush broken down on the upward bank of the hillside, like something big had climbed up the bank. Very dark at 3:30 that morning, then normal daylight.",
