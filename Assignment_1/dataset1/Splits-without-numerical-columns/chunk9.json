            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness, Kris K., at length. He is a long haul trucker, originally from Michigan but now lives outside Toronto Canada. He has driven loads down to the Nucor plant a few times. On this occassion he had changed some preferences on his Google Maps app. This caused him to be re-routed to a more \"economical\" route once he was in the vicinity of Nucor. The route took him along roads that were nearly flooded from recent heavy rains. The flood water at the edge of the road on both sides made him too nervous to stop the truck after he spotted the sasquatch.He was driving southwest on Cainhoy Road. The sasquatch was on the right side of the road, roughly 60-90 feet into woods. It was early Spring so the leaves had not grown back on the trees. He got only a brief look at the sasquatch but it was long enough to notice the fur pattern and other elements. The fur was thinner on the chest and abdomen compared to the arms and legs. The hair was was not thick (or not present at all) on the face. He described the skin color as brown-ish gray. The hair on the arms was longer and possibly matted. One arm was outstretched onto the trunk of a broken tree. The most impressive and shocking element of its appearance was its size -- its height and broad shoulders and powerful build. The observation was too brief for Kris to recall whether the saquatch was actually standing in water or rather in a spot not covered by the flood water. ",
