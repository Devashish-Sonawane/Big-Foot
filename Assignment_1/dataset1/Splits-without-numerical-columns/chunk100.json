            "Follow-Up Report": "I have talked to this witness at length several times. The family lives on 28 acres adjoining a state nature preserve northwest of Coolville. Her husband has mowed a path for her that she walks each day at the same time. She had never seen anything previously but noted that she usually sees the same animals each walk (rabbits, deer,etc) and had said to her husband that she wondered where they all were the last 3 weeks. Prior to this experience she had no opinion concerning Bigfoot and never really thought of the subject. When questioned further she once again mentioned that she had the impression that the Bigfoot was carrying a smaller animal by the way it\u0092s arms were positioned. She couldn\u0092t say with any certainty as it could have been something else. The sound the animal made was similar to \u0093Ke Kaw Kaw\u0094. She said that about a week after the sighting she noticed a return of all the normal animals. In addition, the witness and teenage daughter had walked back a couple of days later and that\u0092s when they found a possible print. When they approached the area they noticed a horrible smell and stench and the daughter believed she saw a Bigfoot watching them when they were there and asked the mother to leave.I found this witness compelling and believable. I have taken several reports in the general area. It\u0092s below the glaciated line in Southeastern Ohio. Many fields in the creek and river bottoms filled with rich soil. The hills are hardwood that in places is remote and unpopulated. I speculate that she showed up at a time walking that was unusual for her and caught the Bigfoot off guard. I also believe that they had been in the area for about 3 weeks or so, as evidenced by game being gone, and moved on about a week after the sighting. It\u0092s common for Bigfoot to vary in color and there have been several reports of varying eye color. I have included pictures of where the sighting occurred, where their land adjoins the preserve. I also have included the picture of the reported footprint. While interesting, it\u0092s inconclusive. The track is compelling due to the story surrounding how it came to be found. Like about 60% of all Bigfoot sightings this one occurred during the daylight. This photo above shows the location where the sighting occurred, from the position where it was seen. The red annotation shows where it was standing. Again, this is NOT a photo of a bigfoot, but no matter how much that is emphasized some idiots will still complain that they don't see the bigfoot in the photo ...  Oh well.See report above from info about this track photo.",
