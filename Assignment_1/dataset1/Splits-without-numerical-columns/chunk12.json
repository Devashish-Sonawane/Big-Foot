            "Follow-Up Report": "There were two witnesses. They live in Niceville, Florida. I spoke with the wife. They were hunting white-tailed deer in the Jackson South portion of Eglin Air Force Base on a slope above Pinelog Creek (see maps below).They were wearing hunter-orange vests sitting and facing each other when they heard a big crunch, like something large stepping on brush. Her husband thought it was a buck before it came into view 60-80 yards away. She saw his face react as if seeing something frightening. He grabbed her shirt and directed her attention behind her, in the direction of the sound. They both saw the figure as it was looking at them. She said it was dark brown in color, not black, and seemed to stand over 7 feet tall on two legs. It was shaped like a man but covered with hair. The couple turned to look toward each other briefly. That is when the figure stepped out of their view.  They continued to sit quietly, though scared. Several minutes later they heard another crunch in a different direction. They saw it again briefly as it was heading toward the creek bottom where the brush is thicker.Before the couple left the area they saw two does (female deer) approach them in a hurry as if fleeing from something.Here is the location on Eglin Air Force Base:",

I responded that I've never heard anything like it and initially said a howler monkey escaped from the zoo. It was long increasing howls that were felt as well as heard and had a tone and character almost primal in nature. They continued for 10 minutes at 2 to 3 minute intervals lasting 10 seconds I'm guessing.",

They arrived late to their camp site and set up hammocks. They got a fire going, heard owls, a raven and the sound of the creek they were camping next to. That night around 3 a.m. they were awoken by a loud howl and described it as something you could feel in your body. After the initial howl that woke them up, they heard three more that night. They were all coming from the same direction, up the creek from their site. He said it was difficult to judge the distance but could have been between 100 to 500 yards or more away. When they awoke it was pitch black, a clear night with no noticeable moon, they could see the stars through the top of the trees and their fire had burned down from earlier. They heard it clearly, even over the ambient noise from the creek. The four howls varied in duration, but the pitch and tone remained the same. They're both experienced outdoorspeople and have been camping in Grizzly country. Although they couldn't identify it as any animal they ever heard before, they didn't feel scared. \"I didn't feel as if we were going to get killed.\"When they were first awoken she said, \"What is that,\" to which he replied, \"I was going to ask you.\" Neither had heard anything like that before. Not an owl. He's hunted bear before and heard \"bear death moans\" and those sound like something a person can make. This was not.After the sounds stopped she went to sleep pretty quickly and he stayed up for a while and rebuilt the fire. They are both critical thinkers and looked-up all kinds of vocalizations online for other animals and they identified it as a Sasquatch vocalization once they heard one that sounded exactly like what they'd heard. \"I don't know what I heard, but I've never heard anything like it.\" His wife had never heard anything like that either. His brain couldn't deduct and find a logical explanation for it. He said he'd \"absolutely\" want to experience it again out of curiosity. Didn't feel like they were in danger but psychologically a little thrown off. Although they were thrown off by the experience, they described feeling \"different\" about the location, \"not scared, but different.\" They're both comfortable in the woods and he said he'd love to hear it again.T.S. seemed to be a very credible whiteness and was able to give great detail about their evening and their search for alternative explanations. This cannot be ruled out as Sasquatch vocalizations.",
