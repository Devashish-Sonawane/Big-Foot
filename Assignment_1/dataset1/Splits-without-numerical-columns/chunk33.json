It's not uncommon to see turkeys, hogs and occasional deer. The pasture land has cows on it from time to time. When this sighting happened there were no cows around.",

The weather was still overcast and drizzling. The three family members were traveling North on Hwy 653 by car towards Thompson Nursery Road, just after noon on August 2, 2017. On the left side of the road all three noticed a large human figure in a swampy area about 75 yards away as they passed it. The mom turned the car around but the figure was gone when they drove by again. They insist it was not a cow or tree, but a large human figure.They described it as a human-like figure that was dull brown in color, similar to a \u0093brown palm frond.\u0094 It was mid-waist in the water and had its arms out of the water. The arms appeared to have something hanging from them. It was standing still and its head was looking down. The torso was large, and they couldn\u0092t see the legs. The head seemed oblong, conical. The area is a cow pasture and very rural. There are orange groves and farms nearby. Railroad tracks and a powerline road run along the back side of the location sighting.Google earth image of the location:",

Early this morning, probably about 2 am, several of the scouts and their parents were awoken by a series of what they described as whoops.  My wife described three whoops as being VERY close and a short time later, maybe a few minutes, another series of whoops farther away as if the animal was moving away. She said it was unnerving to the point that she wasn't going to leave the tent the rest of the night.  She described the sound as nothing she has ever heard before.  Many of the parents and boys that heard the sounds were discussing it this morning and the possibility that it was a sasquatch did come up.",
