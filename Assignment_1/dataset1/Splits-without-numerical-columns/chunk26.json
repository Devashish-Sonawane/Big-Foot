            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness at his home in a suburban neighborhood that overlooks the west end of Grapevine Lake. He stated, that while standing in his front yard prior to going to work at 3:40 am, he heard 3 powerful wood knocks coming from Corp of Engineer land across the street and behind his neighbor's property. After the first 3 knocks, he heard another single very loud knock, and then two sets of 3 distant knocks coming from deeper in the woods closer to the lake. He then immediately walked over to his neighbor\u0092s parking area to look for activity in the woods in the area from where he heard the knocks, but saw and heard nothing in the morning dark. He commented on how totally silent everything was.After recreating the scene of his experience, we explored the area from which he believed the knocks originated. Although the area was cut with bike trails, it was very hilly and wooded and descended into a creek emptying into Grapevine Lake. His neighbor\u0092s home was about 100 yards away from the presumed site of the knocks. Just off the trail, we found a nearly new, 3 foot long, 4 by 4 inch piece of construction wood. It looked totally out of place where we found it and had evidence of compression marks and cracking. I checked it for hairs and skin but found nothing. We both believed it was possible that this wood was used to make the knocks. If it was used, I could not find evidence of what it had struck to make the knocks. See photos:Two days after I had met with him, the witness called to tell me that he had found what appeared to be a footprint just off the trail past the area we searched. He sent photos of what he saw:I suggested that he might cast the footprint; but when he went back the next day, he said that the print area had degraded significantly and a cast would not be feasible.I found the witness to be very credible and truly surprised at what he had heard. Because of other reports around this area and the evidence found, I believe his encounter has significant merit.",

The next night my husband heard loud what he said sounded like tree knocks. That same night, I was in our travel trailer alone in bed when I heard a voice outside the window. Nobody was around and then the trailer started moving. No wind or anything organic to make it move.  We live across the road from a clear cut logging area and there is woods all around, we live on a lake and have a creek running through the property.",
