            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on the afternoon of 6/15/16 about his encounter. While there is no way to tell for sure whether or not the tree knocks were from a Bigfoot, there are other parts to this story that make me believe it likely was.First, there is report on another website that describes a Class A encounter on the same day, made by an unrelated person, about an hour later, just a mile or so from this encounter. While I was not involved in the investigation from the other site, it reads as credible.Second, this report was from an area just a mile or so from the site of the BFRO Texas Expedition October 2015. One whole team of participants on that Expedition had a Class A sighting very near to where this event occurred. In short, there has been a lot of reported activity in this part of the forest.Lastly, unlike some areas, wood knocks are very common in East Texas forests. Heard and reported all the time, signs point to wood knocks as being a communication tool used by Bigfoots - perhaps because the forests of SE Texas are relatively flat and the wood knock sound travels farther. The witness intends to continue hiking in the same forest and promises to update us on any further observations. ",
