            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with David for over an hour, and have had numerous email and text communications. I found him to be very down to earth and matter of fact in his demeanor and sharing of the event. He lives \"off the grid\". Using a portable generator, solar, well water and similar other types of self sufficient means, he lives in a camper on raw land as he awaits the building of his cabin. The evening of his event was a quarter moon and comfortably temperate. He was relaxing and enjoying the natural sounds of the woods when it suddenly got dead quiet after he heard a \"tree knock\". This came from the next door neighbors property, or close to it. He was listening intently when he heard a \"shuffling type of gait\" on a gravel path with bi pedal steps. He timed it at 2.5 seconds (est) between steps for \"a half dozen or less steps\". It also sounded like there was \"something being dragged along\" as it was walking. He also noted what sounded like \"something leaning, pushing\" or perhaps trying to enter a storage shed on the neighbor's property. By this time he was out of bed and trying to see out his window, but it was too dark. The general rustling, movement and eerie quiet went on for about an hour. His cat then went to the small window by his bunk when it \"began hissing and freaking out\" and a moment later he heard the lid close on his bait bed. (He has an old rusted out BBQ grill he uses as a bait bed, full of potting soil and worms). This is just a few feet from his camper. Photos of the bait bed (rocks placed on top by David):This was when he had a sense of dread and the thought crossed his mind he might be in danger. I assured him that this was not the case in general. After a couple of hours of intermittent activity, he heard a \"whoop\" and then the forest around him came back to life.He did take photos of the print:He also noted that \"someone\" had \"smashed in\" a case of eggs left out on his neighbors porch. It looked like \"someone had put their fist through the case and grabbed a handful of eggs\". Photos of the eggs:He felt, during the entire time of the event, that there was \"someone or some thing\" out foraging on his property. Since he had studied the BF subject closely, and during the activity, whoops and knocks, etc., he was fairly certain of the source of the activity, in his opinion. I believe his story as told, and as a side note, when a grown man, or person of the woods, tells you they were terrified, it tends to add credence, in my humble opinion. It takes a lot of courage to admit to a perfect stranger that you are afraid of something in the night. This report has the mostly typical earmarks of a classic Class B event, in my opinion.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke at length with this witness. He has nearly 40 years in military and law enforcement service, and his powers of observation are at, or above what you would expect from a trained observer. He also has a degree in Anthropology and is a self described expert in Darwinism, and has also studied quantum physics and math. The event is as follows:Witness, and his wife and 12 year-old were driving in the Ouachita National Forest around dusk, 5:10 pm to be exact. He had been joking a few minutes before that if Sasquatch really exists, this forest would be the perfect habitat. Since they were aware of his incident as a police officer, his child and wife were both looking to either side of the highway, just in case there would be a chance sighting. He saw it first at a distance of about 400 feet when he said something to his wife and daughter. He was closing in at about 80 feet per second since he was going 55 mph. They were both still looking out the respective sides of the vehicle, looking in the woods. They both turned in time to see \"something\", but their observation was \"less than a second\". His entire view was 3-4 seconds tops. They were driving south and the creature was going west to east. Description was black or dark brown, at least 8ft tall, and \"nearly as wide as a deer is long\", no less than 4ft width at the shoulders. It crossed the 25 ft road in three steps. It was first just standing at the crest of a small hill, and \"it could see traffic coming from both directions\". In his assessment, it had chosen to cross the road at this hill so it could see what was coming. His words and opinion. He stopped the car where it had disappeared into the woods and saw nothing but very rocky terrain that dropped 16-20 feet very sharply, and then heavy woods beyond that.It was mentioned earlier in this report that he had had a sighting, when he was a police officer in Louisiana, in 1970. He and his partner responded to a prowler call, and long story made short, they chased it for 2 city blocks before it disappeared into the canals and marshes. See Report #56017. Although he had a degree in anthropology at that time, he had no knowledge or belief system in Sasquatch. Once he answered that prowler call, there was no mistaking what he saw, along with his partner. He knew what it was and has been a believer ever since, though he has not gone out of his way to follow the subject until recently.",
