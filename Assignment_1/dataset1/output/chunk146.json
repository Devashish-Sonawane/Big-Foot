            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with this very credible, articulate witness, these details can be added:\u0095 The creature they saw was approximately 8ft tall and weighed 350lbs or more. It was muscular and \u0093filled-out\u0094.\u0095 He described it as having a gorilla-like neck that was thick and muscular. When it turned to look at them over its right shoulder, it had to twist its torso. Its shoulder width was approximately 3 \u00bd feet wide. Its proportions were man-like with the exception of the arms, which were longer, and the torso which appeared to be longer than the legs.  No facial features were seen.\u0095 The odor was described as a strong musky, dirty hair smell, like nothing he\u0092s ever smelled before.\u0095 After detecting them, it moved away quickly; breaking tree limbs and being aggressively noisy upon reaching the tree line. An entirely different demeanor was displayed from its earlier soft padded approach.   \u0095 This sighting location is within miles of the Kenwood Reserve area which is an area of Delaware County that is 6 miles north and south and 12 miles east and west, which is held in trust for the Cherokee Nation by the US government. It is bordered by 10,000 plus acres of City of Tulsa land, and just south of Lake Eucha is the 14,316 acre Spavinaw Wildlife Management Area.Also of note: The witness reported there was a huge wave of sightings in 1974 in the Jay and Kenwood areas of the county.
