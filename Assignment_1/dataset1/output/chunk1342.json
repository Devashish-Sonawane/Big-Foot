            "Observed": "I moved to this location in New Hampshire  in 2001. I have had several sightings over the past few years. Usually from my living room while I am watching television. I know this sounds weird. But, I am serious. My couch sits facing my picture window. Beyond the picture window, there is a small creek and an empty wooded lot. I have seen deer, bear, turkey, racoons, moose and fox on my property.  It is in a part of Gilford called Gunstock Acres. It usually happens in the late evening on a dark summer night. No paticular date or time. From the ground to the top of the window has got to be at least 10 feet tall. This creature is about 9 feet in height. Dark deep brownish long hair, and walks upright, similar to a human. I have seen it go one direction, then go past the window in the other direction several minutes later, or it just walks away until the next time I see it, which has been about once a year. I have seen it looking more like a shadow when my lights in the house are on. I am usually caught off guard, and am startled when I've seen it, in disbelief, but there is no other explanation.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "     I contacted the report writer and immediately received a long, detailed message back with further aspects of the situation filled in. I then visited the residence on June 27/28, 2009, spent four hours with Mr. and Mrs. J., exploring in the woods near them, at the base of Gunstock Mountain.  We came across a good number of tree twists and some potential tracks, but none good enough to cast.  We found a deer rib hanging in a tree.        I stayed the night in a spare room, and set up the thermal camera aimed at the tree line where the family has been leaving food for the past eight years.  In the morning, the food was gone, but the footage revealed raccoons and a fox as the culprits that night.        Three members of the family (the mother, her twenty-two-year-old son, and eighteen-year-old daughter) told me in detail about their sightings.  A total of five times, they have seen a Sasquatch either walking past the living room windows or (in one case) just looking in.  The mother has also seen one, on a moonlit night, in the woods behind and above their house, swaying back and forth behind a tree.  She showed me this tree and it is approximately seventy-five feet from their kitchen window.  When I showed them the Mike Greene thermal footage, she said that that swaying behavior was the exact same that she witnessed.        The daughter has heard the Ohio Howl several times, both close by and at a distance.  She also saw a large-eyed, partially hair-covered face at the living room window one night, and when I asked her, \"Did you lock eyes with it fascinated, or run into your room and throw the covers over your head?\", she answered, \"The second.\"         I found all members of the family credible and sincere and their residence, so close to uninterrupted, mountainous territory, conducive to such visitations.
