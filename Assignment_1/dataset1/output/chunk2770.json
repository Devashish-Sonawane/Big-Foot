            "Observed": "Back in 2004 my boyfriend and I were driving around at night. We were near Murdock Kansas on a dirt road when we seen something running up along the fence line. It was grayish white and about 8 ft tall. I turned the car around to see if it was still there and it was gone. I have always joked that it was bigfoot never knowing that there had been sightings in Kansas.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness via phone. This creature was greyish white at between 7-8 ft. tall. She estimated the weight to be between 300-350 lbs. Physical description was based on her husband and son, who are 6-2 and 6-4 respectively. This creature dwarfed them in height and weight. Gender was not noted. She came around a curve and the creature was on her side, running parallel with the road. The creature was not more than 15-20 feet from her window. The moon was full and the area was well lit by the moon, though it was a dark country road otherwise. She asked her boyfriend (now husband) what it was and he said he had no idea. She turned the car around and went back and it was gone. Entire sighting lasted 10-12 seconds. There was a fence line along where it was running so it would have had to hop the fence. She had told several people and they all thought she was crazy. She is steadfast in her belief as to what she saw. This creature bears an eerie resemblance to the creature in my published report #35828, and the locations are within 20-25 miles of one another. And there is another report out of the same area, report #35984. Though the date of her sighting is 8 years previous to #35828, the odds of a similar creature (grey and white) running around are pretty high against there being 2 creatures of similar coloring. On Dec. 25th, 2012, witness emailed me and added that there were also big rounded hay bales along the road/fence line, and that they were over 6 ft. tall. This helped her determine the height of the creature as well as the height of boyfriend and son.",
