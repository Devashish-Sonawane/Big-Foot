            "Follow-Up Report": "Darrell Trimm, age 35, states that he and his brother, Jeff, age 33, were at Onion Lake Campground looking for evidence of Bigfoot because of all the reports and lore that have been reported in this area. I have a similar expereince with deer coming into camp near the start of hunting season in an area that is not anywhere near a developed campground. These deer would look away from camp and appeared to be looking for something more than they watched us. Darrell states that he thought the deer had stayed around their camp because of the perceived protection that it would offer rather than whatever was making the noise out in the woods. They did try to record the sounds with a tape recorder, but were unsuccessful due to the ineffective microphone. Later that day no footprints were found, although they did see elk tracks earlier at a lower elevation. This is a classic report that follows the same m.o. of other reports: unknown creatures calling back and forth to each other, wild animals seeking protection near humans, event happened at night which suggest a nocturnal animal(s). Report 9548 is the virtually the same since Jeff Trimm logged his report and impressions.",

Use a topographic map and find the ridge line between both rivers this is where all the elk and big game head when pressured.  You'll need to hike through the dry pine first but as soon as you get above that you'll find one of the most secluded square miles of Adams with small grass fields, downed old growth, and water.  With the extreme dry climate this year this is where all the animals were at or in the lower swampy lands.  and basically a place where an animal could live with almost no interference with man.  Note also you'll need to leave early in the morning for good wind conditions after 10 the wind changes every 5 minutes.  If these creatures are so elusive they have to have a nose on them that could smell dirty socks miles away.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the Witness over the phone. The Witness and his two friends, who were there too, are archery hunters.  They know where the elk and deer go when pressured.  They were at one of these places when they ran across the track. The track was very clearly not a bear.  The Witness knows bear tracks from his long hunting experience both in Washington State and in Alaska. The track was one foot away from the creek, with the toes pointing towards the water. The area is mostly covered with river rock, with very little sandy area.  The creature was probably walking across the rocks, and then stepped next to the creek and then on across.  The track appeared to be about one week old.The track was about 11 inches long, but very wide.  It had very distinct toes with a much larger big toe.  He said the track was mostly flat footed, but that there was a small arch. There were no indications of claws, which would have been visible in the sand had it been a bear.  He said that they video taped it, but then someone taped over that footage by mistake.  I believe that the Witness and his friends found a sasquatch track.  The short length is unusual, but tracks like this one have been seen before by investigators in the Cascades. ",
