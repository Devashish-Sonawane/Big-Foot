            "Follow-Up Report": "A field investigation was conducted at the site on Saturday evening, August 18.  The results were negative.  No tracks or sign were found, and no sounds or anything unusual were heard around a campfire up until 10:30 pm when the site was vacated.I visited the family in their home in New Mexico a week later on August 25.  I spent almost 1 1/2 hours with them, discussing their experience and inspecting the trailer.  There were still observable signs on it, though much had faded or washed away since the occurance almost 3 weeks previous.Some of the sign or \"handprints\" were above the window where the sister had observed the \"black mat\" against the window in the middle of the night.  Also, at the back of the trailer, which angled away from the perpendicular toward the top (which was 8 feet high from the ground on the sides), was one of the mud smearings.  I am 6'2\" and the tips of my fingers fell 12\" short when I stretched up to try to reach the spot.   On the opposite side of the trailer, there was still a definable print of what appeared to be the right hand of a primate.  The right edge of the hand was discernable, and 12 1/2 inches up from the heel were the fingertips.  I would guess the fingers were curled at the time because it seems the creature was \"feeling out\" the trailer in the night.  The occupants heard what sounded like fingernails being scraped over the sheet-metal.  A tarp was tied down over the un-weatherproofed top with bungy cords.  Twice a cord at the rear corner of the trailer was 'twanged' during the night-time experience. The witness is very intrigued by the BF mystery, especially since seeing one at close range in Texas when she was a teenager.  She is anxious to return to the site.  I noted, however, that her husband stated he would just as soon not go back.  She wants to try to return sometime in September even though big game archery and muzzle-loading seasons are underway, and human activity will be much increased compared to when they visited in August. In summary, it is a very intriging experience reported by the witnesses.  I am convinced they were visited by what appears to be a bigfoot-like creature.  And, in case you're wondering - no photographs of the sign on the trailer were attempted because they could only be seen during my visit at certain angles of the light.  I do not believe photographic efforts would have produced any distinguishable results.",
