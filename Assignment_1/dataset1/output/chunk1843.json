            "Observed": "This is an older reporting. It was late spring or early summer of 2005. Located just 5-10 minutes south of Traverse City off a dirt road few miles off of Garfield rd. I was meeting up with a group of friends of mine on some Private property back in the woods. I was walking down a gated dirt road to meet with them in a spot we had found the summer before off of Arbutis lake. There we had come across previously while wondering through the woods was a hill that over looked the lake. You walked down the sandy bank that had erosion and you are at the waters edge, about 25 feet down. Any ways, i had just gotten out of work and it was around 5 or 6 o'clock pm and i had parked my car at the gate because it was locked. i continued to walk down the road. after about 10 minutes of walking i started to hear what sounded like sticks being banged together. knowing the camp site was relatively close, i thought it could have been my friends i was meeting up with getting fire wood, \"hey guys!\" i yelled out. no response, just the sound continuing, not skipping a sound... bang, bang about every second or so. \"hey you!\" i yelled thinking maybe its not them, but maybe some one else, still no response.. the sound continued. after my mind started wondering what it could have been, and knowing there was no houses for a decent walk away or so.. i decided i was going to just get out of there knowing i was alone. i quickly ran the last mile to the camp site. i stopped running once i approached the site, didn't want my friends to think i was scared in the woods by myself, i walked the last few hundred yards to the site. i didnt say anything to them about what had happened because they would have just thought i was joking. figured i would just let it sit, and do what i could so i wouldnt have to walk back to my car later alone.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I found this report interesting because the encounter happened close to home and I have researched this area a little bit recently. This is a beautiful area of extensive hard wood and pine forest around a lake. There is very little development in this area and it is close to a year-long open water source. I talked with the witness for quite a while.  He is currently serving in the Coast Guard.  Mr. K shared his experience with me at length.  He stated that when he arrived at the site, he had quite a distance to walk alone to reach camp and the entire time he felt uneasy. When he heard the wood knocks, Mr. K stated that he thought the knocks were done by one of his friends, messing around with him.   Mr. K also shared that when the sticks were thrown, he and his friend were surprised that the sticks landed right between the two of them.  They thought the sticks might had fallen out of a tree, but as he talked with his friend about it, they couldn't see how two sticks could come flying through the air and land right between them if they fell from a tree.  When asked if it was windy, he said, \"No, it was really calm.\"  He also added that the tent they had set up had been tampered with while they were away from camp.  He said that the fork support for the two man tent was bent sometime during their visit to the lake to see the crayfish.   Mr. K also talked about \"feeling uneasy\" throughout their stay at the camp that evening.  Rather than spending the night, they all left camp later that evening, feeling afraid all the way back to their cars.  Mr. K shared that he is an avid outdoors man and he is usually very comfortable in the woods.  It was an unusual experience for him to feel afraid in this type of setting. ",
