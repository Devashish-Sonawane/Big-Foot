            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone, and he seemed sincere. He was careful not to fill in blanks and genuinely unnerved at what he saw. He was headed to work at his usual time of 6 am. It was still dark so he had his headlights on. Appx. 1.5 miles from home, he noticed a large shape on the right side of the road coming into view. It was about 500 ft ahead and standing on two legs. He emphasized this animal was not hunched over. It was looking to the other side, as if contemplating whether to cross or not. It never looked directly at him. As he approached the animal, he was slowing almost to a complete stop. Just 30ft from where it stood, it decided to cross, took three large steps, and was across the two lane road. He said it looked like a fully erect gorilla with longer arms and a more human shaped (round) head. Its hair color was dark brown with some gray, its skin around the face was leathery, and it was at the very least 7 ft tall. His surprise at seeing this creature was compounded by the fact he believes he had seen it before, 25 years ago.. Except it was a little thicker and not as gray. The witness related this story to me, but only if I promised to keep the other participants identities vague and the location a secret. When he was 12 years old, he was hunting with two family members on a mountain not too far from his house. They were coon hunting with 3 seasoned dogs. All of these dogs were fierce and 1 especially (a blue tick), was afraid of nothing. They were sitting on the bed of the truck in a small clearing. It was around 3 am on a clear night with plenty of moonlight.  The dogs were running in the woods and would bay when they tree'd a raccoon. As they sat there talking, the dogs began to bark and cry.  The men could hear them running toward the truck. The dogs broke out of the tree line about 200 feet away, came over a small rise and were making a dead run for the truck. They never slowed down and jumped right into the arms of the hunters and cowered into the very front of the bed. The men could hear something else coming. It was making a lot of noise with screams and grunts. It also broke out of the woods, and they could see it come over the same rise. It was shaped like a huge man, but looked exactly like a silverback gorilla with longer arms and legs. It stood erect and was chasing the dogs. The witness said it  seemed ticked off. It never slowed down either and was headed straight for the truck. One family member grabbed the young witness by his collar and yanked him back into the truck bed while the oldest lept for the drivers seat. They sped out as the creature came within 10 feet of the truck. When they got home, they excitedly recounted the details and reluctantly agreed to go back in the morning. They got little sleep that night, and returned the next day to look for any evidence of the creature. Upon arriving at the site, they saw clear footprints of where the creature had crossed the clearing and approached the truck. The oldest witness did not like this, grabbed a branch and scratched out all the visible tracks. He then told the other two (including our original witness) to NEVER speak of this. Both never did, until this retelling. One of the 3 witnesses has since passed on, the other will not speak about it. I sent the witness the link to Pete Travers' Painted Cave website and asked him to pick one of the sketches out that most resembled what he saw:",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness reported that the vocalization event took place between 10:30PM and midnight on a clear, moonlit and still summer night. He was very familiar with the area, having fished there numerous times since his youth. The witness traversed a recently cut hay field and walked down a footpath through a small patch of woods.  He then walked a short distance (50-75 yards) across hard mud flats to the edge of a receding pond with a man-made dam at one end.After fishing for approximately one hour, the witness reported hearing a very sudden, loud and low two second guttural half grunt, twice in succession, followed by a ten second pause, and an then an identical sound twice more in succession.  The sound originated from the same area at the edge of the woods that he had exited from about one hour earlier. Despite excellent visibility in the moonlit night, the witness did not report seeing or hearing any movement immediately prior to the incident from the direction that the sound came from.No unusual smells were noticed.  Deer were observed in the general area on the trip into the site and marsh birds are also known to inhabit this wildlife management site.  The witness is an avid outdoorsman and was confident that the sounds he heard were not those of a loud marsh bird like a Black-crowned Night Heron.The area has remained much as it was at the time of the incident; however, the dam has since been rebuilt to help maintain the pond at a more uniform depth and size.This report was investigated by D.A. Brake, PhD, a research immunologist and microbiologist residing in CT.",
