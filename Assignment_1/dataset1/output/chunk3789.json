And I saw a creature running that was at least 8 or 9 feet tall.  It had very shaggy like hair. At first I thought that I was seeing things. There was a very bad stench in the air. It was a smell that I couldn't even discribe to you. It was running parallel side of the car for a few seconds, then it vered off into the woods. There was no way that it could have been anything else. I have never seen anything like it before. I stopped the car to see if I could see it again. I looked into the woods and it was a human like creature with long shaggy hair that was abnormally tall. It is so hard to describe, to put into words. I went home and told my parents what I had seen and to this day they don't believe me. But, my husband does.",
