The San Luis Rey River cuts through a narrow barranca that is concealed by vegetation, steep walls, and a tree canopy.The sighting lasted no more than ten seconds - the animal took off as soon as the witness turned around to look.  It moved up the side of the barranca quickly and quietly \"like a ghost\" and left behind a human-like stool.  The witness heard no sound and smelled no odor, and he found no tracks on the dry, sandy path.At the time, the twenty-two year old witness was in the Navy, stationed in San Diego, and had ten years of hunting experience.  He had camped at this location several times before.  On this hike he carried a field knife and a walking stick.Over the years there have been a number of sightings in this area which includes Palomar Mountain, Cleveland National Forest, and a number of Indian reservations.",
