He had to climb up and get him out of the stand. He only said that he had seen something come out of the woods on four legs.

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness, John on Thursday, May 25, 2000, over the phone regarding his 1997 sighting in Cass County, Texas. The following are comments and observations from that interview that augment his written report:1. The cry they heard was unlike anything John had heard before or since, including panther cries, which are heard periodically. It was both deep and high-pitched, and wavered in its tone.2. They observed \"smashed limbs\". These were both branches on larger trees and smaller trees broken off at the 5-8 foot level. Some of these smaller trees were ripped from the ground.These were observed in several locations during the day before the sighting in the area surrounding their campsite.3. The behavior of the subject creature around their camp was that of a sequence of noises - crashing movement to subtle movement in an encircling pattern around the camp.4. The creature observed was tall, but specific details couldn't be seen. It just watched the witnesses for a short period, but did not make any other visible movements. When it leaned out and then moved back, it moved similar to the way a man would move, not bear-like. The distance may also have been shorter than the 100 yards in his report, but facial and body details were not fully visible. 5. I asked him about unusual wildlife or climatic conditions at the time of the 1997 sighting. He indicated it was very dry. In fact, that year marked the beginning of drought and drought-like conditions for much of north and east Texas that continue today. Also, at the time of his sighting, a lot of the smaller wildlife was not visible in those woods where the sighting took place. He had and has hunted the area and thought that unusual. 6. He remarked that as he had submitted his sighting, his wife told him about a sighting she and her mother had a number of years ago. In that event, the two women saw both an adult and a juvenile \"bigfoot\" cross the field and road in front of them. The creatures stopped briefly to look at the women, then moved into the woods. The witness' wife's mother said those were the \"wild people\". He also mentioned that he has heard numerous reports of such creatures being seen near Douglassville (those residents refer to the creature sometimes as the \"Woolly Booger\") - 10 miles from this sighting area. As a additional point, this area of his sighting is in the extreme northeast Texas area, 30 miles from both Texarkana and from Fouke, Arkansas. This area has been a location of such sightings for years. ",
