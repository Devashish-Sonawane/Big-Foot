I was heading up a small feeder creek (Don't know if it has a name) trying to find the headwaters. Just exploring. I was about an hour from my campsite when I noticed a \"dead animal\" smell that was very strong. I didn't think too much about it, but it did stink. I kept on moving up the creek for about 10 minutes? before I heard something moving through the brush on my side of the creek directly in front of me. I couldn't see it at first but it seemed to be coming in my direction.",
