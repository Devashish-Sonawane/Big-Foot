            "Observed": "Two years ago, I went with my Uncle to stay at a cabin in Mammoth Lakes to hike, fish, and just enjoy the nature.  We had a cabin right on the border of Lake Mary and he had brought his two sheep dogs with him to the cabin. Every night he and I would take turns taking the dogs out for a walk. We would bring a flash light with us each time we went out to walk the dogs.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "In my opinion, R.T.\u0092s experience that night in July of 2005 has some of the ear marks of a Sasquatch encounter, like the creatures swaying back and forth, breaking of branches, its size, and the actions of the dogs he had under tow. He also stated it looked like a very tall ape, but built like a human, and after what seemed like minuets it just turned and walked away. Several years ago our (my) family visited the Horseshoe Lake area to see how the poisonous gases from the ongoing thermal and earth quake activity have devastated a large section of the pine trees and the brush on the North side of this lake which is located about a mile north of Lake Mary. Before that, during the 1960\u0092s, we use to trout fish most of these lakes and streams in and around the Mammoth area.On September 25, 2007 I got to talk with R.T. who is a young man who is still very much impressed and mesmerized about what was seen on that summer night while taking his dogs on a walk outside of his uncle\u0092s cabin in the Mammoth area of California. The witness said that this creature was almost a 100 yards way from him and his dogs and it was a little up hill from his position. The reason that he turned on his flash light was the fact that the two large dogs he had under tow were pulling, barking and growling, while pulling towards the area where the creature was standing and swaying while watching them. When he turned on that flash light he noticed this very large creature for about 2 minutes until it turned and walked away from him breaking limbs and sticks as it moved away.  The area smelled of dead fish which was really strong and he now figures it was probably eating the fish that comes out of the lakes and rivers in that area. He also stated that this creature had to be between 8\u0092 and 10\u0092 tall, and weighed somewhere around 600 to 800 lbs. the shoulders were really large something like a human football player would look like with shoulder pads. R.T. stated that the top part of the creature was just huge including its head.  While the flash light was on the creature he thought the color might have been a real dark brown or black. He also thinks that he was watching it breathing while it was standing there swaying. He didn\u0092t hear it, but he thought it was a heavy type of breathing like the chest was moving in and out. In my opinion, this witness was probably a little closer to this creature than he estimated. My reasons for this are watching it breathe, the smell and hearing the sticks and branches brake as it moved off. No, this young man never went to where the creature was standing to check for prints.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On September 9, 2014 the BFRO received the following voice mail: \u0093voicemail#47021\"I returned her phone call, and was able to speak to her for several minutes. Her sighting was very recent and I could hear in her voice the eagerness to tell me what she had witnessed. On the night of September 9, 2014 she was driving from Sarasota east on Hwy 72 towards Arcadia around 8:30pm. The sun had set that night at 7:21 p.m., so it was still twilight. Hwy 72 in this area is an undivided two-lane road. It has no street lights and passes through Myakka River State Park, woods and swamps.  Google Earth image of the area:View Larger MapJust after crossing over Horse Creek she caught moment to the right (south) of the road. She started to slow down because she caught a glimpse of a deer. As the car got closer she no longer saw the deer, but a bigfoot. The bigfoot was not \u0093deer colored\u0094 which was what she initially noticed when she first slowed down, but black, bipedal and much larger. She is not sure where the deer ran to, but the bigfoot took her attention and proceeded to cross the road in front of her. The bigfoot turned and looked at her as it ran less than 15 feet in front of her car and crossed in a 2 step-like \u0093leap\u0094, moving right to left. It seemed to duck into the scrub once it was across. If she had not stepped hard on the brakes, she felt she would have hit it. She said that the bigfoot seemed to run in front of her purposely, as if it were playing \u0093chicken.\u0094 She did not see the deer again, stating that it was a completely different color, shape and size than the bigfoot and she had no doubt that she saw that too.She described the bigfoot as having black shaggy hair. She emphasized, \u0093shaggy, not fluffy. It was like a dog.\u0094 She told me it was \u0093huge!\u0094 And a comment she made several times was, \u0093I can\u0092t figure out how they stay hidden when they are so huge!\u0094I asked her how tall she thought it was and she admitted not being good at guessing but her father is 6\u00925\u0094 and it was much taller than him. She described the shoulders as being, \u0093as wide as my mama\u0092s dodge!\u0094 She described the face as very human looking with tan colored, leathery looking skin, a flat wide nose and dark eyes. She drove 20 yards or so past it and pulled off the road. She got out of her car, she heard nothing but smelled a musky odor. She called several of her children to tell them what she had just witnessed.Several days later I met her at her home, met her children. Her son commented how she had called them that night telling him what she had seen. I questioned her on getting out of the car. I have never spoken to a witness that had showed such courage. She said she didn't think about it and didn't feel fear immediately; she was just so shocked to have seen something that \"wasn't real,\" she just didn't consider danger until a few moments later when she looked down and noticed a stick that could have been a snake. She admitted to being frightened of snakes and that is what made her realize she should leave. She admitted that after thinking about it, apprehensiveness set in and she had not driven that road since. She was a bit nervous to return with me.I brought a book with pictures of dog breeds as she couldn't think of the type of dog that had the similar fur. She looked through the book and pointed to a Golden Retriever. \u0093The fur was like this, this length, but black,\u0094 she said. See photo:The witness and I then drove to the location. She repeated her encounter to me. She reiterated that it really seemed to her as if the bigfoot purposely leaped in front of her, when it didn\u0092t have to.  As we drove to the location, she repeatedly stated that it was \u0093huge.\u0094 She claimed to know it was a bigfoot the moment she saw it. She admitted not believing they were real creatures prior to seeing it. She admitted to not knowing very much about sasquatch and asked more questions than any witness I have interviewed.At the location I took these photos: Looking east on Hwy. 72 -Looking west on Hwy. 72 - There are cow pastures and an orange grove in the immediate area.  There have been many sightings around the Myakka area. See Report #39014 and Report #8561.In March 2013 this \"Myakka Skunk Ape\" YouTube video was taken inside the park. It shows a dark bipedal figure running in the field.Thank you to Michigan Investigator Jim Sherman for his assistance, allowing us to share the voice mail in this report.",
