He added a couple of extra details on his report, but it remains unchanged.The witness didn't get a good look at the facial features. He did notice the head shape was more round and not conical. The arms seemed long. The figure casually walked across the road with no real concern or hurry. It took about four steps as it crossed.Two years ago, he returned to the general location, but had trouble remembering exactly where it took place; the area had changed some. He was curious why the creature was out that evening in the cold/wet weather crossing the road.   ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the reporter for almost 2 hours and felt that her details of the incident were accurate, consistent, and trustworthy. She was working with a California non-profit doing user surveys of land areas and issue reporting for the Klamath National Forest Service (specifically grazing/timber usage/fishing/ etc). She and her work partner were sleeping out most nights and this night in particular they decided to drive along 96 looking for RVs and angler fishermen along river to speak with. At about 6pm they stopped and decided to make camp for the evening. They found a campground/picnic area while it was still light and decided to camp beside the river. They set up their tents about 15 ft apart, cooked food on a camp stove, and ate dinner before settling in to sleep. They built no fire and were fairly quiet throughout this period. At about 10pm they fell asleep and she states she was in a sound sleep when she was awakened by a \"step/drag/step/drag\" limping sound coming from a slope near their car and the road (it would now be about midnight). The slope was roughly 10ft away from where they were camped and the sound was 75 yrds up the slope. The sound was obviously bipedal and she became somewhat afraid it was a crazy person in the woods so she picked up a knife she had with her and sat up in her sleeping bag. After a few minutes and the sound getting closer she shined her flashlight towards sound and the sound stopped. She couldn't see anything other than the light itself. In researching the date and time it would have been a new moon so the night would have been extremely dark. She turned off the flashlight and the walking began again still moving in their direction. It got within 10 yds and then began to make a gurgling/ throaty noise. She estimates that it is now about 20ft away. She states that she was very nervous and that her adrenaline was soaring. The animal was silent for about 10 seconds and then began making a \"very loud inward focused 'I'm injured' kind of whimpering; a sort of moaning/ crying kind of sound\". She says that it sounded as if it was asking for help, almost that it had sought them out. It cried like this for 30 seconds uninterrupted then ceased any noise. During the crying it sounded as if it may have sat or laid down. She and her companion both stayed awake for the next two or so hours not moving or speaking and then just \"passed out\" due to exhaustion and adrenaline. She felt that the animal never left during that time. Around 5am she awakened to a tremendous splash in the river (the other side of the river is a deep wilderness area). She laid in her tent the rest of the morning never sleeping again. At first light she got up and looked for tracks finding nothing in the deep leaf cover other than \"scrapes and drags\" in the leaves.",
