Used to take my kids there when they where young. It was 7miles west of Hwy 27.Had drove about 3miles on pavement and it turned to dirt. Hadnt been on the dirt road a mile or less and looked up the road and caught a black upright something on the edge of the road heading into the bushes.I know what I saw,but Im still in disbelief and feel strange telling anyone ,but I know what I saw. I wish I would have stopped and thought to check for foot prints, but It really spooked me and the kids after I told them.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness and she had additional detail to add. She estimated the animal to be approx. 7 ft tall.  Wide shoulders and long arms were noticed. The estimated distance between her car and the animal was approx. 70 ft.  She observed the animal as it was walking on two legs, exiting the gravel road into the brush. There was still some light on this summer evening as the time of day was right before sundown.  Because of the time of day and the briefness of the sighting, I have decided to categorize this report as a Class B.",
