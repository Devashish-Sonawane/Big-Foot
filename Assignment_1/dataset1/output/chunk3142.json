Both the witness and his son were struck by the similarity between the \u0093Whoops and Knocks\u0094 recording from the BFRO site and what they heard.\u0095  The animal came from the east along the ridge, approached the camp within 100 yards, went around their camp in a wide circle, and then went down the mountain to the north.  The vocalizations lasted about ten minutes and echoed considerably.  Dave is a very experienced hunter and woodsman.  He is familiar with the animals in the area in question and their habits.",
