            "Observed": "I was a Boy scout in the early 70\"s on a camping trip.on a summer night a friend and myself were walking on a gravel road with tall pine trees on both sides ,it was in the bass river state forest.the moon was full and we were getting ready to crest a hill when we smelled something really foul,I thought something was dead ,and nearby,I didn't really think much of it. we crested the gravel hill when we heard gravel being kicked ,mind you the only light we had was the moon light.when we heard this we stoped and I was a little scared cauce I thought it might be some guy in the woods scopen us out. we were froze for a few moments as to not make any noise ,then we both saw a silhouette of a very large thing and what ever it was ,we were able to make out that it was like a giant hair ball running across the road.we were pretty scared at this point and looked at each other and said words like lets get the hell out of here .my guess is that it was at least 7' tall with a heavy stride.we both took off back to camp,when we got back we told our scoutmaster and all he did was laugh and say \"ya sure now go to bed\".I kinda voided it out of my mind for years always beleving that something WAS there,and i just kept it to myself.Then I found your site and read the siteing of the boy on the bike in manahawkin,N.J",
