            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken with the witness several times over the past few months. This man has a very sound knowledge of the area, his experiences come along with a detailed knowledge of the typical animals that inhabit the area. It is my understanding that this person is a very avid outdoorsman, spending the majority of his time hunting or hiking. The experiences outlined here are just the tip of the iceberg in regards to the continuing activity that is usually associated with Sasquatch inhabiting an area. I plan to keep in touch and hope to join him in a few outings in the near future. I hope to obtain some pictures of possible stick structures and a possible \"nest\" that Randy suspects he found in the area. The area that this report took place is very near to the town of Republic. This is a very rural and isolated area. I encourage anyone else who has had a possible experience in this area, or the northern end of Okanogan County to please file a report.",

Everyting looked the same eventually no matter which way I headed, and I kept ending up in the same place. I have been fishing and hiking in this area since I was a child though, and knew that if I followed Mishonagan creek, then headed away from it westward, I would eventually reach civilization. I couldn't find the creek any longer however, but knew that I had to go past the swamp.",
