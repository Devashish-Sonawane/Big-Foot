            "Observed": "REPORT:  In the summer of 1977, I was in the U.S Army, stationed at Fort Huachuca Arizona.  During this period of my military career, I was assigned to the post drill team.  As part of our duties we did functions such as parades, special ceremonies, and military funerals.  Fort Huachuca is approximately 70miles south of Tucson.  I remember it was a day in July, on a Saturday morning.  We had to do a funeral in some small town in Arizona.  I don't remember the name of the town.  What I do remember is that it was a beautiful day, not a cloud in the sky, it was a perfect day.  If you know anything about Arizona, its desert, and on a clear day, you can see for miles.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Summery:  John was very descriptive and I believe that he observed a bigfoot creature.Updated 6/11/2010 by R.H. The person who made the report stated that he never wanted to be contacted or even have to discuss this report again.  He has a top security job with the government, and really wants to forget what he had seen that fateful day, and doesn\u0092t want anybody he works with or any of his family, to ever know about his episode.  But, he had to tell somebody. The gentleman, who turned this report in, was still very shook-up about it after all the years that were between the encounter, and our interview.  At that time of the encounter, he thought he was seeing the devil, and/or one of his minions.  At the time that I called him, I think that he still wasn\u0092t too sure just what he saw, so I tried to convince him that he wasn\u0092t seeing the devil, but a live and breathing creature that few people have ever witnessed, and hopefully I made him believe me. The reporting party was about 50 feet or so away from the creature when it first came into his view, when it first came out of a culvert that was under his side of the highway. The creature then proceeded away from his location across the highway, north bound, and on into the desert.  What I find interesting about this report is the fact that this creature can hide in plane sight.  He had to be pretty close to see the facial features change to fear when the creature seen the 18 wheeler rolling down the highway towards him.  I believe he told us most everything that he remembered on that fateful day, and he did a real good job for still being spooked out of his mind!  He was real happy to talk with someone who wouldn\u0092t make fun of him, and believed what he had to say.  It was like a large load off of his shoulders. Ok, it was like a very large load off of his shoulders, or something similar. As to the size and weight of this creature, I now believe that most folks do under estimate both, because, to most folks, there just can\u0092t be something that big running around out there and still go unnoticed by man. This was my first thoughts before I became involved with the BFRO.",

My incident however was simply footprints in the snow.  I saw the footprints in the snow in the morning.  We had snow the night before.  The footprints started around a tree in front of our house.  I followed them and they led around the back of our house to another tree.  The footprints then circled around the area in front of the tree about 4 full circles and then stopped.  There were no footsteps leading from the circle to anywhere else, as well as no footsteps back to the front of the house.  I put a garbage can lid over one of the prints to preserve it until I could take a picture of it.  Unfortunately I never had a chance.",

Where the footprints started there was a cherry, apple, and chesnut tree.  About 30 yards to the right of the chicken coup there was a shed that we had built little cages for our rabbits.  In between the chicken coup and shed/rabbit cages was a thick area of rasberry, and black berry bushes.  And to the immediate front right side of the shed/rabbit cages was a young pear tree.",
