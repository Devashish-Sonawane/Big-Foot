            "Observed.1  ": "\"In the middle of the night, I was awakened by what I call, 'Darth Vader' breaths,\" said Greene. Greene said he was able to capture a thermal image of Sasquatch that night. \"The image is the first comprehensive thermal image of a Sasquatch? even though I admit that it's blurry,\" said Greene. In the video, Greene claims you can see a big creature come out of the woods and grab a candy bar that was set up to attract the Sasquatch. \"It can't be anything else, I mean, it literally can't be anything else,\" said Greene. Greene said many people have said the image is just a guy in a fat suit or gorilla suit, but he claims the thermal image proves it's something different. \"The heat signature - which is what you're looking at?the heat signature would be completely different. It would be splotchy,\" said Greene. \"You could put a guy in a Bigfoot costume and fool night vision, because that's just like a video camera. But if you put a thermal image on him, that's going to look completely different.\" After seeing the video, Greene was convinced he had captured video of the much-discussed creature Bigfoot. \"Yeah, there's no doubt about it,\" said Greene. Greene admits that he, and the rest of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, are surprised there has not been better proof after several years of searching and many attempts to get a glimpse of the evasive alleged creature. \"We have, in the organization, maybe 200 game cams out looking for Sasquatches. We haven't got one lousy picture of a Sasquatch, which doesn't make any sense, unless you think that maybe these things are so smart that they either see the game cam,\" said Greene. Greene said there is no doubt he caught one of the rare images of the increasingly evasive creature. \"Clear as a bell, absolutely unequivocally, no doubt what it was - to me, anyway,\" said Greene. A majority of scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax, rather than a legitimate animal, in part because some estimate large numbers necessary to maintain a breeding population. Greene said fossils of a sasquatch-like creature have been unearthed in China. He claims the creature came over the land bridge that used to exist between Asia and Alaska. ",

            "Observed.1  ": "Copyright 2010 by Dale Cox All Rights Reserved   A strange \"mini\" Bigfoot creature has been  spotted in this Parramore area swamp. February 23, 2010 - Unusual stories are part  of the charm of the historic community of Two  Egg, but some new ones coming out of an  area just seven miles northeast of the main  crossroads may just take the cake. Multiple witnesses now claim to have seen  something that can only be described as a  monster roaming the woods and swamps  between downtown Two Egg and the  Chattahoochee River. While the accounts  vary somewhat, the strange creature can  best be described as a \"mini\" Bigfoot. Two accounts that have come to our attention  here at www.twoeggfla.com both originate  from within one mile of each other, although  both are independent and with no connection  between the witnesses. The first eyewitness described hearing a  noise outside his home late at night. Going  outside to investigate, he says he was  stunned to see \"something upright, running  away on two legs.\" The creature or monster  was of about normal human height and was  pale in color. According to the witness, it ran  into a marshy area and could be heard  splashing away through a pond. An investigation of the area the next morning  revealed tracks leading straight down  through the mud into the pond, but it was  impossible to determine what might have left  them. They were not human footprints, but  were too large for a deer or other similar  animal. The soft, wet mud had obscured too  much of their appearance to determine much  more. The second sighting took place about three- fourths of a mile southwest of the first one  and near the intersection of Circle Hill and  Oak Grove Roads. An eyewitness saw a  small upright creature with long hair running  away through a marshy area. It was smaller  than average human height, but was running  on two legs. The individual relating the story  to our website described it as a \"hobbit\" or  \"mini\" Bigfoot. The sightings have prompted a great deal of  speculation in the area, where strange  howlings are often heard in the night. Some  are calling it the \"North Parramore Hobbit,\"  although the most popular term seems to be  the \"Two Egg Stump Jumper.\" It is worth noting that tales of small bigfoot  like creatures are not exactly new in Florida.  Residents of South and Central Florida have  been reporting an animal they call the \"skunk  ape\" for years. They are, however, very new to  the Two Egg area. Most residents take the stories with a bit of  tongue in cheek, but the witnesses very  plainly believe they saw something out of the  ordinary. \"I got a really strange feeling that I  was seeing something that wasn't supposed  to be there,\" said one. As the water level, which is near flood stage,  begins to drop, there are plans for a small  expedition into some of the area's swamps  to see if tracks or any other indication of the  creature's identity can be found. If you have similar such reports or any  information on what the \"Two Egg Stump  Jumper\" could be, please drop us an email  by clicking the Contact Us button in the left  hand column of this page. Residents have started calling the monster  the Two Egg Stump Jumper. The creature seems to roam in the wet  swampy areas near the Chattahoochee. The sightings have taken place within a  couple of miles of Parramore Landing.   Monster Search Update... Game Camera Catches Strange  Image in Stump Jumper Search! April 2, 2010 - A wildlife camera placed in the  swamps near Parramore Landing on Lake  Seminole nine miles east of the Two Egg  crossroads has captured an unexplained  image. Is it the Two Egg Stump Jumper?",
