            "Observed": "I have a small cabin built in the woods near West Union Ohio in Adams county. Spend usually each summer and fall there for a few nights each visit. On each night, we have heard howls and things/animals moving around cabin and finding our gear had been gone thru. No power and we usually sleep on the screened in porch. Never thought much of it. The last time we where there (June 2017), all heck broke loose. The first night we kept hearing things in the woods that sounded like children laughing/talking. Then at 2 am, we started hearing limbs break and pop. That was all around us. It ended after about 1 hour. The next night, at around 3 am, heard something in front of and out about 75 yards near the creek. Listened for a bit and then something let out a god awful howl and scream and ran towards us and then ran off in the woods breaking limbs. It was pitch black and didn't see whatever it was. The next morning we found numerous broken and down limbs but no prints. The canopy is thick and ground is covered with leaves/plants/moss and such. Did see a lot of trails and wore down areas all around. Found 1 huge tree snapped like a twig. We have never been back, Land and cabin is for sale now.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "While speaking to the cabin owner, it was quite obvious by his voice that that night affected him greatly, reliving that night as he told me of the happenings that weekend. To hear things out in the woods is one thing, to hear something drag a tree branch along the side of the side of your cabin late in the night is another. The second night was worse, he said. The \"little girls talking/giggling\" sounds the first night gave way to growls, howls, and at one point a high pitched scream, which \" Made my blood run cold...\"  Being set on a slight hill, the cabin sits on 4 X 4 posts on the porch side, looking over the yard. The footfalls of whatever came running up the hill, \"Must have been really heavy, because we felt each stomp through the porch floor...\" he said. \"Then as it ran off to the right, I heard the snap of a tree breaking as loud as a shotgun going off.\" I filmed the investigation of the property, and was intent on finding the tree or limb that had been broke. After about twenty minutes of looking, I found the limb. It was indeed 4 1/2 - 5 inches in thickness, and had broken in such a way that about 1/3 -1/4 of the limb had remained attached to the main trunk, allowing some of the limb to remain alive. Being able to reach the break with my fingers told me it to be 7 ft. off the ground. I gave the limb a thorough looking over and saw no evidence of human made damage. Most of the limb had the splitting/snapped look to the wood, and the rest of the limb/branches bore no rub marks that would have indicated a rope or cable been used to bring it down.The limb had broken where it met the main trunk, but not all the way through. Although I am no arborist, the broken limb was not in this condition due to storm damage, I surmised that due to the fact it is the ONLY limb broken on the tree, or any limbs in trees in the surrounding area.Something that was completely strange was finding three squarish holes that had been dug in a row, in the middle of the woods. The owner of the cabin had no knowledge of their existence. Also found was deer hair, jawbone, skull, and smallish pieces of other bones. The hair was approximately 30 or so feet from the limb, the skull and small bones about 10-12 feet, while the jawbone was a mere 5 feet from the base of the tree.Around the first weekend in this past May, the cabin owner's father-in-law stayed the night at the cabin and reported to the owner that he heard howls and screams that sounded like they came from down around the creek area.",

A young man who just dropped his father after a family event in St.Louis,Mo.and was returning home.The witness was driving with exteme caution due to the high deer population in that area and it was rutting season. He noticed that the rabbit was running west to east across the road and instead going into the brush on the right side of the road the rabbit instead turn north and ran up the road. That is when he saw the large figure on his right hand side running towards his direction 15' from the east heading west,just outside the beam of his headlights. It was running bi-pedal and very stocky in frame. Upon seeing this unknown animal heading towards him, the young man, in lack of better terms, floored it! As he drove north he kept looking to his right as the animal still advancing towards him as he drove off. ",
