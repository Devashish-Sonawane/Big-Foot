She could not estimate its height.It crossed the road in front of her on a very dark stretch of frontage road with no lights.  She guesses it was roughly 30 yards away when it crossed the road. There are several wild no-trespassing areas near by. The largest is the area surrounding Waller Mill Park Reservoir.",

The skin in the groin/lower abdominal area was pulled apart, and there was a small pool of blood in the wound. The calf was a newborn with a rope still tied around it's front legs. When I first saw it, I thought that the tear in the skin was caused by being pulled out of the birth canal by a pick-up truck (a common practice). But, after I found the hound,I think that I may have, inadvertantly interrupted a feeding. When I looked for the calf remains after I saw the hound, I found that the carcass was nowhere around.",

All the soft tissue (organs/muscles/connective tissue,etc.)was gone (with the exception of the entire head, the four paws and the skin and hair). It was apparently eaten by the same animal that had pulled upwards on the hound's chest wall and stretched out ligaments in an upward motion. The ligaments did not break but were stretched enough to easily remove the contents of the chest cavity.",

Close to the trash bins is a road that leads to the Honobia town dump from the opposite side of Boktuklo Mt.from where I entered. This was reported on the BFRO web site in Jan. 2000, I believe. (Which was why I was poking around the area.)",
