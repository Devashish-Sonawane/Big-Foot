He walked accross the logging road about 40 yards ahead of us.  He turned and looked right at us.  While he was crossing us there in the brushy draw, you could hear something that sounded like a Howler Monkey, it appeared to be his Mother.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This is an amazing sighting \u0096 set of sightings. They occurred in the vicinity of Caribou Lake, which is about 12 miles northwest of Sandpoint, Idaho. DB, the witness, is now 74 years old and still living in northern Idaho. I talked with him twice by phone and his son once. DB\u0092s daughter has no phone so was not reachable. DB repeated the stories about the yellow sasquatch and the \u0093young one\u0094 just as they were written in his report. It\u0092s hard to convey the quality of truthfulness and sincerity evident in his descriptions; all I can say is that I have no doubt that DB was being honest with me. And his sightings, especially the one in which he got to within eight feet of the animal \u0096 saw its fingernails and thumb, looked into its eyes \u0096 make misidentification extremely unlikely. \u0093It didn\u0092t have claws, it had fingernails like us,\u0094 he told me. DB described the \u0093female\u0094 as short, fairly squat, but strong looking, and he thought its legs were somewhat bowed \u0096 maybe it had some kind of dwarfism, he said. When I asked DB about the bear hunter and his hounds treeing the female he said he saw the incident fairly well and was certain about it. She stood out on the branch of the tree, he said. I asked about contacting the bear hunter but DB said he\u0092d moved from the area long ago and he had no idea where he went.DB\u0092s son, MB, who is now 37 years old, lives in Arkansas and is a long-haul trucker. He remembered the sightings \u0096 seeing the \u0093hairy kid\u0094 cross the trail, and the \u0093blonde one - my dad and sister saw that one a lot better than me,\u0094 he said. MB also mentioned that he saw a chestnut colored sasquatch that no one else saw \u0096 \u0093I used to take off into the woods\u0085 it was just walking by\u0085 it seemed twenty feet tall then but it was probably more like seven, eight feet.\u0094 He said at first he thought it was a bear, \u0093but it was walking on two legs\u0085 it was covered in long hair\u0085 it stunk real bad.\u0094 When I pressed for details about the sightings he said he couldn\u0092t add much, that he hadn\u0092t really thought about it for years.MB also told me that back then he saw sasquatch tracks on a few occasions, in mud by the creek and in snow; they were super sized, he said, he could fit both of his feet into one of the tracks. Like his father, MB impressed me as completely truthful. Neither man had any particular interest in whether or not the sighting was published on the BFRO web site. In fact neither owns a computer or has even seen the BFRO web site (DB\u0092s granddaughter helped him by typing in and submitting his report). When I asked MB if he thought bigfoot was real he replied, \u0093Let me tell you something, they\u0092re there!\u0094 DB\u0092s response to the same questions was, \u0093Oh, they\u0092re there, you can count on that. It\u0092s just that they\u0092re so good at hiding. But when you see one you know.\u0094 DB can\u0092t outrun sasquatches anymore; in June he\u0092s having a knee replaced. He told me that if I want to go up there \u0096 up there where the cedars were ten feet through \u0096 he\u0092d like to go along. Maybe we\u0092ll do that.",
