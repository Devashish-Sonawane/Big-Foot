            "Follow-Up Report": "This gentleman was very forth coming. A former National Guardsman, visiting in-laws in southern Alabama. He was on his way out to the car to retrieve the luggage before going to bed. It was a quiet, still evening with no clouds. With a flashlight he went toward the car, that is when he heard a snorting grunt from the back of the carport. He then saw a shape back lit by the pole light. The figure was about 8ft 6 inches tall (compared to a broken branch found the next day) 3- 4 feet wide and about 500- 600 lbs. The man then drew his side arm and called out. The animal made the same sound again. He thought it might even be a person. Again the sound was repeated, alarmed the man without losing eye contact made his way to the car trunk, where he removed his rifle. It was stated that he never felt threatened. Upon the man gaining his rifle the creature backed off and retreated into the woods. The man then went into the house to retrieve a better light, upon returning with the wife and mother-in-law in tow there was nothing. The next day there were scuff marks on the ground and a broken branch where the creature was seen.The man was told of others that had seen the same thing over the years. In fact. his in-laws have had meat removed from freezers on the carport while other valuables are left undisturbed.The area is wooded with a river and streams, a wildlife preserve, plenty of deer and hog around, along with wild berries and peanut fields.

We just left the main paved highway through Narbona Pass, Indian Service Route 32, Hwy 134, between Sheep Springs, NM and Crystal, NM. We went south on a dirt road, Indian Service Route 32, into the Chuska Mountains. we were about 5-8 miles into the mountains, when we came upon a small hill that curved towards the east, then to the south. As we approached the hill to go up, the road quickly turned right/south. As we reached the top, we saw the full moon and it lit up a flat green pasture that was on top of the hill.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness by phone on 1/13/13.There was a light rain falling as they drove toward the subject.  With the moon shining through a break in the clouds they could see something was standing near a pool of water.  As he turned his lights toward the subject it began to move. In the headlights they saw a dark brown hair covered animal turning away then running over the hill.  The movement was like a person but very smooth and quick, in seconds it was gone.  They sat and discussed what just happened then moved on, about three minutes had went by since they first saw it.  The road they were on continued around the other side of the hill but too much time went by to see anything.  They were compelled to return the next day to look for tracks in the daylight but unfortunately the ground was too hard.This area is at about 8,960' with areas of clear meadows and clusters of trees just east of the Arizona border on the Navajo Reservation.Being Native American and growing in this area he heard many stories about these animals but was always skeptical until this opportunity came along.",
