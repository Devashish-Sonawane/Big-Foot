She said the creature seemed  somewhat smaller and lighter than black bear she had seen.  The group would not have seen the animal squatted beside an upper reach of Squaw Creek (probable named creek) drinking, if it had not moved.  The method of drinking with cupped paws (hands) and upright walking is what puzzled the family travelers, along with the keen olfactory sense of their blind brother.  They did not know that bear did those kinds of behavior? The incident was agreed to be dismissed for years until recently.The creature was apparently observed from 500-800 feet over several minutes as it moved out of sight away from the creek into the open pine forest.",

When I arrived at the top I found to my surprise that someone was up there this year ( I was shocked that any person would have hiked to this remote location). I followed the foot prints to where they were going because they were going to the valley overlook... as I was walking it was much easier to step into the tracks of the person (the snow was about 1 foot deep)... as I did this I was shocked at the size of the man I was trying to step into the foot steps of..... I almost could not take such huge steps... as the foot prints went under the shadow of the evergreen tree I saw what shocked me.... the foot print were bare foot!!!!!!!!! I could see toe prints clearly!!!! at fist I could not believe it and I looked again and again and measured them and looked at more thinking I was going crazy ....... I got scared and the hair on my neck stood up!!!!!!!!!!! It was very very spooky!!!! and I was alone and going to spend the night with this animal..... I decided to leave imediately....",

            "Also Noticed": "As I was hiking off the mountain, and down into Rock Canyon I again came across the tracks and they led to a small pine tree that was about 3 inches in diamiter and the tree was busted off about 2 feet off the ground and the tree was tossed to the side yet the tracks went in circles around the tree to the point that it was packed down (maybe 20 times). Then the tracks went off in another direction than where they came in. It was clear that the animal had picked out the tree and had performed some kind of ritual and then left. The interesting thing was that the animal had not left a track inside the circle and it had reached into the circle and snapped the tree off (the circle was about 3 feet out from the tree? I remembered being very spooked. I am very very familiar with all animals in nature and I have hunted almost every animal and I know it was very unusual.  The footprints were fresh and very clearly showed the imprints of a very very large bare foot!!! I measured the foot with my arm and it was about 15 inches...",

Then hike up the ravine to the top and then turn East and hike about a half  mile and then you turn South and go up to the top of the mountain (you eventually are at the location where you look down into Rock Canyon from the top). It is very very remote and the most difficult access area. This is where I saw the signs and foot prints.",
