This set of howls was repeated three times over an hour. No response was heard.At about 10:00 pm, a very loud branch break woke him up. It was about fifty to seventy five feet away from their tent. Later, after they awakened to a distant howl, the witness repeated the above sets of howls. About thirty seconds after each set, one response howl was heard. The response howls did move closer. After about an hour, no further responses were heard. The track was found the next morning less than twenty feet from the tent. It was in dried mud where a little water had pooled in this one spot. The witness looked for other tracks but there was a lot of vegetation around the tent. One picture shown gives an example of the trees and vegetation at the location. The son is in the picture (used by permission.)The witness would like the specific spot kept confidential. No foul odor was detected. ",
