            "Observed": "My late Grandparents owned a home outside of Scottsville, Kentucky for many years in Allen County.  The area has always been well-known for sightings of the \"monkey man\" as he is called there throughout this area of Kentucky (Monkey Man Hollow).  The first sightings began back in the old pioneer days.  This story is true because my late Grandmother, an honest woman and Christian, saw one of these \"bigfoot\" creatures on two seperate occasions both at night time.  I was there during one encounter she had as well.  This creature would come into their front yard at night and lean up or kneel down against a large beech tree in their front yard.  She described the creatures as standing tall and upright, and walking like a man.  Both creatures were covered with white, and somewhat curly, hair all over.  I thought they may be older ones of these creatures because of the white hair.  The creatures just got up and walked away on two feet just like a person would do back into the woods.  Also, a friend and neighbor who lived down the road from them saw a Sasquatch one time leaning against a fence post in his front yard across a road in broad daylight.  He has told this story to lots of people many times, and always the same way.  When his dogs gave chase to the creature, tall and upright like a man with brown hair all over, just leaped over the fence and walked away into the valley below.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the grandson by phone and found him to be credible. Although he has heard howling screams from the timber, he has not seen the creature. His grandmother had seen it twice in her own yard. Both times it had white shaggy hair.  He was present the second time when his grandmother had a gun and was going to shoot at the animal from the front doorway. Concerned for her safety, he pulled her into the house without taking a look for himself. He was 46 years-old at the time. His grandmother passed away in 2004.     ",
