            "Observed": "On the evening of April 7, 2020, we decided to do a little catfish fishing at a creek off of Piedmont lake in Egypt Valley. We backed our truck up to the water, dropped the tailgate, built a fire and started fishing. This was around 9pm. The moon was so full we didn't need a lantern. It was very still and quiet out until we heard a few coyote's howl followed by some frogs croaking.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness and arranged to meet him at the location of the encounter.We met up in Egypt Valley at 4:30 in the afternoon in order to get a good visual of the area in daylight. The Egypt Valley Wildlife Area is over 4,000 acres that spreads across three counties, bordered on the north by Piedmont Lake. It was heavily strip mined up through the 90's and still has mining activity to this day. The majority of it was never reclaimed and is deeply scarred and overgrown.The witness had been fishing since just before dark, a little before 11:00 pm they heard something walking, east to west, on the other side of the 15 foot wide creek. Even though there was a full moon, the brush on the other bank is very thick except for a narrow animal trail that came down to the waters edge.While investigating the area in daylight, there wasn't any area to cross up and down the creek. As they were listening to the foot steps, there was a loud hoot like an owl would make, just a single hoot, beyond the area of the foot steps. It was followed by another single hoot to the west. Farther down the creek, in the direction the foot steps were going, there was a loud crashing noise that sounded like a tree being brought down. During the daylight investigation and reviewing satellite images of the area on the other side of the creek, I didn't find any access for miles in any direction. During mining activity in the 80's there were multiple cement 'tubes' that allowed a 'haul road' to cross the creek. They were removed in the 90's creating a pool of deep water. The only other entrance to the area was near Rt. 40, over 3 miles away. That access road was closed off and made impassible.",

            "Observed": "I saw a Sasquatch face to face at 24 ft. The details were shocking. It was large and hair covered, looking at me and I was frozen in place. It was behind a small rise in the ground making only mid chest to the top of its head visible. The hair was reddish brown color and was short from the top of the head getting longer down its body. The short hair on the body was thinner and around five inches long. The arm hair was much longer at eighteen inches. The face was hair covered like a mans beard and lighter in color.. The Sasquatch had the same look that I had, a surprised look. Eyes were opened wide and mouth. I seen no teeth. The head was not cone shaped. Eyes were brown and looking me up and down. The right arm was stuck out to the side with a bend. I didn't see ears.",

This was his first sighting and a rare, close up encounter. Most daylight sightings are at a distance and short duration, making details sketchy at best. This witness described the event as one he'll never forget. A local sketch artist generated a graphic from his description and will be added to this report at a later time.His observations were: Distance of less than 25 feet, mid chest to top of head visible behind terrain, body as wide as his Jeep Liberty, facial features very human like, no outward aggression from the creature, simultaneous exit by both human and sasquatch in opposite directions. This individual has had several encounters with sasquatches. Another night investigation he conducted resulted in his seeing eye shine from two animals near Shenandoah, VA. Other locations provided interaction with the creatures through vocalizations and wood knocks. He and I separately investigated a sighting near Max Meadows, Wythe County, VA from 2012. A fisherman was surprised by a sasquatch at his favorite fishing hole, apparently the favorite of both human and sasquatch.",
