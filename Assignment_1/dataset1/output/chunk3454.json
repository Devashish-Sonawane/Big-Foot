            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone:He does not remember the day but it was mid October.It was lightly raining but he could see several hundred yards. He stopped to watch a hillside and ridge for deer for about five minutes. He and his son did not get out of the truck. As he mentioned, a black outline that he thought was a stump remained motionless while they watched for deer. It was next to a medium sized tree and the witness admits it was difficult to judge height at that distance. There were game animal trails throughout the area. The figure or stump had a round head with no neck. He said it had square shoulders like a Bigfoot statue. He could not see arms. He did not have binoculars. But it was not there two to three minutes later when they came back to the location.The windows were up in the truck so they did not detect any odor. He is aware of abandoned mines in the area but they are sealed with steel bars. He has hunted all his life. This \"disappearing stump\" very much reminded him of a Bigfoot statue. ",
