            "Follow-Up Report": "The witnesses were interviewed by phone and at length in person. This report is unusual in that there was an extended time of interaction lasting 2 1/2 months. I found the witnesses to be very reliable and consistent, giving details that only people with extended time in contact with the creatures can know. Based on the witnesses' accounts, and the on-site evaluation at the location, which resulted in some class A and class B encounters by the investigators.,I can only conclude that these two witnesses did indeed have interaction with a family of sasquatches.The following pictures were taken at the sites.This is the pond where the first encounter took place,This is where the female witness saw the big one. There is a spring in the middle of the area shown.This is the spur road where the witnesses saw the red eyes.Interesting arrangement of log and sticks woven together. Note how the sticks are arranged. Both sides of the log are this way.  The faint impression below was found near here.Assisting with the on-site investigation were BFRO investigators John Andrews, Ric Hjertberg, and Walt Philemonof; and the male witness.",

            "Observed": "It was 2:35 in the morning on July 26, 2006. I recieved a call from my dad which alone is very unusual to say the least. He started by saying \"you are not going to  believe  what i just saw\". He said he steped out onto his porch(which  wraps around his house) to sit in his chair and have a smoke. He got about half way through with it when he said he heard the most terrifying sound ever. He  stepped in the door and grabbed a MAG light to take a look and when he did he saw a sillouette of a bipedal creature approx 8 foot tall and 75 yards away stand up near the pond and quickly run towards the neibors house which is to the right and behind him. At this point my dad is completely freaked out. He hears the loud moan again 3 more times each time getting softer in the distance. He then wakes my mother (who thinks he just lost his marbles) and she comes outside with him. She also hears the moan and a gun shot approx the same distance away but at this point it is an estimatted 1 mile away. This is when  he calls me and describes what happened. I get in my truck and go overe to their house to take a look around with him. Whatever it was is long gone by the time i get there and we just look  around to put both  my mom and dad somewhat at ease. The  reason i am writing this instead of my dad is 1) he dont t know how to use a computer and 2) i felt a report needed to be  made and i doubt he would ever do it. I can  tell you that i have never seen or heard my dad so scared in my life.",

            "Also Noticed": "After i arrived my dad and i went to  the pond where he seen it and noticed some weeds were pushed over in this one section. we didnt disturb it in hopes of looking  at it in the daylight. We also saw what we  think could have been a heel impression but again we were waiting for daylight to get a closer look. When i was on the phone with him i talked him in to going over to the pond which wasn't easy since he was  very scared at the time. he didn't have any shoes on but he told me that the ground was warm where he had seen him. he could literally feel the difference in temperature in his feet. We looked for tracks but the ground is very hard and had no luck in the dark. He kept trying to vocalize  what he had heard and when he did i kept trying to remember where i had heard that before. After he kept saying that he had never heard anything like it before in his life i told him  that i wanted him to listen to something on the computer. I played him several bigfoot audio sounds from the west coast and he kept saying it was to high pitched. I then played the ohio clip fron 1994 and immediately he said that that is what he heard except louder. As soon as he said that he made me stop the clip because it was freaking him out again.",
