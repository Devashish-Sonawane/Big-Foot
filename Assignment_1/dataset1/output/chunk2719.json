            "Observed": "My fiance and I were camping out on the banks of the Duck River last summer. Around 2 a.m. we could hear dogs from across the river barking. (It was also a full moon.) All of a sudden, from down the river (it sounded like, anyway) we heard a loud,deep,howl (just like the recordings of Big Foot on tv) that lasted almost ten seconds. All of the dogs, critters, etc. that were making noise went completely silent. We waited up,kind of scared, but never heard it again and the dogs, etc. never made any other noises either. My fiance is an avid hunter and knows all of the sounds out in woods day or night. He says he has never heard anything like that before. Whatever it was, it had to be something that all of the other animals knew to fear.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness at length and she was very sincere in her description of this event.  The howl was described as sounding very similar to the Ohio and Mississippi Howls found on the BFRO website, which she has frequented.  They both felt it was no more than half a mile away.   She was particularly impressed with the complete silence which followed the howl for many hours. When she was growing up, her great uncle used to talk about sightings in the area.  The class A sighting in Report #565 occurred close to this location.",

            "Also Noticed": "The most striking thing was the odd behaviour of the dog(s). Anyone who has owned a Malamute knows they are very bold dogs that basically aren't afraid of anything, especially when there's more than one. When the dogs (near Oregon) tried to claw their way into the tent, it sent shivers up my spine and I must say I didn't get much sleep that night. Again, with the incident at Richardson Grove, the dog actually stood up on its hindlegs and \"walked\" while lunging forward up a steep bank dragging my friend who weighed about 170 lbs with it in its pursuit of the thing that left big footprints. Never had that dog done that before or since in spite of many wilderness adventures, bear, elk, deer, etc. encounters.",
