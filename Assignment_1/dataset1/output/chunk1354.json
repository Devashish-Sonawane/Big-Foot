I believe this was on a saturday another friend of mine and myself decided to ride my horses back to see conrad.The ride took about 2-2& 1 half hours. after gettinging there conrad told me a story. it goes like this. \"yesterday afternoon he shot a deer and hung it from a tree behind his house. that night as he was going to let his dogs out they started whinning and would not leave.then he heard a scream a type he never heard before coming from the back of the house. he went outside on his back pourch and said he saw a large ape like creature looking back at him. he then stated it grabed his deer and ran off back into the forest area. at first laugh it off then he said come look at this. he showed myself and this other friend where it stood and where ran away to. while it ran away with the deer it had taken out about 20 feet of barbed wire fence and left some hair on one of the barbs. Well I haved hunted all my life and never seen hair quite like it it looked like bear but not really.\" he never reported because he did not want the publicity as he was avery private person. I don't if you believe me or not but this is his story as told to me.",
