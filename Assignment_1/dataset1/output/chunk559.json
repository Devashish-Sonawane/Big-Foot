In a remote spot on the river on Joint Base Lewis McCord I was with my dog Oscar. The fire had just started to catch up and my dog started barking toward the river ferociously. This is very out of character for him. I told him to be quiet and come back to me. I then heard large rocks being thrown into the river. I went to inspect with my flashlight and saw nothing. They were large rocks because I could hear them hitting the rocks on the bottom of the river. There were more than 5 rocks thrown. The experience was so creepy that I immediately put my dog in my Jeep and left.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with this witness over the phone. I do not have access to Joint Base Lewis-McChord, so I can not do a site survey.  The witness recounted his experience of that evening.  In addition to what the witness wrote there are a couple of other details. First, there were five to seven rocks thrown. Second, they were large rocks and he could hear them hit bottom with a \u0093clunk\u0094 when they splashed into the river. The witness began to become creeped out; he said he got the \u0093heebie-jeebies\u0094 and became uneasy enough that he decided to leave.  He has not been back to that place since.I asked him if he could see where they came from, but it was too dark and he could not tell. He could not see the rocks either. The moon that night was a few of days past full. It would have just risen, low on the horizon, and possibly still behind the Cascade Mountains at the time of the encounter, so the night would have been dark. In addition, the witness had a fire going, so his night vision would not be developed. This would have made it difficult to see where the rocks came from.Sasquatches are known to throw rocks. The fact that the rocks were large would make it unlikely that a person could throw them. There were no people on his side of the river, and the river is about 200 feet wide at this location, so it is unlikely that a person could have thrown them, as they landed on his side of the river. The reaction of the dog and the circumstances of the events lead me to conclude that it is likely, but not certain, that a sasquatch threw the rocks.",
