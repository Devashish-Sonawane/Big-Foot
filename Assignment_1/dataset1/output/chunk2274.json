            "Follow-Up Report": "I had the witness meet me at the Preble County library in Eaton, Ohio during a Bigfoot seminar that I hosted. The amazing thing that stood out to me was that even before she talked about their track find, there were multiple unrelated people in the audience that were claiming strange vocalizations and even a few sightings from that same area of Twin Creek just outside of Gratis. The incident mentioned is BFRO Report #4972. This location is an ideal place for any large animals to come and go through this specific part of Ohio. The creek sits in a wooded valley and goes for many miles, ending into the Great Miami River, which eventually flows into the Ohio River. After the seminar, fellow BFRO investigator Jeff Crisman and I followed the witnesses to the location for an onsite investigation. They took us to the exact spot where the track was found heading over a sandbar into the creek. At the time, the water level was way down but there was plenty of evidence of the water level rising and lowering throughout the year. They did note that toes could be seen in the track but sand and debris caused some visual distortion. An abundance of deer tracks were everywhere as well as signs of people fishing in the area. The sides of the valley were quite thick the closer you were to the river leading up to the hillsides of mature hardwood trees. We hiked maybe a half mile down the valley and was quite amazed on how quiet and the remote the area seemed to be. Photo of the possible track they found on June 7th. Measured 15\" x 7\" x 5\":Photos taken at our follow-up interview on location. The witness is pointing where the track was found and which direction it was heading. The rocky substrate really hindered finding any additional tracks.",
