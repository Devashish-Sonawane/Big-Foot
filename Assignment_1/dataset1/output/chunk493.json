            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with TP over the phone and he had these details to add to his report.In Oct of 09, he and his son had been scouting about six miles into the swamp to locate an ideal place to hunt for deer. During the scouting trip, they both smelled an unusual, \u0091nasty\u0092 smell. When the son questioned TP about the source of the smell, TP ignored his question.TP admitted to me that he had smelled the same odor before when he was much younger, while riding dirt bikes in the area with his friends. He stated that this was the first time he had seen this type of creature in the woods.After coming out of the woods, they both decided to drive to the store for drinks. It was then, at approximately 11:30AM, that they turned a sharp corner on the limestone road and saw a 'bigfoot' standing near the side of the road. \"I knew what I saw. I knew that it was a bigfoot\" Stated TP, \"But I kept going, while keeping my eye on it. I guess I was in a state of disbelief. I only stopped because my son said, \u0091Dad, was that what I think it was?\u0092 It was then that I had to admit to myself what I saw, and turned around. By then it was gone.\u0094-The sighting lasted for approximately 10-15 seconds as they were driving by at approximately 15-20 MPH. -The distance from the creature from the closest point was about 20-25 feet away, near the right side of the road. -When first seen, the creature was standing near the edge of the road partially obscured by a scrub oak, with one leg upraised behind it. \u0093It looked like it was about to step onto the road. Then, when we got closer, it looked like it was trying to stay real still. After we passed it, it began backing up slowly, like it wanted to hide behind something. There wasn\u0092t much of anything for it to hide behind, just some pine trees, scrub oaks and palmettos. By the time I passed it and got turned around, it was gone.\u0094- It was approximately 7 \u00bd to 8 foot tall. The width of its shoulders was about 3-3 \u00bd foot across. \u0093Its shoulder span was about one and a half the span of my shoulders.\u0094 Stated TP.- Its hair was a dark brown, with reddish tints. \u0093It looked more like hair than fur.\u0094 Said TP. \u0093The hair on its face looked shorter and the hair on its body was longer.\u0094- The body build was \u0093extremely muscular.\" \"Its torso was thick and its arms were about as thick as my calves. The legs were also very thick and had a defined muscular appearance.\u0094- The hands were \"huge.\" - Its eyes were dark.  It had a flat, wide nose. The mouth was also wide. The ears could not be seen but as TP put it, \u0093I could see where the ears should have been but there was hair covering that area.\u0094- The neck was short and the head was big. \u0093It looked like a gorilla head. My son said that its head looked like a cross between Chewbacca\u0092s head and a gorilla.\u0094Once they turned around, TP and his son got out of the truck at the spot where they saw it. TP stated that he smelled the same odor they had previously smelled while walking through the woods. \u0093I can\u0092t describe it. It\u0092s got a smell all of its own. If I had to try to describe it, I would say that it was something like a cross between a skunk, a boar looking for a sow, and something else that I just can\u0092t describe. It\u0092s nasty.\u0094They also looked for tracks, but only found large impressions in the ground as well as smashed-down palmetto plants. TP had also related that the next day, in the same area, he heard the sounds of wood knocks, large limbs being broken, and a deep growl. TP then left the area.\u0093I figured that it was giving me a warning to leave. I wasn\u0092t exactly scared of it, but I knew that it didn\u0092t want me there, so I left.\u0094When asked if he would ever go back there again, TP was matter-of fact in his reply. \u0093I\u0092ve been hunting those woods since I was a kid and I\u0092ve been in my share of close calls with wild animals. Yeah, I would go out there again because I love the woods. And I hope I will see another bigfoot one day. I don\u0092t think that they would ever intentionally try to hurt me, but with all wild animals I would treat it with the respect it deserves.\u0094The sighting took place on an access road near the northern portion of the Richloam Wildlife Management Area in Sumter County. Open to hunting, the Richloam area is also a favorite destination for hikers, horseback riders and campers because of its rich ecological diversity. Made up of 56,000 acres, it is one of seven large tracts of land that make up the Withlacoochee State Forest. It is composed of pine flatwoods, oak hammocks, bottomland hardwoods and cypress swamps, as well as part of the Little Withlacoochee River. Although it is popular with the outdoors community, much of it is inaccessible and remains pristine and undisturbed. (Note-a scrub oak is a fairly scrawny member of the oak family that is characterized by numerous gnarled branches and thick leaves. It only grows to a height of about nine foot, with a bole of about four-six inches in diameter.)",

            "Observed": "We set out to do some squatching at Interstate State Park in Wisconsin.  Our party consisted of 4 adults and 2 children.  We set up camp and had dinner in the South Campground.  After dark we began our first night op at 10pm.  We left my wife and the 2 year old in camp with the fire.  Nick, his pregnant wife Jennie, their 5 year old son Atticus, and I went up a small ridge above our campsite to begin.  We walked slowly working south east of camp and further from the campground.  After about 5 minutes we heard something in the woods following us intermittently we stopped and waited with lights off for about 4 minutes. We continued to walk and stop with lights off until we got about a half mile from the camp.  At this point Atticus, the 5 year old, was ready to go back.  We started back and then stopped to do some whoops.  I did two whoops spaced about 30 seconds apart, no returned noises.  We continued to walk and stop.  When we were halfway back we let Atticus try some whoops.  He did two about 30 seconds apart.  After his second whoop there was an immediate response from within a hundred yards of us.  It was a slightly higher pitch whoop than I have heard before.  We waited about 4 minutes before continuing to go back to camp.  When we were about 100 yards from camp we stopped.  Jennie and Nick remained with lights off as Atticus and I turned our flashlights on and returned to camp.  As they sat by a tree they both heard something approaching them from the direction of the returned whoop.  It got so close that Nick stood up.  Then it took \u0093four large, quick, heavy steps\u0094 back.  When Nick turned his flashlight on nothing was seen.  They then returned to camp.  As we sat and debriefed in camp we heard noises around camp, but dismissed them as raccoons.  I was looking to the woods beyond camp and began to see orange eye shine.  I thought it was a single star, but it moved lightly and would leave and return into view.  The next morning I saw that where I was seeing the glow was well below the ridge line and could not have been a star. Nick and I traded places while sitting in camp and he saw the same shine leave and return a few times as well.  Nick and I returned to near where he and Jennie had sat to leave an apple in a tree.  We all went to bed around 12:30 am.  Nick, Atticus, and I slept in a tent while Jennie, Sara and Hagen slept in a small teardrop camper.  After falling asleep Nick and I both woke up abruptly at 1:35am.  We immediately looked outside the tent to see a raccoon on the picnic table.  When we made noises to scare it away we heard something else moving around camp. We listened for a while before returning to sleep.  At 3:10 am we were woke up again.  We listened for a while, heard nothing, and went back to bed.  In the morning Jennie told us what happened to them in the camper.  At 1:35 am she was woke up not by the raccoon on the picnic table, but by something large walking in the woods behind camp.  She heard us scare away the raccoon and whatever was in the woods walked off.  At 3:10 am something started to shake the camper.  She said the camper was moved back and forth 3 times.  Her reaction was to laugh out loud from inside the camper.  She laughed because Sara and Hagen were sleeping through the event.  The shaking stopped and she heard something retreat back into the woods.",
