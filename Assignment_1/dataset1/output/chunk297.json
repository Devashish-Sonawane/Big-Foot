The land is flat and laid off into square sections of land. Occasionally a stream interrupting the square sections of land. The streams are the only place you will find trees with the exception around the houses and machine sheds. There are wheat fields after wheat fields.  Other crops grown there such as sunflowers. I have tried counting wild turkeys. There would be as many as 200 in a flock feeding in the stubbed fields.  There are plenty of deer, some pheasant, rabbits, coon, lots of small rodents. I don\u0092t believe there are caves there.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met the witness at the Missouri '08 Expedition and kept in touch with him over the years. He\u0092s a 60 year-old bigfoot researcher in the southern Missouri area who has more than one location he has cultivated. He is a sound researcher and has a good balance of skepticism and analysis.The area is not remote, but is sparsely populated. Farms and homes are spaced off every 1/2 mile. Most of the properties are wheat farms with multiple \u00bc mile square plots. The area is mostly a \"stiff collared German community\" that is protective of their privacy. The witness felt it was unlikely a \u0093jokester\u0094 was doing the knocking because of the reclusive nature of the properties and people\u0092s tendency to keep to themselves. The terrain in the general area is relatively flat and varies by 10 \u0096 20 feet. The overall area fluctuates up to 50\u0092. There is a 3\u0092 deep creek to the west of the property that snakes through the whole area. The creek is recessed 7\u0092 from the surrounding fields. On both sides of the creek trees and vegetation are green and lush. Otherwise, the general area is void of any wooded areas and very few trees.On Thanksgiving night at 9:30 p.m., the witness took a 3' long, 2 x 4 like shaped dry oak and struck it twice against a debarked dead pecan tree. Five minutes later there was one single knock reply 350 yards to the west in the creek area. Five minutes later, standing near the porch of the house, he smelled a very strong odor that seemed to be coming from the south of his position. He isn\u0092t sure how close the source of the smell was but it had to be relatively close because there was no wind that night. There are farm utility buildings and farm implements to the south of the witness\u0092 position and something could have easily gotten close to him without him hearing it sneak up. While the smell was still strong he went to the backdoor and called his wife outside, by the time she got on the porch the odor was dissipating but she was able to smell it too. The odor lasted for about a minute.Five minutes later he did a howl and almost immediately a coyote from the south came running from a couple of hundred yards away, yelping and howling all the way. It stopped next to the granary building 40 yards to the straight south of the witness and yelped at them. The coyote stopped south of where the smell came from but was further away. Four minutes later, 60 yards to the northwest next to a utility building his wife heard 3 very low growl/moans that lasted a few seconds. She could tell it was something very different from a coyote or anything else. The witness didn\u0092t hear them because his hearing is bad at certain frequencies. The next night at 9:40 p.m., with his son-in-law present, he did four knocks with the same log and same tree as the night before. Nothing happened for five minutes and he went over to where his son-In-law was listening. He did a holler and within 10 seconds a knock came from the same location as the night before, 350 yards to the west. They waited 45 minutes before they decided nothing was going to happen and went inside. In summation: What the witness experienced isn\u0092t something someone would expect in western Oklahoma. The land is flat with very few areas of cover and wooded tracts.  Because of the secluded nature of farm properties and peoples\u0092 knack to keep to themselves, it is highly unlikely a person would be out on Thanksgiving night doing wood knocks from a creek bed on someone\u0092s property. And it\u0092s physically impossible for coyotes to do wood knocks.The witness felt as a result of doing a howl, the coyote came running to him because it though it was one of his \u0093buddies\u0094.I mentioned to the witness that I\u0092ve read accounts of people describing the unknown odor they\u0092ve smelled as \u0091human sewage mixed with rotten meat\u0092 like he did. I asked him if he\u0092s read accounts of people describing the odor that way. He said no, that\u0092s just what it smelled like.Click here to hear the howl the witness did. This howl was recorded on a different day.The image below highlights the spots where events occurred.They're listed in sequence of events.  \u2022 Initial knock by witness spot  \u2022 Return knock area by unknown subject  \u2022 Porch area.

Witness' wife hears growl, witness & wife are near porch-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note from Editor Matt Moneymaker:I was one of the first (if not the first) person to make the connection (and write about) the knocking behaviors of sasquatches, back in the mid 1980's, after hearing them for myself. Since then I have heard authentic sasquatch wood knocks, during expeditions, in several parts of North America -- probably more than any other person.  With that said, I can tell you it is important to differentiate between a woody \"tap\" sound and a true wood knock by a sasquatch.If we can consider humans a native species in North America, then we can say only two native species can make true 'wood-on-wood' knock sounds  -- humans and sasquatches -- but some other species can make loud tap sounds.  Ravens can make tap sounds with their throats, and will sometimes answer man-made wood knocks with their own tap-like sounds. In the Pacific Northwest I have seen squirrels respond to human-made knock sounds by dropping pine cones off conifer trees.  A dropping pine cone usually strikes a lower branch and often produces a fairly loud tap sound. Both ravens and PNW squirrels can sometimes be coaxed into replying to knock sounds, but I've only heard that in the daylight ... never after dark. One needs to have an excellent ear to distinguish a tap from a distant knock. Knocks are usually powerful sounds that humans would have trouble replicating with natural implements.  Whereas taps have a lower volume and level of force.  These characteristics are quite subjective, though, especially when the sound is coming from a distance.",
