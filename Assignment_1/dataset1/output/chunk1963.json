            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the reporting party (RP) by telephone the same evening his report was submitted.  He advised that the incident had occurred about 20 hours earlier, around midnight the night before. Two days later, AZ BFRO Investigators Tim Zamiski, Sandra McLemore, and I met at the location with the RP and his son, who was with his father when the encounter took place.  The two showed us exactly where the incident occurred and took us step-by-step through what happened, and the following can be added:- The rocks were thrown from the top of a small vertical cliff about twenty feet above them, crashing through the tree branches overhead and landing with a loud crash in a rocky area on the far side of the creek. By the sound they made when they landed, the RP believed that the rocks were likely somewhat larger than softball-sized. They did not actually see the rocks, as the only light was from their small flashlights. They did see tree foliage moving, probably the result of the rocks crashing through.- They did not see the creature that ran away through the creek, again probably due to the limited light from their flashlights. They did see bushes moving, and heard it splashing through the water and running over the rocks on the far side of the creek. They said from the sound it was clearly bipedal.  - The creekbed is very rocky in this area, with thousands of round \u0093river rocks\u0094 of all sizes, so it was not possible to figure out which rocks were the ones that were thrown, or exactly where they had landed. There was evidence of broken branches in the trees overhead, and some marks on the bark of larger overhead branches was noted that could be consistent with being hit by the rocks.- The top of the small cliff was lined with large clumps of brush, which would prevent any person or animal from coming within approximately eight feet of the edge. This would also prevent anything from being seen from directly below. We located the most logical point where something would have been standing when the rocks were thrown, and found possible footprints, although they were of poor definition due to the type of soil substrate.  The size of the prints indicated that the rock-thrower was likely a juvenile. In two nearby locations, depressions in the ground were found where rocks had been laying, which may have been from the rocks that were thrown. It would have been highly unlikely, if not impossible, for a human to be able to throw rocks of that size, that distance. Based on the interviews and the investigation, this incident appears to be consistent with known Bigfoot behaviors, and the location is in an area with a history of prior Bigfoot activity. This creek area sees heavy recreation use during the day, but is closed to overnight camping. It thus seems logical that any visiting Bigfoots would not expect to find humans there at midnight. No vocalizations of any kind were heard.The RP in this incident is a retired police officer, who is a life-long hunter and outdoorsman, and who I found to be well-spoken and very credible. He has a good basic knowledge of Bigfoot behavior, and had a previous incident in September, 2007, report 21535. His knowledge allowed him to immediately recognize what was happening, and his decision to have the group quickly leave the area when confronted by aggressive territorial behavior was absolutely the correct thing to do. By submitting his report as soon as he did, and agreeing to meet with investigators, it gave us the opportunity to conduct an on-site investigation within 36 hours of the incident. And although the physical evidence found was not very distinct, a heavy rainstorm two days later no doubt destroyed it completely. I had originally planned and came equipped to do a night investigation here, but the location did not seem to be a place where Bigfoots could be found every night. They probably only pass through occasionally, and the RP\u0092s group just happened to be there at the right time.   ",
