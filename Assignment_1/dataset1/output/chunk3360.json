            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness for approximately 40 minutes. When I asked him how he could differentiate between the creature that he encountered vs. a bear, he stressed the animal's human-like movement when it turned to face him. He said that he was under the distinct impression that it was analyzing him in a very human-like manner. The color was described as a dark brown with a reddish tint, and the length of the arms compared to that of a bear were significantly longer. The witness was adamant that \"it was not a bear, and it was not a person\", but some kind of animal not known to people. [Editor's Notes (MM):]Hamburg, New Jersey, is a hilly, heavily forested, rural corner of the state near the Delaware Water Gap. This part of Jersey is much more like Pennsylvania than the Jersey that most Jersey people live in.A railroad bed runs through Hamburg. This railroad bed runs near a handful of large golf courses.  The relevancy of those factors:  Bigfoots are occasionally spotted on or near golf courses that are frequented by herds of deer at night.  In the midwest and eastern states, sightings and track finds often occur near railroad beds -- usually abandoned railroad beds, but not always. It is suspected that bigfoots may sometimes use railroad beds at night to walk to habitation/feeding areas near those routes.",
