            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness attended one of my Bigfoot lectures and volunteered to tell her story. After a face to face interview and comparing her story to a former investigator's interview with her from like 25 years ago, I'm very convinced of her sighting. We asked the witness if we could come to her home for an onsite interview. She agreed and we met up with her a few weeks later. Myself, Ray Gardner, and master tracker Randall Coyote did a full onsite reenactment of the incident. After walking the property and seeing where the unknown biped was initially seen, we followed its path down a decline towards the creek bed to where it jumped into the creek. To our amazement, the jump down was an easy 14 feet down to the creek bed. The 14 ft drop down into the beginning of the creek ravine:The biped was not seen again because it made its way towards the Black River going deeper and deeper into the creek ravine, obviously trying to get as far away from their home and into the woods. Once the exact path was determined, the witness and I went back up the hill and into her home. Once in the same spot looking out the kitchen window from where she saw the biped in 1985, we had Randall, who's 6' 4\", walk the same exact route that the hairy biped did. The first thing she said was \"wow....the thing that I saw was much larger than Randall and covered the same space at a much faster rate of travel.\" Her initial impression when she saw the creature was that it was roughly 6 1/2 to 7 ft tall. After seeing Randall walk the same pathway to the creek, she realized that it was much taller and much thicker than it appeared that day. We came to an height estimate between 7 1/2 and 8 ft tall. She said it never looked in her direction or even look back at the dogs as it fled. Due to the steepness of the creek valley, it appears that when she brought the dogs out, the creature was forced by the dogs barking to head down the decline to the safest place to enter the creek ravine, avoiding a 40 to 60 ft drop off. The witness pointing in the direction that the hairy biped was heading:They had just moved into the home within the month and after the incident have never seen anything since. The area today is now highly developed even though their home still sits in, way off the road in a beautiful wooded valley abutting a very large Metro-park system. Beautiful hardwood forests surround the property and creek valley:",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness for nearly 2 hours regarding this incident. She has lived on the 130 acres of property since the mid 1970's, and is quite well versed as to the sights and sounds of wildlife. There have been other incidents in the past, and she had related these to her older daughter (not the younger one present at this occurrence), and she was met with avid skepticism from her. She works for the government, and is very meticulous and precise with her recollections, as would be required in a government position. She was also raised by a military parent, so her observations of nature, and life in general, are precise. Previous experiences will not be delved into here, as they are distant, though probably relevant to her recent report. Witness is articulate, educated, and in tune with her surroundings.The extreme drought of this past summer did not affect the water supply on her property, (spring fed?) thus creating a better support system for food sources. Also the lay of the land is caves, many hills and valleys, heavy woods, and creeks which all merge in various places on her property. As stated in her original report, she was almost positive as to what it was, yet did not indicate her assumption to her daughter. I asked her to try and describe the vocalizations she heard. She explained, \"It was two parts consecutively. There was a short whoop, like the woman's scream that lasted about a second and a half then a pause then it cut loose with a really long deep howl. That was the gut wrenching howl that sent me, my daughter and the dog in the house. It was up close and personal in the wood line about 250 feet away.\"They did listen to BFRO recorded sounds, Sierra sounds, and other sources before both coming to the conclusion as to what they heard.
