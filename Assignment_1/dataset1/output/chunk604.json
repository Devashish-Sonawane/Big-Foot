            "Follow-Up Report": "I first spoke with this witness by phone then arranged a meeting with him. After that meeting we arranged to visit the location of his sighting. In the interim I made a cardboard representation of what he reported so we could more accurately gauge the height of the creature while on-site.On July 6th we visited the location. The area is very familiar to me as I have camped and fished there for over 50 years. I have seen deer, bear, and all manner of small fuzzy creatures there. The area holds a lot of food sources including the aforementioned plus mushrooms, salmon berries, red huckleberries, skunk cabbage, and numerous edible mosses and lichens. There are rivers, creeks, and ponds in the vicinity. The woods range from old (early 1900\u0092s) replant, to more recent timber sale areas and later replant.Photo 1 shows an intersection. The road to the right is where the creature was first sighted and the road straight ahead and uphill is the location of the second sighting, after the witness ran back to camp to get his friend. For both sightings, the witness was standing near the juncture of the two roads.Photo 2 shows the re-creation of the first sighting.  The witness only saw the glowing yellow eyes and the red reflector on the gate being blocked. The mock-up was raised up to this point where the witness indicated his recounting of the height. The measurement to the top of the \u0093head\u0094 is 10\u0092 1\u0094. The distance between the witness and the creature was measured at 103\u0092.Photo 3 shows where the witness saw the creature upon returning with his friend, an estimated 2 minutes later. They looked down the road to the location of the first sighting, but were dismayed to not see the creature. As they turned, they looked up the hill and the witness could see the creature on the road, where it began walking toward them.  The distance between the witness and the creature on the second sighting was approximately 150\u0092. Per the witness, this is an accurate re-creation of his second sighting. The measurement to the top of the head was again 10\u00921\u0094 and the mass was also stated as accurate.The witness has spent most of his life in the outdoors, camping and fishing whenever he has the time. He is familiar with all manner of animal life common to Washington State. The specifics of his encounter are without variation at each telling. Further, he exhibited the appropriate physical and emotional reactions to the re-creation of his encounter. I believe the witness had the good fortune to encounter a bigfoot twice at close range. I wonder how close the encounter could have been if the witness had not fled when the creature walked toward him!",

            "Observed": "Dear BFRO,I have viewed your site, it is very good, it gave me guts to tell my story.  I have never told anyone what happened to me in 1994, I was afraid people would consider me nuts. I was fishing on Escambia river on the Alabama, Florida line. The water was high from alot of rain, the swamps were flooded which made for good bass fishing. It was almost sundown, I noticed that everything was quiet, the frogs, birds, crickets,ect...I heard water spashing, I thought it was a deer leaping through the water but what I spotted was a two legged animal walking upright through shallow water and trees. It saw me and started wading toward me.  The water got deeper, almost to it's chest, it turned away and went back to shallow water.  It watched me for a couple of minutes and wandered back into the swamp. It never made a sound, but it tilted its head back and forth like it was trying to figure me out during the time it watched me..I have sinced purchased a camcorder, but I haven't seen it again..the one I saw, I would guess it was about six to six and one half feet tall.  It was a dark tan in color but had a little black around it's shoulders.  Its hair covered most of its body, but it had bare places on its face and elbows.  I would guess it came within 75 yards of me.  I was stunned and very scared. As soon as it was out of site, I left as soon as my motor would start..I often wonder what would have happened if I would have been in shallow water...it did not act as if it was going to attack. To me, it looked as if it was in dispair...there is a lot more to my story, but I'm not a very good typist..thanks...(Name omitted by BFRO)",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness had about a 4 minute view of the animal.   Although he fishes the area often and sometimes at night, he has never seen anything before.  He did relate an experience as a teen while fishing off a nearby bridge over a creek.  It involved loud vocalizations and shaking of trees and bushes and caused he and his friends to run home in terror.The witness later appeared on OLN TV's \"Mysterious Encounters\" and gave his testimony on camera.  He has been consistent in his story.  I also video taped this witness telling his story to another witness (near the sighting location) who had plaster casts of footprints from Berrydale, south of Brewton, Alabama.  These two came across with sincerity.The nearest towns are actually Pollard and Flomaton in Alabama and neighboring Century across the line in Florida.   The area in question was the site of a documented sighting report by a truckload of workers of a similar animal.  There are oil operations in the area and a hunt club which restricts access by the public.This flood-plain area is full of scrub and larger trees including cypress and is extremely thick, while rich in wildlife and a variety of plant types.  It also connects via the river to much more expansive forested areas.Also, since this report was made, I have talked with a teenager who was driving an ATV in this area on hunt club land on a rainy day.  He turned his head while stopped at a dirt road crossroads in time to see something tall, dark and hairy sprint across the road nearby at an extreme rate of speed. ",
