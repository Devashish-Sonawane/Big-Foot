In the single daylight observation description I have from the witness, she was told  (by her mother who is not living anymore) it was very large and reddish and was seen eating raspberries. She mentioned to me that her sister was very much afraid of staying in the house and had been hearing things out her window.  In time, after taking her sister's place in the house, it became evident that \"someone\" was out there.  Glimpses were all anyone got except the good look by her mother and I was told her brothers must have seen it.  There will be some more interviews done here which should shed some more substantial information on this particular report.",
