            "Observed": "I was traveling up copper creek near Ashford Washington in my off roader doing a snow run to test out my new knuckle I put in. It was about 4pm and as I was turning a corner, I saw a large hairy biped creature cross in front of me and go up the bank to my right. I stopped and watched for a moment before it had disappeared into the forest. I kept an eye out the rest of the trip, but didn't see anything else. While parked at the top, I heard distinct wood knocks. They sounded less than a mile off, but sound can carry well in the mountains.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This event took place on March 1st approximately 4 PM. The witness was testing a repair to his off road vehicle. There was a lot of snow there, so it was slow going. He drove up Copper Creek Road about 4 miles, and when he came around a corner and saw what he described as an oversized gorilla cross the road and go up a hill to his right. He said that it walked through 3-4 feet of snow like it was effortless. He watched it as it disappeared into the forest. Upon further questioning, I was able to determine the most likely location via Google Earth and his description of where he was. I was well acquainted with this location as I had cut a Christmas tree there about 12 years ago. The witness described the creature as having rusty-brown hair. The hair on the arms was long at the elbows. The hair on the back and shoulders was also long. He said that the hair at the top of the head was pointed. It was estimated to be 8 \u00bd - 9 feet tall. It walked with a loping gait, which I interpret as long strides. He said that it never turned to look at him, and it just kept on going.The witness drives an older SUV that he uses just for snow and mud. This is common in this area, and a popular spot for such activities. He said that it is loud, so this creature had to know he was coming.He made his way on up to the top of the ridge, several more miles distant. At the top he heard wood knocks that he estimated to be a mile away, coming from the west. This is commonly heard in this area. I know of several other people who have reported hearing wood knocks from this spot. It will be a great place to go to as soon as the snow allows safe travel. The view is great, and the ability to hear will be spectacular as it is away from any main highways.Two weeks had passed before the witness and I managed to talk. During that time, there had been a lot of snow melt, and then subsequent additional snow layers. A site visit at that time was not possible and there would have been no evidence to observe by then.",
