            "Observed": "It happened like this. Myself and a friend were out on the edge of the woods. We had decided that we would build a blind for hunting squirrels. On the way in we spotted a dead tree. We both tried to push it over, even worked together, but couldn't so we went back to work. Awhile later we heard the tree start to crack then it was smashed to the ground. We didn't get a good look at it but what we saw I would estimate between 7 - 8 ft tall. There other things that have happened back there as well. I have been howled at and had rocks thrown at me.",

I spoke with his parents and made an appointment to visit the area.I spent approximately ninety minutes walking through the woods that adjoin his home. It was an area with large thickets and lots of brush and trees. This area is traversed by railroad tracks.  The following details can be added to the report:- The two boys had been working on a \"fort\" when they saw the animal standing close by.- The animal was hair covered, and was estimated to weigh about 250 lbs.- The shoulders were broad, and the animal appeared to have no neck.- The animal was black in color, and upright.- The boys quickly retreated from the area and ran to their houses.",
