            "Observed": "My son and I were hiking near Lake Ann in the Northern Cascades around 6:00 pm on Sat. Sep. 6, 2014. We were in a little cirque just down the trail from Lake Ann. From the bluff high above us (to our northwest) to a crag on the other side of the highway (to our east), there was a weird vocal exchange going on for 5-10 minutes. It weren't no bird. It wasn't a wolf howl... I'm trying to recall. It was rather high pitched, but it also varied... there were a variety of sounds. Two bear had been sighted up the trail at Lake Ann itself, but we didn't see them.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and her son were on their way up to the lake when they heard the eerie exchange of calls.  It was raining and they had a late start for their hike, so they heard the vocalizations in the evening.  Since the calls lasted around 10 minutes, the witness felt the two callers were \u0093talking\u0094 back and forth.  Her adult son (age 22) wondered what was making the calls, saying those aren\u0092t people or birds.  They met two hikers coming down from the lake who also questioned, \u0093What could that be?\u0094  Within about 10 seconds of hearing the high pitched and varied calls, the witness knew where the callers were located.  She was certain one individual was on the ridge above them, which put it at an elevation of around 6600 feet.  The other was across the valley on top of a mountain, at an elevation of about 7790 feet.  The line-of-sight distance between those two points is two miles.  The witness and her son were in an open area of the slope below the ridge, approaching another forested section at the time.  Their location was at an elevation of around 5200 feet.  They continued up to the lake, but didn\u0092t spend much time there before returning by nightfall.  The experience made an impression on the witness and she wondered if those calls were made by Bigfoot.",
