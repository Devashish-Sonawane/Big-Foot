Doug suddenly burst into the house, scared and wild-eyed.  \"Bigfoot! Bigfoot!\"- he came in yelling. \"Bigfoot ran us off!\" Doug was always very brave and I had never seen him scared like that in my life.  He had a shotgun with him, but he said he didn\u2019t shoot it because he was afraid it would kill him if he did, so he ran.",
