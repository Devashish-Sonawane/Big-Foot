He drew us a picture and explained a little: The creatures were up a hill with the sun coming up behind them. They looked white from the distance he and his friend saw them from.Walked to site and photographed. Walked to area where nests were reported and photographed. While at nests we heard something retreat away, uphill, bipedally. Ground shook, very dark, tried to follow. Found big pile of branches in middle of dirt road. Found two possible tracks. Found possible bed, vegetation still rising. Whatever we heard move away seemed to have come from here.",
