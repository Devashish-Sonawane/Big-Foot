We were traveling south bound just from the on ramp. We saw a very large figure crossing the rail road tracks. It was probably 8' or 8 1/2' tall. It moved gracefully across the rail road tracks. At first I thought it was a man dressed up in a dark brown fur suit. Some one said, \"Did you see that?\"",

This couple showed a lot of interest in the still picture of the Patterson/Gimlin film.  I asked them if they had seen something like that, and they both responded in the affirmative.  I had them sit down for an interview and requested they submit their story to our web page, which they did.  They had not spoken to anyone about this up until that time and did not want any attention brought to them if they were to report it.  The BFRO policy is to honor requests for privacy.  RC is an elk deer hunter and has seen a good number of bear and stated flatly, \"This was definitely not a bear.\" ",
