My immediate thought with respect to the sound was that it was a bobcat. I froze in my tracks and looked toward the sound in time to see whatever it was jump from about 6 or 8 feet up in a tree to the ground. It landed on its hind legs, took 3 or 4 steps, then went to all fours and ran faster than I have ever seen anything run into the treeline. When I saw that it was completely gone, I ran as fast as I could perpendicularly to the highway.",

            "Observed": "I saw a Big Foot when my aunt, cousins and parents were camping at our property.  We had a fire blazing and we kept hearing these strange noises, branches breaking and thumps.   After about an hour of this, I was wondering what might be lurking in the woods.   So I went over to the area where I heard the noises to see what it was;  I went about 10 yards from the fire.  All of a sudden, something about waist high ran very fast in front of me.   To this day I don\u0092t know what it was; I turned and about nine feet away I saw an eight foot creature staring at me.   I did not get any facial details.  I was too far away from the fire.  I could tell that its head had a point on top.  It stared at me for about 10 seconds, but it felt like 10 minutes.  Then it did this slow turn away from me and walked away.  I ran back into the cabin and I did not come out for the rest of the night.  I did not tell anyone right away, because I thought it might have been a trick on me (played by my cousins).   Six months later my parents and I found a 15 inch footprint alongside the pond at our property, when we were fishing near the area of my sighting.  We took pictures of the footprint.   About two years after my sighting my Dad and I were camping out at our land, the same area, and me and my Dad heard a knock.  The next day I found a 20 inch footprint.  I had a camera with me and I took pictures of that footprint.   I have no doubt that there is a Sasquatch that has been living around our property. And I think it might still live there.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This report is a duplicate with 43880.On April 9, 2014, after exchanging emails with the parents and speaking first with his dad on the phone, I talked to the 11-year-old witness about his encounter and possible track find six months later.  My conversation with the boy witness was great.  He was very articulate and passionate about his experience.  It's reasonable to question the credibility of any witness and especially a boy who was maybe 9 or 10 when these events happened.  He gave me no reason to suspect he was making up stories.  Plus, the events can be validated to some degree by his parents who were with him at the campfire and heard the same things the boy did.  Parents were also with the witness when the track was found.In our conversation, he described how he walked away from a family campfire at about 10:30 pm to investigate strange knocks and tree branch break sounds they all had been hearing.  He expected it was a deer and wanted to see it.  Something waist-high and dark that he apparently almost stepped on dashed away very quickly left to right drawing his attention to the right where he saw a tall, bipedal creature with broad shoulder outline and glowing red eyes standing there motionless, silently staring at him.  He said the stare down lasted about 10 seconds, then it made this slow, weird turn and just walked away through grass two feet high making no sound whatsoever...no steps heard or grass or trees making noise as it moved away.  He emphasized, \"I couldn't believe what I was seeing...it was huge.\"  He said he was really scared and couldn't speak. In the low light witness could not perceive facial detail.  There was no bad smell noticed.I received pictures of a 15-inch track the witness and his parents found near a pond on their property six months later.  Witness' foot shown in the picture is 8.5 inches long and his hand is 6.5 inches long and 4 inches wide.   ",
