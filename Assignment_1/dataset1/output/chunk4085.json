            "Observed.1  ": "Mary Meaux The Port Arthur News PORT NECHES \u0097 Chill bumps rise on David Arceneaux\u0092s arms as he looked across Block Bayou at a line of trees about 100 yards away. \u0093I\u0092m not crazy. I don\u0092t do drugs and I\u0092m not a drinker,\u0094 Arceneaux said before telling his tale of seeing not one but two Bigfoot-like creatures huddled together one December morning. The Nederland native visits Oak Bluff Cemetery about once a month to clean the graves of a friend and a cousin, something he has done for years without incident. But on an overcast, windless day Arceneaux got the fright of his life. \u0093I heard a blood curdling scream and a lady nearby asked me if I was OK. I told her it wasn\u0092t me,\u0094 Arceneaux said as he stood, uneasily, at roughly the same spot where he saw the creatures. \u0093We walked over to the water and looked to the left then straight ahead.\u0094 What he saw next amazed him. Two Bigfoot-like creatures who had been throwing rocks in the water looked across at him and the unknown female. One was standing next to a tree, arms around the trunk and the other was squatted down. As the second creature rose from the crouching position Arceneaux estimated the creature was about eight-foot tall. So he snapped a photo with his phone, he said. \u0093All of a sudden they started walking then running through the woods,\u0094 he said of the bipedal creatures. \u0093When they began to run, the lady said \u0091I\u0092m leaving\u0092 and left. I stayed a few more seconds and then thought there may be a way for them to cross here so I left, scared.\u0094 Arceneaux said he could see the face of the creature \u0093clear as day.\u0094 There was hair from the mouth down like a man and when the creature turned he could see hair hanging down its arm. Disturbed by what he saw, Arceneaux went home and watched an episode of \u0093Finding Bigfoot\u0094 but had to change the channel when they played an audio recording of Bigfoot \u0097 it was too real. \u0093This is my first time back here since December,\u0094 he said. Arceneaux said he spoke to a game warden, describing the situation, and was told there had been other sightings along the Neches River. Calls placed to a local game warden was not returned by Tuesday afternoon. There are a number of organizations throughout the state that researches and documents Bigfoot sightings. Groups such as Texas Bigfoot Research Conservancy and Gulf Coast Bigfoot Research Organization. These groups strive to find evidence to scientifically prove the existence of the creature. Jerry Hestand of Texas Bigfoot Research Conservancy said there have been reports of sightings in the Big Thicket area and he has had personal experiences at the Lance Rosier Unit in the Thicket. Hestand said one of the creatures entered his camp and growled at one of the dogs. The dog, he said, growled back but by the time the men jumped up from their tents the creature was gone. Hestand said the group was part of an episode of a Travel Channel show called Weird Travels in which Bigfoot vocalizations were played. \u0093There is a sound on the Internet called the Ohio howl,\u0094 Hestand said. \u0093That\u0092s exactly what we heard clearly and distinctly.\u0094 Arceneaux said he did not come forward with his story sooner because he worried about what others would think of him. He has shown this photographic evidence \u0097 which was taken at a far distance with a cell phone \u0097 to friends and family and only had one person scoff. He will continue to research Bigfoot, he said, but remains wary of returning to the spot where the encounter occurred.
