            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness, a retired police officer in his mid-sixties, describes a bi-pedal creature leisurely crossing the road at a distance of approximately 100 yards at a 45 degree angle across a county road on his way home from his cabin back to Green Bay.  Upon turning the corner, the subject escaped into a nearby ditch. When stopped, the witness was not able to gain further visual, auditory, or olfactory evidence.  Given the time of year, the conditions of the environment, and the color of the animal, the ability to blend into the environment for an animal is evident.  He reports a subject of approximately 6'-6 1/2' in height with very broad shoulders and an estimated weight of nearly 300 pounds.  A conical head and long arms are also reported.  While the witness was not able to view its lower arms, he indicates they did appear to be longer than typical for a human. The subject was brown to dark brown in color.  Sunshine gave it a  a \"gold\" appearance.  The hair was described as 2-3\" in length.  I have investigated the area on three different occasions and note that the area is vastly wooded, harbors many bodies of water both in the form of lakes and rivers, and is a heavily hunted area due to the abundance of deer, wolves, bear and other animals.   In addition, the number of reports coming from this general area make this area a viable area for considerable exploration.  The Northern area of Wisconsin is very remote, consists of mainly state and national forests, and has limited human population.",
