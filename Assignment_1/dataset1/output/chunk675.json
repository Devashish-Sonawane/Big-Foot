The witness stated  it was a very loud, rumbling, bassy scream. He later heard a vocalization on the internet from Kentucky, and said it sounded exactly like the one he heard.  He said it gave him the chills. He also had his mother listen to it. I have been to the location of the scream which is on the least used side of the lake, backed up by a steep, heavily wooded 5000' - 6000' ridge that leads back to Glacier Peak Wilderness.  Many stories have been told all over this area.",
