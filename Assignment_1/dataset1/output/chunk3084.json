            "Observed": "My husband was outside our apartment building on the outskirts of town, when he heard what seemed to be something very large and heavy running through our backyard by the fenceline. He came into the house and told me about it. About ten minutes later, I went outside, and I saw something that looked very large and hairy moving in the shadows in my barn. My three dogs were barking up a storm and suddenly stopped. I went back into the house. The next night, my husband heard it once again, but this time it was right outside our bedroom window. He saw a shadow move across outside, and our window is about 9 foot off the ground on the second story. He could see from it's shoulders up. It had a dome-like head. He then heard it make its way around the house torwards the bean field across the street. It let out a moan-like cry that just sent chills down his spine. The following two nights, us and a couple friends from out of town were outside playing hide-and-seek on our property when we heard strange noises again. My husband and his friend went to investigate the noises, and came running back to the house. It was only 50 yards away hiding between two large silos. It had goldish eyes that reflected light like a deer's. There seemed to be another one just like it only a little smaller with it the last night it was spotted. We've heard it every night for about 5 nights now, and have grown accustomed to hearing it and seeing it. It's not really frightening, but it is intimidating because of it's size and our lack of knowledge as to what exactly it is.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken with this witness several times as this sighting is within a mile from where I now live. He is a very credible witness. Witness was still hunting for deer at mid-afternoon. He was concealed at the waters edge on the south east side of Benton Lake off Big Cypress Bayou above Caddo Lake, when he noticed movement out of the side of his eye. Witness observed an animal in the motion of standing up from a crouched position, standing in approximately 1 foot of water. Animal then looked from side to side and walked out of the water and disappeared into the woods. Animal was standing and walking on two feet. Animal did not notice him as he was well camouflaged and off to the side at about 50 yards. Witness got to observe animal for what seemed like two minutes as it looked around and walked off. Animal appeared to be 6 feet tall, covered with hair from head to toe. It appeared to be black in color but was in the shadows of trees and had no direct sunlight on it. Witness could not make out facial details. Being alone and somewhat startled, he did not go to look at the place where animal walked out of the water but left the scene. On his way back to his truck he did see one very large footprint in some loose soil. Witness is 29 years old. He has hunted this area all his life, has heard many stories of Bigfoot and has heard many unexplained noises, seen many possible foot prints but this is his only actual sighting. This sighting is only 1/4 mile from another sighting during winter of 2001 by one of our locals that will not go public with his sighting, and is 3/4 mile from where I had and encounter (no actual sighting) with a possible Bigfoot, also during winter of 2001.
