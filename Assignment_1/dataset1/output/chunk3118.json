We were camping with a few other families and the tents were basically in a circle.  As I passed the tent next to mine there was what i take to be a young bigfoot (about my height, which is 5'7\") I would call it grayish brown, not like an ape, the facial features were flatter, more like a person's (not the big jaw an ape has). I stopped dead in my tracks and it stared at me and I stared at it. It frightened me since I didn't expect to see it but it never moved, giving me the impression it was just as scared. I went back to the fire and it disappeared.",

Her husband measured the height of the window and she has revised her estimate of the creature's height closer to 8 feet tall. ",
