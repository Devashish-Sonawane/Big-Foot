            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness on the phone, and she recounted her experience without missing a beat. It had obviously been a very significant and memorable event. Area along bank of east fork of Des Moines River where log was tossed:Witness added a few important details. The log that was thrown into the water landed about 7 feet from shore. The log was about five feet long. She said that the thrower of  the log had a good vantage point for watching her on the bridge. The area where the log was tossed is wooded with large and small trees, and it would have been easy for an animal to hide or blend in. The log looked as though it had been lying on the ground for some time.I asked her why she stated that what threw the log was a male even though she didn't see him, the witness stated that she had the strong intuitive feeling that what she was encountering was a male. I asked if she was intuitive about things and she said that she always has been. She also felt strongly that it was curious as to why she was there, that it wanted her to leave, and that it didn't mean her any harm.A week later this witness stopped at the bridge and had the same 'watched' feeling. I found the witness to be very credible. This incident occurred at a major fork in the Des Moines River, near its northern extent. Many other possible bigfoot related incidents have been reported near this portion of the Des Moines River Valley.",

            "Observed": "I was alone hunting mule deer. I had been hiking for about 45 minutes to get to the spot where I had the encounter. I was sitting on a ridge between to rows of rimrock, looking into a draw that comes up the south side of Hodges Canyon. I bent over to retie a bootlace when I was startled by an extremely loud noise of short duration. I didn't have any idea what the noise was. Then I heard it again. I would describe it as a low pitched, guttural shout/growl. The volume and resonance were incredibly loud, but of short duration (about 1 to 1 1/2 seconds). I heard the vocalization about 7 to 10 times, at about 10 second intervals. Then I heard twigs breaking and brush popping, moving rapidly in my direction, just like an elk or moose was running toward me.I never saw anything, but I fully expected the animal I was hearing to come into view immediately. As the unseen creature moved toward me, I took the point and shoot camera from my backpack. I also released the safety on my .270 rifle. The distance at which I heard the first vocalization was about 200 yards. The closest point was only about 75 yards.",
