Christmas Florida on Fort Christmas Road and went down a smaller road and were driving looking and it ran out from behind a tree something very large. One of the guys saw its eyes and said they were huge. It ran very fast, we stopped and rolled down window, there was a smell and then we turned around and looked more for it. Off to the right on the road is a wild life preserve. With a lot of power lines and a river called the Econlochahatche River.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On October 19, 2012, late in the night, a school employee and several of his high school students were driving in the Christmas area squatching.  The area is very wooded and rural with nature preserves and several rivers in the area. As they drove down Fort Christmas Road they saw a large man-like figure move from a tree near the road into a pasture at a very fast rate of speed. Three of the five witnesses saw it and described it in a similar way. It was dark in color, bipedal, and extremely fast as it ran toward the tree line. Hair was visible, it appeared short and uniform, and the head was \u0093big.\u0094  One of the witnesses saw silver-ish colored eye shine that appeared more than 8 inches apart. They had pulled over when the figure was first seen and rolled down the windows. A very foul odor was present; described as \u0093rotting garbage.\u0094Google Earth Image of this location:Photo taken at this first sighting location, the tree had two snapped branches at the place where the bigfoot stepped over the fence:After seeing the running creature that night, they decided to go driving again the next night.  Around midnight a little more than a mile from the first encounter, they seemed to have another encounter. Having earlier seen deer, cows and horses as they shinned a high powered light into the passing fields, about 30 feet from the road they saw something different. Once again, the eye shine was silver-ish and wide apart.  As they stopped, they watched the figure get up from a prostrate position, to squatting, then full height which seemed to be over 8 feet high.  The shoulders were very wide and it was \u0093huge.\u0094  They noticed several deer further back behind it and watched it run toward the tree line spooking the deer it may have been stalking.  Google Earth image of this second location:Photo taken at the second sighting location, cows were not in the pasture at the time of the sighting:And as inconceivable as a second sighting is in just as many days is, I met with the witnesses and found them honest and credible while I investigated the sightings. They described and believe they saw a bigfoot on both nights. With further investigation, residents at the first sighting recall a strange and \u0093extremely loud\u0094 scream on or about the night of October 19 which made them discuss what it could possibly have been. Although it resembled a coyote, it was not something they had heard before. They remembered the sound because it was so unusual.A week later Report 36826 came in. That sighting was less than 5 miles away and was described in a similar way.",
