            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness and was able to meet with her at the sighting location.  Her accounts were consistent and believable.  Here is a sketch made by the witness:The following can be added to this report - The hair was six to eight inches long.The hair was dark brown.There were leaves stuck in the hair on the buttocks.The head was very bulky.The huge size of the hands was the most remarkable visual noted by the witness.The right hand held what looked like a rock.  The rock was egg shaped and almost as large in diameter as a bowling ball.  The creature handled the rock as if it were a softball.The creature\u0092s movement was powerful. The estimated height was 7\u0092 6\u0094.The estimated weight was 450+ pounds.This sighting was at sunset.  The witness hit her brakes and horn when she saw the deer sprint full speed across the road.  She had never seen a deer run that fast.  As the car was stopping, she saw the creature coming to a stop near the roads edge.  The headlights started to light up the creature as it turned to its left and walked back into the pine forest.  She slowly drove forward until she was at the point where the creature entered the forest.  Her window was down and she could smell a very strong, musty odor with the power of skunk.  She could also hear the creature making deep, raspy, loud grunts.  When she looked for the source of the grunts she could see the creature about 50 feet inside the wood line facing her car.  These grunt unnerved the witness and she drove home.  I met with the witness the afternoon after the encounter where the sighting took place.  The pine forest was thick with trees from 3\u0094 to 12\u0094 in diameter.  The ground was covered with a thick layer of pine needles so no tracks could be found.  I did find deep scuff marks near the roads edge where she said the deer sprinted across the road.  We stayed road side for about an hour as it started getting dark.  There was a huge storm front moving in and lightning could be seen flashing on the horizon.  I decided to make two quick whoops to see if there would be any response.  Two seconds later there was a faint response that we both heard.  The response was of the same cadence and tone I had used.  We stayed there in the dark for about 20 minutes then left because the storms were getting closeThe witness went back to the site alone 2 days later.  She started to smell the same odor again after about 10 minutes.  The odor started getting stronger after another 2 minutes so she left and did not go back.",

            "Observed": "You have had an encounter with my family, the Bridges over in Quincy, Florida. I now live in jacksonville, Fl. with my boyfriend, his mothers friend has a lake house in Lake Crosby. We took a day trip out there and as we were walking from the end of the dock up to the lake house. It intriged us greatly when we looked to the left and saw a foot print that was not a normal size. We jumped off the dock to get a closer look, it was exactly how a big foot print looks. It was about 11-12 inches long and 5 inches wide. While we were there, there was ducks in the water near shore. The area is very swampy like a marsh, and deserted from a lot of human commotion. Furthermore, my knowledge provokes me to go back to where it was sighted and do further research ourselves. We do believe the area is habitat to big foot. To have your opinion about the situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the gentleman and his girlfriend separately about the footprint they found. The girlfriend is a niece to Mr. & Mrs. Bridges whose habituation in North Florida was a highlight on the television show Finding Bigfoot. Having knowledge of the footprint casts that have been made at her Uncle\u0092s home, they were able to recognize the footprint they found. The fact that their family members experience ongoing encounters at their home leads to the witness\u0092 credibility with this single large print. While visiting a friend\u0092s lake house on Lake Crosby, outside Starke, FL, they noticed a very deep footprint from the dock. The dock starts out over a marshy area before going out in the lake. What they noticed off the dock was a very large, deep print that was about 3 inches larger than his size ten foot. It was about 5 inches wide. The toes were well formed, and it was noticed that the big toe was \u0093three fingers wide.\u0094  They were able to see in the middle of the foot an area that was not so hard packed, thus indicating a transverse tarsel joint. When the man tried to recreate the depth of the print, his own footprint barely sunk into the mud. The footprint they found was of a right foot headed toward the lake.Unfortunately they did not have a camera or phone on them at the time. When they returned to inspect further, the print was gone.The lake is spring fed and very clear. There is abundant fish, mussels, ducks and other food sources.  The west and south ends of this lake are heavily wooded, indicating a likely bigfoot habitat.Lake Cosby:Google Earth Image of the Location:",
