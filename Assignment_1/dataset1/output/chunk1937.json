            "Follow-Up Report": "I communicated with the witness by email first,  in order to receive and examine the photographs he had taken.  We then spoke over the phone and discussed the details of the day he and his friend witnessed the large, crouching animal depart over difficult terrain to evade them.  He described the animal as engaging in a rocking/swaying motion as it appeared to watch them.  The movements of the animal as it retreated were described as graceful, gliding, and fast - a steep hill was negotiated and ascended without effort. Piqued with curiosity,  the witness and his friend walked toward and into the area where the animal had been just moments before.  Several interesting things were found.   Not only were several narrow trees freshly broken several feet off the ground, but within close proximity of them,  a large footprint was discovered.   The two men photographed what they found.  The print was estimated to be nearly sixteen inches long, in comparison to the witness's own foot.  On the scene and several times since this day,  they have discussed and tried to pick apart their experience, but can't dismiss the sheer size, agility and behavior as being one of the more common animals they know to inhabit this area of Missouri. Examining the print,  I would say the estimation of sixteen inches is probably pretty close to correct.   If you zoom into the top area of the print,  possible toe indentations can be seen,  and as the witness pointed out in our phone conversation,  it even appears that mud might have been squished between the toes.  This print,  in my opinion,  would've been good enough to cast and preserve for additional analysis.   Also of note is the debris that litters the middle of the print,  which may indicate the presence of a mid-tarsal break.  The presence of this anatomical feature would explain the lighter degree of pressure and less damage done to the substrate, compared to the obvious deeper impressions near the toes and heel.  The location is also known as the Fuson Conservation Area. The witness is familiar with the area,  and visits throughout the year.   He also hunts nearby, and pays particular attention to deer movements in anticipation of hunting seasons. I found him to be genuinely curious with his questioning for me,  and consistent with the details and events of his experience.  ",
