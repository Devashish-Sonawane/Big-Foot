It was very fresh.  I heard something in the woods out of sight flanking and paralleling me as I walked.  I heard wood knocking noises and rocks being thrown or rolled down into a ravine as I crossed a creek to leave the area.",

It should be noted that the area is void of human presence for the majority of the year except during fall hunting season.  It has been the witness's experience that even during hunting season the area is lightly visited by humans.  Due to the lack of human traffic, the area could provide a safer haven than other areas in the vicinity.  Geographic circumstances (or legal boundaries) that provide relative safe haven from human traffic are not uncommon in reports describing persistent intimidation.During a recent scouting trip to the same area the witness heard a possible vocalization coming from an adjacent valley.  The vocalization was distant and therefore very faint but had a \"siren-like\" quality to it.  The witness also observed that coyotes started to howl and yap as if in response to the sound.",
