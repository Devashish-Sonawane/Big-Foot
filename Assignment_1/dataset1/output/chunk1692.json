            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness on 5-07-08. The animal that was seen was estimated to be 7 1/2 to 8 ft. tall and had very broad shoulders, twice the size of a man. As the two witnesses were running (unknowingly) towards the animal, it turned its head towards them. It had very large pupils reflecting from the flames of the trash barrels, looking at the young men with a yellowish reflection. This witness has since moved but stays in contact with the other witness. This witness seems to be a very convinced and determined young man that is 100% positive on what he had seen.On 5-08-08 I talked to the second witness via phone and except for minor differences, the story stayed the same and the young man seemed quite convinced of what he had experienced.",

We are both experienced hunters, and this sound was unmistakably made by a animal with two legs. We both stood still and listened to the footsteps walk by us. As the sound drew nearer, we became a little nervous. It was almost as though what ever was walking was going to walk right over the dirt mound that separated it from us. Suddenly, the foot steps stopped only a few feet from us. There was an incredible vibration in the air as though it sensed us, and it knew, that we knew it was there. After what seemed like 8-10 minutes it resumed walking away.",
