            "Follow-Up Report": "I called and talked to John and Howard regarding their sighting of a large bipedal animal that they saw near Howard\u0092s cabin in the Crystal Lake Estates on Sept. 22, 2009.  Crystal Lakes Estates are located NW of Fort Collins, CO at an elevation of 8,511 feet.  At 0730 on Tuesday, John was looking out the front door and saw a large upright black animal walking towards him from the north.  It was walking southeast and crossed a dirt road that was on the opposite side of the North Fork of the Cache La Poudre River from the Blackmon cabin.   John thought that the animal had come out of the bushes that lined the river.   After 30 seconds John called his brother, Howard, over to the window to look at the animal.  Just prior to John calling Howard to the window, a propane truck came down the main road and  the animal turned its head towards the truck when it heard it.  With wider strides it moved away from the truck, and uphill towards a small aspen grove.  It continued to look over its shoulder at the truck while it moved away.  For almost 2 minutes, Howard watched the large black animal moving across the white snow.   Howard had a pair of 12x50 binoculars that he gave to John during the last minute before it disappeared into the aspen grove.   Using the binoculars, John saw the animal\u0092s right side as it moved slightly uphill from him. John described the animal as walking like an upright human (bipedal), with short, black hair that wasn\u0092t shaggy or long, 7 to 8 ft tall with a weight at approx. 800 lbs, at least 3 ft wide shoulders that weren\u0092t humped but were bunched with the neck so that it looked like it didn\u0092t have any neck at all, big chested, a narrow 2 ft wide waist and a face like an orangutan.  The animal had a big head with a high forehead but it didn\u0092t have a point on the top, \u0093kinda like a gorilla, kinda like the pictures from the website\u0094.   Its mouth was wide and it had thin lips that weren\u0092t big or pronounced.  Its upper cheeks \u0093were puffed\u0094 and it had a wide, flat nose, not pointy like a human nose.  Its nostrils pointed down, \u0093kinda like humans\u0094.  It had no facial hair, but it did have hair on the bottom of its chin although it was thin.  Howard added that the animal had huge arms that hung low, almost to its knees, and the long arms were swinging when it was moving uphill.  Howard guessed its weight at 450 to 500 lbs.   Howard said that when he first saw it, it was walking with big strides, and they were, \u0093as smooth as they could be.  The animal wasn\u0092t in a hurry, it wasn\u0092t running\u0094.  Now heavily snowing, Howard and John drove to the area above the aspen grove. Howard and John discussed tracking the animal, but didn\u0092t know what they would do if they caught up to it.  \u0093We wouldn\u0092t shoot it, it looked too human\u0094.  John walked down the hill, through the aspen grove to the road below.  John found one good footprint in the grove.  It was 16\u0094 to17\u0094 long, 6.5\u0094 wide and had 5 toes.  John said that the stride length increased after it saw the propane truck and were about 6 to 7 ft apart.  No pictures were taken.  BFRO investigator Dennis Pfohl and I drove to the area 18 days later and found 6 inches of new snow on the ground.  Howard said that the animal was probably 150 yards from the cabin, and John thought it was less than a \u00bc mile.  My Bushnell rangefinder indicated the distance was approximately 250 yards and my GPS determined the distance was .15 mile (264 yards) from the cabin to the aspen grove.  We spent several hours in the aspen grove which was approximately 50 yards wide at the top and very narrow near the lower road.  The grove was also interspersed with spruce.  We walked through it at different levels.  We didn\u0092t find any footprints, hair or obvious signs of an animal passing through that area. We also looked for escape routes above the upper road and checked these areas as well, but found nothing.    ",
