            "Observed": "Me and two other friends were up exploring this logging road near North Bend. We have herd about some weird things and encounters up there so we decided that we were gonna go see what was out there. I can't say I was expecting anything to happen but I was open to the idea of it. As we were driving up, we pulled off and were walking around on a game trail. I located an interesting footprint. I was able to make out toes on the print but I was unable to determine any other features since the print looks a few weeks old but still got a picture (which I still have). So we continued on. We found a road that was washed out so we went on foot about 2 miles in. We first went about half a mile in when all of a sudden a rock was thrown over our heads and landed in front of me. We thought it was very strange and a little creepy. We had some guns which in a way comforted us that we had some sort of protection. So we decided to keep moving. As we walked down this road, we kept hearing movement along the way. We had the feeling that we were being watched. Eventually it started to get dark so we start back to the truck and as we turned around another rock was thrown from behind, landing in front of us. We were very worried and my friend shot 3 warning shots into the air. We started speed walking back and continued to hear movement in the trees. We got back to the truck and got out of there. When we got almost back to pavement, we pulled off and just relaxed. It was night by this time and we were all in the truck.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with \"CL\" by phone, he agreed to meet me at the location of the second event.  We met on May 15th.  \"CL\" was accompanied by \"AJ,\" one of the other witnesses and I had my son along to assist in the investigation.  The third witness, and driver of the vehicle, was unable to attend the meeting.  There were two locations, as described in CL's report, where unusual events occurred.  The first location is actually on the road to the trailhead to Sunday Lake, along Lennox Creek, and the second was roughly 1.5 miles up the North Fork Road from its junction with SE 72nd street.  CL is familiar with reports from the area and has been a frequent visitor to the BFRO website.  The purpose of their trip on April 5th was to see if they could experience any \"bigfoot\" activity.  Late in the afternoon of April 5 the 3 friends drove the 16.3 miles to the Sunday Lake area.  They parked at a washout to the trailhead and were walking up the road when they began hearing the sounds of rocks crashing through the brush and a few landing on the road.  Frightened by this, \"AJ\" fired several shots from the rifle he was carrying as they retreated to their vehicle.  They promptly left and drove south 14.9 miles to the second location, arriving at dark.  This spot is a pull-out to a gated road that is overgrown and clearly hasn't been used in a long time.  While sitting there and discussing where to go and what to do next, they heard something hit the passenger side of their truck.  The driver turned on the lights and CL got out to see what hit them.  The only thing he could find was a stick on the ground, estimated at 1\" in diameter and 14\" to 16\" in length.  CL threw the stick back into the woods at about a 45 degree angle from the right rear of the truck.  He got back inside the cab and the driver turned off the lights.  Within minutes there was another strike of something against the truck on the passenger side.  Again, the driver turned on the lights and CL stepped out.  He found the same stick he had thrown away, laying on the ground beside the truck.  Again CL threw the stick back to roughly the same location and returned to the cab.  After a couple of minutes had passed, the three heard something land in the bed of the truck.  CL stepped out to find the same stick now laying in the truck bed.  This time he threw it off to the left rear of the truck into the woods.  Once again, after a short interval the three heard something strike the left (driver's) side of the truck.  Completely unnerved by what was happening, they drove away.During our meeting with the witnesses, we were unable to go up the Sunday Lake road as it had been blocked by ecology blocks.  However, my son and I did a thorough examination of the woods all around the location of the stick throwing.  While there appeared to be evidence of someone or some thing having moved through the brush, there were no discernible tracks or prints.  Also, there were no signs of human activity there. The photo of the possible footprint he mentioned and showed me at the time was inconclusive, as it was just a partial impression in gravel, and had nothing to indicate scale. CL is unable to find the photo on his phone to share with this report.  On June 4th my son and I returned to the area and this time were able to go all the way up Lennox Creek to the Sunday Lake Trailhead.  What we noted is that this is a very steep canyon with near vertical walls of fractured granite and basalt.  It is very close to the Lennox Mine.  While we were there, rock was occasionally rolling down the slope and crashing into the brush above the road and there were rocks on the road that had clearly come from up-slope.  I believe this is a very plausible explanation for the \"rock throwing\" the young men experienced at this location.On our way out we stopped at the \"second\" location and again thoroughly searched the surrounding woods.  There were still no indications of  human activity in the area that might explain the stick throwing.  CL and AJ are very sincere and compelling witnesses and while I believe there is a natural explanation for the rock throwing at the first location, I am unable to offer a natural explanation for the repeated stick throwing.",

When we got to the parking lol there was one other car parked in the lot. After grabbing my photography gear (camera bag/tripod) we began walking down the path towards the lake. I was looking off to my right hand side and clearly saw something that was all black and bipedal walking parallel with me about 15 yards away. It ducked behind a small tufa as I was watching it walk. I told my dad that I saw something walking on 2 feet and he said that he saw something moving over in that direction as well.",
