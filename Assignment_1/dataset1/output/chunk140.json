            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke at good length with the witness who is in his 50's now. He still lives in the area of the event. I will share his description of the cave and nest. The nest was created by weaving a discarded sleeping bag into some tree branches and twigs, and some larger pieces of trash which included paper and plastic bags, a few scraps of clothing or cloth, and finally some long grasses (hay maybe) and leaves. The nest was oval shaped with a clear depression in the middle where \"someone\" was obviously sleeping. As stated it was at least 6 feet around. \"Something had gone to a lot of trouble making that nest\".In the cave there was no indication of the use of fire in any way. No animal bones or other signs of eating. There was no signs that it had any human waste in there. He noted there was no animal waste either. The entire time he was in and around the cave he had the \"feeling of being watched\" and \"he was creeped out\". The cave was about 6 feet tall and about 4 feet wide. It was nearly totally level. When you entered, it curved around to the left and was about 25-30 feet deep.When he went out the other end, the \"feeling of being watched and a sense of dread was amplified\" so he decided to go back through the cave and head back to join his stepfather and friend.Time to get back to work anyway. As soon as he stepped out the  other side as was about 25 feet away he \"heard a huff\" and he looked up, as that is where he thought the sound originated from. And there it was.The creature was, as stated, about 30 feet up, standing on the rocks almost directly above the entrance. The rocks were \"gray with a bit of green lichen growing on it\" so the reddish brown hair made the creature really stand out. He saw it from \"mid abdomen on up\" and estimated that the portion he saw was \"about 3.5 feet\" and estimated the height \"to be at least 7 feet tall\" based on the height of the rocks it was behind. He also stated that it had to be \"at least 350 lbs\" but it was just a guess. The only feature that stands out were dark lips. He did repeat that the face had a human/animal hybrid composition and a \"typical shaped head with perhaps a slight conical shape as many others have described\". Here is a bit of clarity he sent to me later after we had spoken: \"I think I noticed the lips because it looked more like the face of an Ewok (Return of the Jedi) than it did either ape or human. Like a big Ewok without the cute factor. It also occurred to me it didn't have the hairless snout of an ape but I could see the mouth\". Entire sighting was \"3 seconds and no more than 5\" and as soon as he realized this was not a \"normal local animal\" he was out of there. \"Screamed like a girl and took off running uphill as fast as he could\". As he mentioned, when he got back he told them what had happened and they did just laugh it off. Also, as he mentioned, they decided they had cleared enough for the day and they would come back another time, and they left after just a few hours work, even though they packed tools and fuel for a full days work.This is where the validation for the event comes in, at least for him. A few years later his grandmother told him that his stepfather admitted that he and his friend DID see the creature and the witness's encounter. Saw the whole thing from the front seat of the truck while eating lunch. They were attracted to the event by his screaming. In his opinion,THAT observation of the event is why they have not been back. The land is still owned by the grandmother. The event is known by most of his family and it is simply not discussed. Sort of like it never happened. Since his stepfather is getting on in age and health, he intends to ask him point blank about the event and what he told the grandmother. Hopefully I will have an update to post later.    Even though these last 2 paragraphs are technically \"second hand information\" reserved for Class B sightings, even if they were removed from this report, it is still a very valid Class A sighting with most of the necessary observations needed for a Class A. This admission by the stepdad explains the silence from most of the family. Very good credible witness. He was very thankful to be able to tell his story without the scoffing and ridicule that he has received from his family. Though it is mostly good-natured kidding, the fact they don't believe him has always frustrated him. He had a good clear view of the creature at a distance of 30 feet and was concise and clear as to what was standing there. This is a really good honest observation of his event.",

            "Observed": "I have hiked the Appalachian Trail Georgia to Hanover NH ( 2006-Present ), I am a section hiker. While staying at The Tom Leonard Selter,East Mtn State Park Mass.I  had an incident. While solo camping at the shelter I decided to call a big foot in. Or try, it was a erie evening, i went to get water it was a long way down. While I had a feeling something was watching me. It was getting dark...uneventfully I hiked back. I made a big fire that lasted for three hours, made alot of noise. Did a couple Bigfoot calls. A whoop whoop type. A wood knock ( no return ). A local plane saw my smoke and buzzed right over my camp site. After a great meal, some singing, i went to bed on the TOP bunk. I always sleep with one eye and ear open. At 2:30am I heard a solid Wood Knock followed immediatley by a tree gettintg pushed over. It did not crash . It sounded dead and not tall... \" Wood Knock then a Thud \", after that nothing. 1/2 hour later I was back to sleep.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke at length with the above witness. He stated while section hiking the AT in September 2015.  he arrived at the Tom Lenard Shelter. This shelter is named for a longtime volunteer and hiker of the AT. He set up his camp and went to get water. While hiking to the water source he felt a presence following him. Once he returned to the camp he, lit a large fire and made a few vocal calls, ones similar to suspected Sasquatch. At one point he was overflown by a small plane, (probably saw his fire.)He went to sleep in the shelters loft. Around 2:30am he was awoken to a loud powerful tree knock. Followed by what he described as a large thump. He listened attentively for a bit longer then fell asleep.  He did not look for any tree damage in the morning. The witness states he follows documentary shows and non scripted television regarding Sasquatch. He further stated he had possible encounters in Woodville NY and Hanover NH. He often hikes the AT and will keep reporting any possible activity.The Appalachian Trail, AKA  \"The AT\" runs from Georgia to Maine. There are numerous reports all up and down the country of possible Sasquatch activity along the AT. In Massachusetts, AKA Squatchachusetts, the AT runs North to South through Western Mass in the Berkshires. There are multiple reports in the Berkshires along the AT. Beartown State Forest and October Mountain State Forest to name a few..Oh I will keep in contact with the witness and update the report and more information comes in. Myself and other BFRO investigators are actively working several other cases in this immediate area.",
