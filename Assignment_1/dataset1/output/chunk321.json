            "Observed": "About two years ago I was riding my bicycle with a friend of mine out in a rural area. Just out side of Calhoun, and just barely over the county line in to Walker County. I heard what sounded like heavy wood knocks. Big loud ones. At the time I just thought maybe someone was building something off in the woods. But now I\u0092m more inclined to believe that it could have been a Sasquatch. Because there was nothing but woods, and fields in the section of the road where I heard the noises come from. I haven\u0092t rode out there in a long while either so nothing further to report. My friend that I was riding with would have no recall of the incident. Like I said just sounded like building going on.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on 8 January 2005 by phone. He related that he was cycling with a second individual. They were on a stretch of road that was completely wooded for 300-400 yards with no homes in the immediate vicinity.The sounds of wood hitting together was loud enough to cause an echo and to get the witness attention while riding.The second individual either did not hear or did not pay attention to the sounds and the witness did not ask him if he heard anything.This area is in the John's Mountain WMA and inside the Chattahoochee National Forrest. It is about 30 miles southeast of the Crockford-Pigeon WMA and Pigeon Mountain which has a long history of sightings and strange occurances.",
