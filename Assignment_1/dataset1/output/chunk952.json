            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness is a boy, 12 years old.  I spoke with his grandfather and mother, obtaining permission to interview him. The witness was very mature in his manner of speaking.  Actually, he was more clear and to the point with answering questions than many adults. At the first interview, he was not able to help me pinpoint the location, but shortly thereafter, he e-mailed me a picture from Google Earth with the location shown.  His effort to follow-up was unexpected of a 12 year-old.This young man was walking down a dirt road and when he came around a right hand turn in the road, he noticed the creature about 150 ft away.  He said that the creature looked at him for about 10 seconds.  He said, \u0093Hello?\u0094 and the creature made a vocalization back at him.  His description and mimic of the vocalization was very similar to the deep sounding \u0093blaaat\u0094 call that the night watchmen near Morton, WA heard, see report #22475.  He then heard a squeaky grunt back in the forest.  The creature then turned and retreated back into the trees.  He heard branches breaking and then ran back to his mother.The creature was reported to be gray-brown, about 7 \u00bd ft tall. There was hair around the face. He was not close enough to see details of its face.  The head was very large, and egg shaped.  The pointy end of the \u0093egg\u0094 was up.  He saw that the creature had hands.  He said that he saw the creature\u0092s chest, arms and head, but could not determine gender.There are other reports from the general area of this report, see report #23300.This area, the sequence of events, the description of the creature's appearance and behavior, the vocalizations, and other information not included in the witness' written report, all lead me to conclude that this lucky young man had a eyewitness encounter with a sasquatch.

            "Observed": "First off I was a young boy when this happened so please forgive some memory errors. I was riding my bike in the woods and going home on a trail, I could \"feel\" something watching or \"following\" me. I raced out of the woods to a better trail I could hear in the bush as something was keeping pace with me. The bush was being thrashed about as if it were chasing me or just following me. I cleared the woods and turned to look and I could see something that had reddish-brown hair all over it. It stood very tall well over 8 feet. It had \"blackened skin\" along the facial areas that I could see. This incident has haunted my childhood and adulthood dreams. The area in which I had seen this \"creature\" is now cleared and a subdivision is built upon it. Most of it is still very wooded. As a young boy I hunted these woods often and would smell a horrid stench and often attributed it to a decaying animal, but after the chase I quickly remembered the smell as it filled the air. I was now looking at as this thing stood there. I remember my father telling my about bigfoot and that he and some friends had seen something he could not identify as a boy in West Virginia.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "East Texas is not short on stories about the \u0093swamp man,\u0094 \u0093wild man,\u0094 \u0093swamp ape,\u0094 \u0093wooley booger,\u0094 or bigfoot. Anecdotes about inhuman screams in the night or strange encounters with large, upright, hairy ape-like creatures are very much a part of the culture here. That being said, many who have heard the stories would simply dismiss them as rural legend. When I spoke to the witness who submitted this report, he was very quick to point out that what he encountered was certainly no fictional, rural legend. Up until that summer day of August 1983, the witness had not given much thought to tales of a \u0093swamp man\u0094 that was said to roam the local woods and river bottoms. However, for the better part of six months following his encounter, the witness refused to set foot in the woods. Even now, he is still bothered by what he saw. As the witness (now 32 years old) rode his bicycle on a trail through the woods, he could hear the sounds of something just inside the trees as it seemingly shadowed him. When the witness finally turned to look over his shoulder as he attempted to quickly flee the area, he saw what he described as a \u0093reddish-brown or rusty beast.\u0094 The witness said he can still recall the face of the animal having very little or no hair, and its facial skin was dark or black. The witness said the creature was huge and when he saw it, it was standing there just outside the trees watching him ride away on his bicycle. The witness did not hear any type of vocalization from the animal. The hair of the animal appeared \u0093shaggy.\u0094 Overall, the witness thought that his encounter lasted perhaps one half minute.For a long time afterward, the witness told no one of his encounter for fear of ridicule. Finally, several years later, the witness told his father, at which time his father admonished him for not having spoken up sooner about the incident. Apparently, the witness\u0092s father had some sort of strange encounter years before in West Virginia.  ",
