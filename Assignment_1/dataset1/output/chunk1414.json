            "Follow-Up Report": "Holden Village is an isolated retreat located on a hillside just up from the valley floor.  Its average elevation is around 3300 feet and was formerly the largest copper mine in the U.S.  When the young witness ran behind the maintenance shed, she wasn\u0092t sure if the subject was crouched down or squatting by the garbage cans, or of which way it was initially facing.  It may have disturbed the gravel as it pivoted around toward her.  There were two or three chained garbage cans lined up along the wall of the shed.  Firewood is also normally stacked along that wall.  As she went behind the building, the subject was to her right.When her eyes quickly adjusted, she could see what scuffed the gravel, and observed the subject smoothly rise.  She noticed that it had long gangly arms with hair hanging from them.  She could also see its legs, body, and head, all of which made it look more like a man than a bear, and that it had no ears.  It wasn\u0092t stocky, but as it continued to rise, she could see that it was very tall.  To keep from hitting its head, it made a smooth serpentine dance like move to get its head out from underneath the eves. To lessen the traumatic experience, her dad reassured her that it was just a bear.  (He grinned and chuckled as he told her that.)  The retreat staff also said it was a bear, even though they hadn\u0092t seen it, but after considering her description, they began to think it might have been a \u0093weirdo\u0094 out watching the kids.Growing up, the witness had nightmares of running into a bear that size again.  When she saw black bears, she would comment on how small they were, but was told they were a normal size.  She had the same reaction and response when she saw grizzly bears in Alaska.  They were small in comparison to the \u0093bear\u0094 she saw behind the shed. ",
