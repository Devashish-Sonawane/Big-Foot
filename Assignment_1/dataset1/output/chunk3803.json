            "Observed": "I grew up camping in the Central portion of the Adirondack Mountains.  Indian/Lewey Lake area to be exact.  With that said I have been going there for 25+ years and am very familiar with all of the sights and sounds.  My incident happened a few years ago in the spring of 1999.  I was camping the last weekend of May with one of my dogs on the south side of Lewey lake.  I think there were maybe a total of 5 camps being used.  One of the nights around 10pm I heard a loud and very unfamiliar cry/scream come from the north side of the lake.  I sat there in silence with my dog, almost in shock because I had never heard anything like this before.  It went on with a series of screams for about 10 seconds.  It was not a bear, not a moose, etc.  It made me a bit uneasy as I could not place the sound.  It was not from any campers either as there were only a handful and were all on the same side of the lake as myself.  I just went to this website today and listened to some of the sound clips available of 'BigFoot'.  The sound I heard almost exactly matches these clips.",

No one camps on the other side of the lake.--The sounds came from directly across the lake from the witness, approximately \u00bd mile away.--Whatever made the sound was large.--Each scream lasted for 10 seconds and the whole episode lasted for 5 minutes.--The witness is familiar with the outdoors and all the local wildlife, and this did not match other animals he has heard.--The screams were most similar to the Klamath scream on the website.",

There wasn't much traffic on the road, but when she crossed a overpass. She saw something stooped over in the road, as she got closer it stood up . It looked at her just for a couple of seconds then walked away. It just stepped over the guardrail, and was gone. And only one week later on channel 10 news someone else seen it also. They even had a drawing of it on TV. My mom said it was the same thing she saw. This is the first  time ever she has ever saw anything strange like that. It really makes us all wonder.",
