            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.The witness camps at this location about five times yearly for the past six years. The Wind River Work Center is a USDA Forest Service location. They walked down to the creek and started to set up camp. The aggression sounds the witness refers to at 9:15pm were mimicked by him and it sounded as a mix of whoop and scream \"with a lot of air to them\". There were two within ten seconds and then a third about ninety seconds later. The bushes moved and fifteen feet away he saw the silhouette of a figure at least eight feet tall turn to the side. He saw the left arm as it turned. It had a large round head and wide torso. They ran back to the truck.About ten to fifteen minutes later the witness got out of the truck and sounded a hand held air horn. They set up camp and went inside their tents. At 11:00pm he heard a deep whistle. He heard rocks crunching as something was walking by the creek. Pebbles were thrown at their tents and there was an odor the witness describes as \"stinky feet.\" At 12:39am he heard a branch break about sixty feet away. Their Pekingese dog was growling until 1:00am, then everything was quiet. A chair was found on the ground the next morning. No tracks were found due to the rocky ground. The witness said he will not go there again. All the campers were very upset. The witness did want to file a report and talk to a BFRO investigator. The others did not want to talk.Note: due to low light conditions and lack of detail seen, this is a Class B report. If more detail would have been seen, it could be a Class A. ",

            "Observed": "Last Sunday (November 16, 2003) My friend, my dog and I traveled from Portland, OR to Northern California for some late season backpacking. We stopped at the Aikens Creek campground (West of Orleans, CA and just west of Bluff Creek on HWY 96) at approximately 6:00pm, as it was too late to hike in anywhere that evening and the Six Rivers NF website listed it as one of the campgrounds open through November. As we neared the pay station a sign deferred us to render payment directly to the campground host, and as we approached the host's site it became clear that the site was vacant with just a few small items left behind. So, we took the liberty to drive in and explore the portion of the campground that was open. Driving near the Southern edge (nearest to the Klamath river) we smelled a pervasive \"skunky\" odor, but thought nothing of it at the time.",
