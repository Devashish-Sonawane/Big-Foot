            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the teenage witness at length about the sighting. The witness is 15 years old.   His friend is also 15.  The witness sounded mature for his age and answered all questions directly and in a matter of fact fashion.He and a friend were participating in the Michigan Youth Deer Hunt and were getting ready to head back home as it was getting dark, when they saw the animal step out from a wooded area into a cornfield. The witness looked through a 4x rifle scope and shared it with his friend,   They did not get a look at any facial detail because of the low light level.  The bigfoot saw them and stopped in mid-stride, quickly returning to the wooded area it came from and out of sight.  The animal was between 50 and 75 yards away.   He stated the hair color was grey/silver and reminded him of the silver color of a male silverback gorilla.   He said it was strange because there was a good layer of dried leaves on the ground, but the bigfoot made no sound as it walked, even though other animals were easily heard. Earlier in the summer, the witness was riding his horse in the same location and the horse refused to cross the same field.  He dismounted the horse and tried to lead her through the field on a trail, but the horse refused to cross the cornfield, which was unusual for the horse as he had trained it and could get her to do anything except cross deep water.I am somewhat familiar with the area. The area is thick woods and large fields, some of which are corn, and some of which are food plots planted for the local elk population. There is a variety of wildlife in the area including frequent reports of mountain lion. I have dirt biked and mushroom hunted and went elk watching in the area.",
