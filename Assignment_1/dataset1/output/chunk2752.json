            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness, Freddie, over the phone and have added the following to the original report. Freddie is an experienced dozer and heavy equipment operator in the coal industry and lives in Alabama. He has been to Colorado twice in the past few years to hunt elk and deer during rifle season, and he stated he is a life-long experienced hunter.  On November 4th of 2009 he was in Colorado hunting with some friends on private property near the Sanchez Reservoir in south central Colorado. It had been snowing most of that day and about six inches of snow had accumulated on the ground. While glassing the surrounding area with binoculars in the late afternoon hours, approximately one half hour before sunset, and while looking for elk, Freddie noticed a tall figure walking along a ridge line below him and to his southeast. It was approximately 300-400 yards from his location. He thought it was an elk at first and then realized it was walking on two legs like a man. To him the figure looked large and tall, and was covered in light brown, long, flowing hair. He watched as it moved along the ridge line, all the while facing away from his direction and acting as if it was looking for something towards a clearing to its east. It never left the tree line. He stated that he thinks the distance it covered while it approached and left was between 50-60 yards each way and it covered it quickly. It then turned back walking in the direction it approached and quickly disappeared back into the trees. He then thought, \"What kind of idiot would be out walking in this area without hunters orange on and to possibly get shot?\" Freddie stated that despite his thoughts, he knew that it was not a man. Freddie did not want to trespass on the surrounding private property to get a closer look, instead he chose to go back to his group.  ",
