            "Follow-Up Report": "I had a nice phone conversation with the witness. This area is quite close to me actually. I am quite familiar with the area. Mixed rural Kansas farmland with fairly flat landscapes. Lots of creeks, rivers and some marshlands. She was about 17-18 in 1994 when the sighting happened. She was driving home as stated about 11-11:15pm south on Hwy 169 from Paola towards Osowatomie KS. The old sanitation plant was more towards Osowatomie and the highway is 2 lanes each direction. The exact intersection was Cedar Niles Rd & 169 Highway. As she was going south, it ran across the road from east to west. It was already moving when she saw it, and she had slowed down just a bit because of a slight curve in the road. It was walking in a hurried fashion but not running. It never looked her way. It just \u0093walked over the fence in stride, never missing a beat.\u0094 The fences around here, barbed wire, are a pretty much standard 4 ft. in height. The creature was nearly twice that height, so 7.5 to 8 ft. She did not recall any specific physical traits other than it was \u0093very tall, very fast and walking in a nearly total upright position.\u0094 It was not bent or hunched over. It all happened within a 3-5 second span.She grew up on a farm and is familiar with the usual and customary wildlife. She knew what \u0093it wasn\u0092t, a bear or anything else in the Kansas family tree of animals\u0094. She decided to report it after her fear of potential ridicule subsided and she wanted to tell her story. She is a good solid witness and is now quite intrigued as to the makeup of these creatures. I assured her that there is a lot more activity in Kansas than one would imagine and she will be paying a bit more attention during her hikes in the woods.----------------------------------------------------------------------Supplemental note from Matt Moneymaker:Why would a bigfoot be in this area at this time?  This question can be asked of so many sightings, especially in the midwest in areas where there's no large tracts of forest or swamps around.  The answer is deer -- the staple protein sources of bigfoots. There are lots of deer in Kansas. Deer cross highways. Predators will follow them. ",
