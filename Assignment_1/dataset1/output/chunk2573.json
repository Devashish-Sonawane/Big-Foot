On many occasions I had heard something large moving nearby and always felt like I was being watched. I always thought it was due to the location that I was in, but after my sighting, I could not go there again with or without someone else.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness by phone.  She was very pleasant and grateful that we were contacting her regarding her report.  Even at the young age of 11, she had spent quite a bit of time in and around the woods.  She was also quite adept at handling a firearm, having won awards in shooting competitions.  She was very familiar with the local animals including coyotes, foxes, raccoons, deer, etc.  She was fishing at a small pond during the month of August.  As it started to become dark, she packed up her gear and headed to the house.  There is a barbed wire fence separating the pond area from the house.  As she negotiated the fence, she looked up and saw a creature about 75 yards in front of her.  It was standing in an open area just outside of a wood line.   The creature vocalized at her and was waving its arms above its head.  The house was between the pond and the creature so she had to run in the direction of the animal to get to the house.  She ran in and locked all the doors.  She was so afraid that she slept on the floor against the wall that night.She described the animal as \u0093definitely not a person\u0094.  She said it looked like one-half monkey and one-half human but seemed more human than animal.  The hair was blackish-brown with scattered gray on the chest and face.  The hair was thinning in places and after some discussion she said that it looked like an animal showing signs of age.  It was tall.  She estimated it about 7 feet tall, but stated that it was a long time ago and she was pretty scared.  She could see some muscle definition but described the creature more like a basketball played instead of a large football player. Although she was very frightened, looking back on it she does not feel that the creature meant to harm her.  Instead, she feels like it was trying to get her attention and letting her know it was there.  After some discussion, she felt a little sad that the sasquatch could have been alerting her as it might have needed some assistance of some sort. The witness, her older brother, and an older cousin would often walk in and around the woods near the property. There were several instances, especially around a nearby cemetery, where they all felt as if they were being watched and followed.  They could hear definite heavy bi-pedal footfalls and whatever was following them would stop moving when they stopped to listen.  She described the feeling as very creepy.  She had never equated the sounds with being a possible sasquatch until she had her sighting.    ",

The South San Juan Wilderness (in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado) is considered to be Colorado\u0092s wildest corner.  It was in the backcountry of this wilderness in the fall of either 1977 or 1979 (I forget which) that a sow Grizzly Bear was startled and attacked a bow hunter.  He was mauled but managed to kill the bear with an arrow he repeatedly drove into the bear\u0092s chest.  It was thought that the Grizzly had long been extirpated from all of Colorado.  If there are Grizzlies still in Colorado, this is where they are thought to be.",
