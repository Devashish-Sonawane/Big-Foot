            "Observed": "After reading your reports from Florida's Lake County I must put down something that happend to me as a child. We had been staying near Lady Lake close to the Griffin Chain of Lakes. We were staying with my grandparents in early 80 or 81. It was late in the evening and everyone was in bed. I had a room on the front of the house by myself. I hear a noise outside my window and we too scared to look. I was about 10 or 11. There were many different sounds, from growling and snorting to footsteps. Again I didn't look and stayed in bed awake for a couple of hours. The noises only last about 5-10 minutes. I went outside as soon as I woke up in the morning and found an intersting item. My brother and I had piled up sand in the dirt driveway the day before. This morning there were 2 large footprints in the sand pile.  I showed the tracks to my family and they all played it off as a fluke or a neighborhood kid goofing off. I can't think of too many kids with feet that big. I measured them with a tape and they were about 17\" long and 8-10\" acrossed.",

Every year his family came to vacation in Florida at his grandparents.  The growling and snorting he heard that night was loud enough for him to hear with windows closed in a concrete block home. His impression was that it was right outside the room. The sand pile was about 2 feet across and 1 foot high.  The footprints were close together as if something had jumped onto the sand pile with both feet.  They resembled human bare footprints and were about 2 1/2 inches deep. His family made fun of him as he compared them to his grandfather's shoes.  He remembers his grandfather talking about skunk-ape sightings in the newspaper.  There are numerous reports from this area of Florida, close to the Ocala National Forest.",

The road is sandy and white, and as we were moving along we noticed a figure up in the distance, silhouetted against the white sandy road that was going up hill.  We were a good distance away, and we initially thought it must be a man, but there was no campground in that area, and besides in July, it is extremely hot out there.  The figure did not appear to be carrying anything, like a hiker would.  There is a trail about a mile or two from this area, but the trail crosses the road a good bit south of where we were.  Anyway as we got closer the figure just seemed to be all dark colored with hair.  It was on the side of the road and as we approached it crossed the road to the other side.  It did not appear to be as big as I would have imagined, but was probably about 5 to 6 ft tall.  When our car got to the point where we had seen it cross into the woods, we stopped and looked, it was just thick piney woods, and we were both really kind of in shock about all of this.  It was a few hours later I realized we should have looked for tracks.",
