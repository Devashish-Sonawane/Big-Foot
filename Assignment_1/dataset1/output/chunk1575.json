The weather was cool and clear. As they came around a curve the animal was squatting along the road going through some garbage that someone had dumped. He quickly stopped the jeep.  They were able to observe the animal for about thirty seconds in the high beam of the headlights. The animal took two or three steps backwards into the center of the road, turned and looked at them. Then it squatted down and leaped twenty to thirty feet off the road and was gone down into the ravine.  He described the animal as being about eight feet tall, upper torso being slender and weighing about 300 pounds.  Because the hair was so tight he could see the definition of the muscles as it squatted. The calf muscles were especially huge. The black hair was very short on the lower body with somewhat longer and thinner hair on the chest and shoulders. The head was round with a short neck.  He was unable to see any facial features.I also spoke with his brother-in-law.  He stated that the next year he had seen what he thought was probably the same animal briefly about a mile further up the road.   ",
