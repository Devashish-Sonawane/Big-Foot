He added the following:Incident #1, 1978; The creature that both he and his mother saw had \"caramel color\" hair and was upright, walking on 2 legs. They saw it at a distance of 50' and watched as it approached a roadside embankment, and effortlessly jumped almost vertically, up the incline. It was between 6 and 7 ' tall. Larry was 8 years old at the time.Incident #2, 1986; Larry, now 16 years old, was parked in his car, in a church parking lot, near his home, at dusk, playing with the radio. Clumps of dirt/rocks were thrown at his vehicle first hitting the hood, then the back of the car. The creature was observed near a berm, wood side to the road, as he slowly drove towards his home. He described a terrible smell, light brown hair, 7' tall, flat face, and human teeth, which he observed through the car window, only 3-5' away. Larry offered to take me to both of the sites he had experiences at.Today he has 12 acres in a holler near Oneida, TN. His trailer has been hit by pebbles, small stones, in the overnight hours. Howls and grunts have been heard, as well as wood knocks, on his property. He has heard reports of Bigfoot sightings in the nearby area from others.",
