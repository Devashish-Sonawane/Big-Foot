            "Follow-Up Report": "Contacted witness by phone.  He described the sighting in detail for me and his description matched his original statement.  He went into greater detail about the size and posture of the animal he witnessed.  Witnessed animal walking down right side of the road.  He thought it was a person at first then noticed the long hair all over its body as it was crossing the road.  The animal then stopped with its back to the vehicle.  The hair was eight to twelve inches long and \"swayed\"  as the animal turned and stopped.  The distance to the animal at this point was between ten and twelve feet away.  The animal looked as if it was bent over while walking.  Arms hung straight down and were very long, past knees.  The hands were visible and balled into fists.  The legs were long, thin and \"gangly\".  Shoulders were very wide like a football player's with pads on.  Very large, at least eight feet tall.  He estimated the animal's weight at between 600 and 700 lbs.  The animal looked as if it ducked its head and neck as it stood there.  Never looked at the vehicle directly.  Stood still a few seconds and then went down to the left into a ditch toward a fence.  Never saw it after it went into the ditch.  The color was uniform and dark brown or \"coconut\".  The hair was much shorter on the head.  Could not see the feet and no odor was noticed, windows were up on the vehicle.  The animal walked at a normal gate, not in a hurry.  The witness went back a few days later to look for hair in the fence or tracks but found nothing.This witness was very open about the encounter and I could tell it struck him at his core.  He is still questioning what he saw and has not quite come to grips with it.  He contacted us only after the urging of his family members.  He is afraid of being ridiculed because of the sighting. ",

He struck me as a very credible witness with considerable time spent in the woods hunting, camping and has worked as a fly fishing guide.  He made an interesting point about his time spent in the woods, he has always listened to the variety of animal sounds and tried to place what he heard with a known animal.  This was the first time he was stumped and concerned about what he heard.  The only similar recorded sound he could find was the knocks and whoops sound bite on the website.In his line of work as a police officer he has heard of other reports of possible bigfoot activity around the Arizona high country.The reference to Heber AZ was just as a land mark for the general area and not a specific location for any reports or stories.",
