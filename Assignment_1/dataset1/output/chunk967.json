            "Observed": "I work in the oil field ind. hauling salt water, and at one site, we have something big walking around. I have seen it for myself, as have a few others. But on the night of Aug. 26 2011, I seen its eyes on the other side of the fence that is at least 9-10 feet high. After I seen the eyes, it moved out of view, then started to throw rocks at the tank. The first thing that caught my attention was the lack of wild life sounds and the smell of a skunk, and the sound of something that sounded like a low growl. Another person had put a game camera up, and it got a picture of something blocking the camera 30 min before I had got there. I have seen other things in my time as a truck driver, but this is a little to close to home.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone. He added the following details. The creature was described as having a large person silhouette with broad shoulders and glowing red eyes. He estimates that the eyes were about 7-8 feet off the ground and were easily seen through the widely spaced cable of the fence. At the time of his sighting, the normally loud compressors at the site were in an off cycle, and the environment was dead quiet. The rocks it threw at the tank were about tennis ball sized and most likely came from the riverbed area. The witness believes 5 rocks were thrown with 2 hitting the most westerly tank in a group of 6 storage tanks. This tank is the closest one to the creature's location when first sighted. Even though the rocks did not land near him and his truck, the witness felt intimidated and departed the site. He didn't look at the rocks until his return the following night. I saw the game cam photo. It shows a 9/10 solid black exposure with no detail. It was the timing of the photo that intrigued the witness, not the content.At about 1:30 AM, about 3 weeks after his initial report, the witness and a co-worker were exploring the river bottom less than 100 yards from his sighting. A deer came crashing through the brush on the far side of the creek and froze when it saw the two men. Within seconds, a huge rock (described by the witness as a boulder) flew into the center of the riverbed. He felt that it was not aimed to hit them, but to intimidate them. Both men and deer quickly departed. The witness also mentioned that one of his coworkers was visibly shaken by something that happened at the site but would not share his experience. The next thing he heard was that his coworker had quit and moved to another state. The witness has been a truck driver for 7 years and lives in a rural home a short distance from the sighting. Previously, his wife told him that she had seen red eyes at night looking at their house. This is the second independent report from the same gas well site. I found him to be a credible witness, and his observations were consistent with the witness from the other report. (See Report #30238, Worker has late night encounter at gas well near Aledo.)",
