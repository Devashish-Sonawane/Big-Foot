            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with LD by phone on the evening of 26, Jan. 2006 about his brief sighting that he had while returning from Shingletown towards Redding, CA.  LD has a very vivid memory of that sighting. He is a credible witness. Other details gathered from the phone conversation:They were about eight minutes out of town. It was about 3500 foot elevation on highway 44.  He said there were, \u0093many pine trees on both sides of that road. He said many of the trees were at least four feet in diameter at their base.  He first saw the figure about 300 ft. ahead of him, barely illuminated by his truck headlights.It was walking across the road from south to north, and I could only see it from the left side.\u0093When I got within about two hundred feet of it my first thoughts were that I couldn\u0092t believe what I was seeing.I knew what it was, and that it had to be abBigfoot. This creature was on two legs walking like a power walker would walk, with a very long stride and with its arms making a very large arc as a power walker would be doing trying to make its body move faster.\" \"The hair color looked very dark and was probably black.  While this creature was in the middle of the road it made a real quick turn to look toward my truck headlights.\" \"It looked just like the one in the Patterson film, meaning the one that the two cowboys filmed when they were on horse back in a river bed.\u0094  \u0093It seemed surprised but not scared of the truck and its headlights. It looked at my truck like it was making sure that it was going to make it safely across the road. \"It had the biggest, thickest, chest, shoulders and arms than you could imagine. It looked larger than three people put together.\" \u0093I wasn\u0092t too scared of what I had seen, but I wasn\u0092t going to stop, and or get out of my truck to check out the area where it had crossed the road.  I was way too busy watching and thinking to myself, am I really seeing what I am seeing? Then it was gone before I could ask my wife about what had just taken place. I never seen any facial features, or smelled anything strange. If I were in the woods hunting, and seen one of these things, I could not shoot at it because of those human characteristics. There is no comparing this creature with a gorilla, because they are totally different in walk and mannerisms.\u0094 ",
