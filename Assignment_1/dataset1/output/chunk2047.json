            "Observed": "At precisely 1:30 am, on the 25 of August 2009. I was driving a 18 wheeler on CR.196 which runs off of FM.416 in Freestone county Texas. I had just driven about 100 meters on a oil field lease road, when I spotted what I thought was a large Russian boar hog on the right side of the lease road about 75-100 feet in front of me. What really caught my eye was that it had a really big head covered with long bushy hair. I'd been driving about 20 mph before I saw it, but as soon as I saw it, I slowed down to maybe 5 mph. At this time, it stood up on it's hind legs and looked directly at me and growled at me as if it were a wolfman like in the old 50's movies.Then it ran on its hind legs like a human being, but faster than anything I've ever seen in my life; across the road in front of me, and into a tree line. I was in a 18 wheel Mack truck and this thing stood so tall as to look at me eye to eye.I've worked in the oil field for years and I've seen hogs of all sizes and breeds.Thousands of deer, and even black panthers.But this was something different, almost un-natural.  I've never been more afraid in my life,than during the time I saw it and while I was performing the job I sent to do.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness initially on August 29, 2009, and have worked with him at length to create the witness sketches shown below. The following details can be added: \u0095 The creature stood approximately 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall, with 12\u0094 long, grayish-black, messy hair on its head, and 3 or 4 inch hair on the rest of its body. The witness estimates its weight at a lanky 300 plus pounds, with thick thighs. He said the face was so black that he could not make out any facial details.\u0095 The creature was originally squatting down facing his direction, doing something on the ground with its hands. He believes it was eating something and his arrival interrupted it. He estimates he was at a distance of 50 feet away from it when it stood and growled at him. He had his driver\u0092s side window half down, and heard it clearly over the diesel engine.\u0095 The creature moved rapidly from right to left, \u0093faster than a deer\u0094. It arms were very long, and it pumped them like a sprinter as it was running. It ducked down just as it was entering the tree line, covering over 50 feet in only 2 or 3 seconds.\u0095 He reported that he was terribly shaken up and afraid. He was on the property for at least an hour doing his job and was constantly looking and listening for its return. He reported the sighting immediately to his supervisor. Following the incident, he did not sleep well, and was sick in his stomach for days.    \u0095 This sighting occurred within two miles of the Richland Chambers Lake and Richland Creek Wildlife Management Area. The lake is a 44,752-acre reservoir impounding waters of Chambers and Richland Creeks for Tarrant County (Fort Worth) water supply and outdoor recreation, boasting 330 miles of shoreline. Richland Chambers Lake is reported to be the state's third largest inland lake and the largest sailing basin in Texas.Richland Creek Wildlife Management Area is owned and managed by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. It is located in an ecotone separating the Post Oak Savannah and Blackland Prairie ecological regions and the area lies almost entirely within the Trinity River flood plane. The average annual rainfall is 40 inches. Its wetlands are just a small part of the Richland Creek Wildlife Management Area. The area has a vast bottomland hardwood forest characterized by cedar, green ash, elm, box elder, black willow, and pockets of various types of oaks and native pecan. There is another 2,000 acres of timber and 9,000 acres of bottom land in Freestone County.  UPDATE: 10-22-09. The witness reported this incident to his superiors, and it was reported to the Energy company. Since his sighting, this job site is no longer worked at night; only in the daytime.",
