This conclusion came from three men who have spent a number of years chasing the elusive Northwest Bigfoot - a creature or legend, said to be about eight feet tall and rather between a man and ape in appearance. Dennis Gate and Chuck Martin, of Mount Vernon, and Lynn McKenney of the Bigfoot Information Center at The Dalles, Ore., spent Tuesday night sleeping near the river where the footprints were discovered Sunday by two area residents.",

            "Media Issue": "According to Bob Everett, head of the Northern California Bigfoot Organization, the latest sighting occurred on May 18 when a man spotted a huge hairy creature crossing a dirt road between Hayfork and Hyampon, two small towns on Hayfork Creek in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Everett says this was the third Bigfoot report in recent days. All occurred within ten miles of each other, he said. \"This is the time of year they (Bigfoot) start to move,\" he told the Record Searchlight. Everett, who describes himself as a decorated veteran of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, tries to visit the location of each sighting to see if there is any physical evidence, including tracks. In the first two instances, there was none. He had not yet visited the third site as of May 20. ",
