            "Observed": "I was doing seismic, drilling in the Angelina National forest for several weeks.  Late one afternoon, in a opening, we decided to stop and take a break, on the upper end of an open area in the thick woods. It was quiet, when I saw something, large and dark brownish, stand up and walk away from me. It was approx; 100 yards away. It walked 20 to 50 feet then descended into a ravine, it looked to go down on all four legs as it went into the ravine then it was gone. I thought it was a bear, but chances of seeing a bear in 1979, would be slim.This animal walked on two legs. This only lasted for just a few seconds,10 maybe. I turned to my coworker and asked, \"Did you see that? he said yes, and what the bleep was that?\" I have thought about this for several years and in my mind's eye I can still see the animal walking away from me to this day, 30 years later.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "\u0095 The two men had been drilling seismic holes at one eighth of a mile intervals in a straight line. They had turned off the equipment and were sitting on their machines taking a break. \u0095 The witness noticed that the woods had become unnaturally quiet. His description was this: \u0093It became so quiet you could hear your cigarette burning.\u0094 \u0095 Movement caught his eye as the creature stood up. He briefly saw its profile before it turned and moved silently off in a relaxed pace from left to right. It took four or five steps and was gone into the ravine. He was immediately struck by the way its long arms swung. In that instant he realized it was not a bear he was observing.\u0095 This can be added to its description: The body was stocky and quite muscular. It was broad shouldered with a very large chest. It did not taper at the waist but remained thick and solid with an estimated weigh of 400lbs. It was solidly covered with four or five inch, long reddish brown hair with the exception of the facial area where the hair was sparse. Its height was 6 feet or taller.\u0095 The witness had the impression that it had been watching them and was curious about the noisy machine they were running. At no time did he feel threatened or scared. \u0095 The 153,179-acre Angelina National Forest is located in Angelina, Nacogdoches, San Augustine and Jasper counties. The forest lies in the Neches River Basin and on the north and south shores of Sam Rayburn Reservoir, an 114,500-acre lake.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I was able to contact the son who matched all details of his father\u0092s description of the experience while adding the following:He was in the passenger seat and saw the creature when it first crossed the road from right to left in front of the truck and then viewed it through the truck's back window. To him its color, size and build was similar to a very large Rottweiler dog, but there was no tail or snout. Instead of running like a dog, it had more of a loping motion like when a jackrabbit casually runs, with it\u0092s rear lower than it\u0092s head. He said that he saw long flattened ears flopping behind the creature\u0092s head as it ran. They saw it for about 15 seconds then it darted off into the woods behind the truck. It really frightened him by the way it was able to keep pace with the speed of the truck and by the fact they couldn\u0092t figure out what it was. He was not able to recall facial features other than to confirm that it did not have a snout.Regarding the long flattened flopping ears, I asked the son if it could have been just long hair growing from the head. He agreed that it could have been long hair, but because it moved so much like a giant jackrabbit he was expecting big ears somewhere.  I know the father witness and encouraged him to file this report after hearing him talk about his experience. He was reluctant to file the report but finally agreed. In a separate interview, the son witness confirmed everything the father reported. Based on my familiarity with the witnesses and the way they answered my questions, its apparent they are remembering a genuine experience.",
