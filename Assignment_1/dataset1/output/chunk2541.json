He often has to trap wild hogs on the property because they tear up and root up everything.  Anyway, he was at the very back of the property checking traps and he saw something run behind a tree.  It was very big, hairy, and running on two feet.  He said the color was charcoal gray and it was about 6 feet tall.  He did not see it again after it hid behind the tree because he left the area immediately.  It really scared him and he says that it reminded him of a huge monkey or ape.  The area that this took place is very secluded with nothing but thick woods all around.",

There are ponds and small lakes on the property.  She was concerned about confidentiality.  She didn't want information about the property location to be published and she was hesitant about publishing her last name, but she said it would be o.k. to publish that it was near Quitman, TX and to publish her first name.They are not the property owners.  Her husband works the land for for an older retired couple._____________________________________This is second-hand information.

One exception is second-hand information coming from an immediate family member, where both the witness and the submitter are adults, and there is a rational concern (such as an employment situation) that explains why the actual witness is hesitant to report the observation directly.
