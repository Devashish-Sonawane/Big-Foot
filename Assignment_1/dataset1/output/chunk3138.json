Barrel would not sit straight so I was walking across the yard to get a piece of pipe to sit under it to hold it up. Half way across the yard I heard brush, breaking when I looked over,we saw a large hairy creature very tall staring at us. I let out a holler  and it turned and walked away slowly in a large stride swinging its arms almost like a person but definitely was not. Looked about seven foot tall.",

The following is what the witness described to me. App. 7:30 PM Pike County, Ohio \"My girlfriend and I went to my grandmothers house to check on some things. We noticed that the barrel we use for burning leaves and trash had tipped over. I thought that was weird because the barrel was quite full. We went around the garage towards the wood to have a look around. That's when we saw this large creature with real long arms. We just looked at it as it moved towards the woods. It took three large steps. Then, we ran for the car. It scared us. All I can remember now is that it was like a shadow. I don't remember any other details, only to say to didn't seem afraid of us.\" \"My dad is 6' 3\"  250 lb. it was considerably larger than him and taller with long arms.\" He went on to tell me that they were about two car lengths from this creature. He apologized for not being able to give a better description.. . ",
