We were all in our late teens but very experienced campers and very comfortable in the woods. On the 2nd night of our trip we made camp in a low area several miles off the trails near where our topographic map showed a Civil War cemetery was located, though we were unable to find the site.",

It was deep within a reservist training area and there were no foot paths leading to the remote location they chose for a camp. While camping, they ate well, and cooked foods over their fire such as chicken. A nearby marshy area was noted to have a large population of box turtles, attesting to the relative availability of resources in the area.Mr. K. returned to the area a year later and located the cemetery his group had original been searching for, but there were no further incidents on their return trip.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Interestingly, I heard of this incident from a third party and therefore had the opportunity to interview both of them cold, before they knew of BFRO, and even before they knew they would be contacted. The witnesses are 15 and 16 years old. I contacted the first witness, and interviewed him, and found him to be quite credible. He was still excited about the 6 month old event. I contacted the second witness immediately thereafter and  interviewed him the same day.  I met him at the site of the incident, and he showed me exactly where everything occurred. The area is a narrow riverine bottomland, on the small flood plain of a creek that could be easily waded by a human. It is wooded with native hardwoods along the creek, and pines on the higher topography on each side.Their report of the location is accurate. As they entered the woods, they heard noise, and both looked up simultaneously to see a very large, black biped run across their path at a distance of 75 feet (measured). The path that the creature covered, as they saw it, was about 60 feet long. Directly behind the creature on its path when it came into view, is a steep, deep stream gully. It seems therefore that the creature was likely not already at a full run when they saw it, but may have been startled by them, and fled. As the creature crossed their path on a run, it turned and looked at them, accelerating, and one-stepped a 5' berm above the creek's flood plain, and disappeared into the woods. Neither witness distinguished facial features, only both saying that it was \"all black\". It had longish black hair covering its body. Neither witness described the hair further. One said the head seemed small for the body, or for the shoulders, and neither noticed visible ears. Both described it as \"BIG\".  Both witnesses described long arms and a long, smooth gait. The witness that took me to the site showed me the approximate height of the creature on a tree, and it was 7.5' to 8' tall.",
