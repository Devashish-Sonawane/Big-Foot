            "Follow-Up Report": "In speaking with the witness, the details of the night fishing experience were relayed, and the exact location was determined.The witness, at about 10:15 PM, heard either movement or rustling coming from an area between the fishing ponds, near Blue Branch Creek.  He had been at this location for over an hour, and is firm in his belief that nobody else was around.  After jokingly \"grunting\" back in response, the witness states a large rock was thrown from the same area, in his direction.  The rock hit the water and made a large splash.  The witness was able to actually see the rock as it impacted the pond.  Startled, the fisherman collected his gear and promptly left the area.  I visited this location during daylight hours approximately two weeks after the report was submitted, and captured this 360\u00b0 image of the ponds and the adjoining Blue Branch Creek (360 image may not display correctly in all browsers)bluebranch - Spherical Image - RICOH THETAThe tree line seen on the far side of the ponds is Blue Branch Creek. The witness is aware of the other sasquatch-related activity that had occurred nearby, in and around the Monkey Mountain Conservation Area.  In fact, the Blue Branch Creek merges into Sni-a-Bar Creek only a few blocks away, within the conservation area.  Monkey Mountain Conservation Area is located just east on RD Mize Road from the intersection with Buckner Tarsney Road.  It consists of 855 acres of trails, forested area and pasture.  Discounting the anecdotal explanation of a derailed circus train losing a few \"monkeys\" to the wild, it's difficult to determine the origination of the park's moniker.  There has been no historical reference found to document any such train derailment.  Monkey Mountain Conservation Area has indeed been the site of previous BFRO reports, and the proximity of this fisherman's experience makes it worth adding to the discussion.  Please reference Report #30573, Report #39835,  Report #41395 for the details of those occurrences.Readers familiar with other reports of possible sasquatch activity already know that rock-throwing is one of the more common occurrences that is experienced.  The meaning behind this action is of course only speculation, but explanations have been suggested.  Is the rock or object thrown to intimidate a person into leaving?  Is it inspired by curiosity, and meant to illicit a particular response?  The effect it generally has is that those who experience it are startled and/or make the decision to leave the area.  In summary, I feel that the witness was observant and confident enough to rule out other people as the culprit(s) of the rock-throwing, and I consider the witness to be credible and consistent with his account of his experiences on that night.",
