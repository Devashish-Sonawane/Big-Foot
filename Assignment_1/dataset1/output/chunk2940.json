            "Observed": "I live in Kimberly Idaho. While my grandson was here visiting we drove to the South Hills in the Sawtooth Forrest.  We turned off on a dirt road called Wolstrom Hollow. I have been there many",
            "YEAR 2": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the reporting witness and learned that she is a former law enforcement deputy. She recounted the disturbing encounter she and her grandson had and said it is something they both think about every day. A few additional details came out in our phone interview. The grandmother is familiar with this particular area and in the past has enjoyed viewing the multitude of birds and small animals that live along the creek. The day of the sighting, the reporting witness, her grandson and her eight month old puppy left Kimberly in the late afternoon for a nature outing. Having not visited this spot for about a year, the grandmother  mistakenly took a wrong turn at the fork as they neared the dam site. Realizing her mistake, she turned her truck around and headed back to take the correct turn. As soon as she made this turn and headed toward the dam, she was overcome with an eerie or uneasy feeling. This area had never given her a negative feeling before. Puzzled, but not wanting to disturb her grandson and ruin the outing, she kept this to herself and continued as far as the road was safe to drive her truck. Wanting to enjoy the fresh air, they had the windows down as they drove. Both noticed that no bird or animal noises could be heard. This quiet was unusual in the grandmother\u0092s prior experience here.They pulled off the road in a pull-out area and the three of them began hiking toward the meadow and dam. Grandmotther noticed lots of elk prints and droppings and some deer sign where they parked and along the trail. She had never seen any sign of elk or deer presence here before.The closer they got to the meadow with the beaver dam, the more uncomfortable grandmother felt. She also began smelling a strong animal odor and thought maybe it was related to all the ungulate droppings in the area. After walking about a quarter mile, they stopped when grandmother thought she heard people talking or mumbling. At about the same time in the direction of the dam, she saw a silver or grey object (perhaps a car?). Putting two and two together, grandmother figured there must be some people up to no good parked in the trees beyond the dam. She kept focused in that direction. Grandson was looking off to the side where he thought he saw something moving in the trees. As they stood still listening and watching, Grandmother asked grandson if he smelled or heard anything. He replied that he kept hearing sticks being banged together or against a rock.Grandmother decided to tell grandson that she wanted to turn around because she felt uncomfortable going further. Before she could say anything, grandson said something scary was staring at him from the cover of the tree line, less than thirty yards away. At the same time, grandmother's usually playful puppy sensed something threatening and let out a loud warning bark. Although frightened, the three of them began walking back to the truck and resisted the urge to run. The dog kept looking back and grandson said he thought the thing he saw was following them. They heard twigs snapping periodically behind them.Once in the truck and headed home, grandmother asked grandson what he saw. He said he saw something that was really tall, hunched over and peering through the trees at him. It looked like a person with a lot of hair all over its body, except that it was much bigger than a man. The most striking feature of the animal was its large eyes that were bright yellow like the sun. It looked right at him and grandson described the eyes as \u0091penetrating\u0092 and \u0091evil.\u0092 He felt menace in the animal\u0092s stare and knew that they needed to leave right then. Grandmother and grandson have not been able to get this experience out of their minds. Grandson in particular says he is still upset about the way the animal looked at him. Grandmother thinks that they may have disturbed an animal while it was feeding on an elk or deer. They never did see another car or any people down the road to the beaver dam. Grandmother surmised that the nearby forest fires this year may have pushed both the ungulates and the sasquatch into Wahlstrom Hollow in search of food.Grandmother said she will not go back in there alone, but would like to look for prints and other signs left by the animal grandson saw. I have made plans to accompany her there to look for physical evidence. The grandson has returned home to a different state. I will report what we find after I return from the on-site visit.On-Site Visit Update - 8/22/07I spent over an hour with the female witness, exploring the area where the sounds and sighting occurred. She was very credible and was able to give me a detailed description of how the events unfolded on-site. We did not find any direct evidence of sasquatch presence. We did find a large bedding area (sasquatch or elk herd?) and two thirty foot aspens bent across the road leading to the beaver pond (like an arbor). All the elk sign was at least a few days old, so the herd had apparently moved on to another grazing area. Presumably the sasquatch followed.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length about the incident and found him to be a very serious and credible witness regarding his report of a series of tracks that he discovered is fresh snow while elk hunting.  Although this track find had occurred 30-years ago, the witness was very consistent and offered great detail about the incident.  He is now retired from the commercial airline industry and currently resides in Texas.  He is an avid outdoorsman with extensive experience hunting and camping in the backcountry.  As stated in his report above, he came upon this set of tracks while elk hunting in the Mt. Zirkel Wilderness area north of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. This is a remote area that is accessible only by foot or horseback; they were about 15-miles from the trailhead. He and two other hunters (all on horseback) had left their camp to look for elk as a snowstorm (heavy wet snow) had just ended.  They had jumped some elk but were not able to get a shot and decided to head back to camp for lunch when they saw a set of tracks and decided to investigate.  He described these tracks as about 12 to 13 inches in length with a wide, arch-less print similar to a human but wider and with only four toes that he could see. He compared the track size to his size 9 1/2 pack boot.  In the timber where the snow was only a few inches deep, the tracks were very clear and easy to see that they were human-like and clearly not made by a bear.  With the exception of areas where the creature stopped to mill around, he said that the creature's stride was about the same as his stride if he were walking fast.  The other two hunters, who also witnessed the tracks decided to head back to camp to prepare for an afternoon hunt, while he decided to investigate further.  He followed the tracks in total for approximately a half-mile until his horse (and he as well) got spooked as they ventured into the black timber and aspens.  His horse sniffed the tracks at one point and spooked considerably and he though this unusual, for his horse was a seasoned mountain horse, familiar with the smell of wildlife. He noted that he could even shoot his gun while riding this horse and the horse would not spook. He circled above the timberline around the heavy timber where the tracks went and there were no apparent exit tracks - he said that he was sure that whatever made those tracks was still in the timber, as his horse continued to act in a nervous, spooked manner. The fact that his horse was extremely nervous was what caused him to give up following the tracks further.  He said that there was no unusual noise (no wood knocks or walking sounds) and no odor.  After leaving the area, he headed back to camp to show the tracks to his wife (the camp cook), as the track way passed only about 100 yards from their camp. She remarked to him that they had found a set of young Bigfoot tracks. Based on discussions with the witness, I believe this to be a credible Class B account.  The fact that the snow had just fallen that morning, the remoteness of the area, the multiple witness of the tracks, and the length of the track way rules out the possibility of a hoax. The BFRO database has three reports #16661, #1373, and #1372 that are relatively close to this incident.  While talking with him, he assured me that he saw these tracks - they were real and not like anything in the wild that he had ever encountered before.  In light of his bear hunting experience, he said that these clearly were not made by a bear.The witness offered two more related incidents for that area.  He and his wife, along with some friends were horse camping northeast of Clark, CO near Diamond Park about 25 miles North of Steamboat Springs.  Above camp where the horses were tethered, they heard a loud screech or scream in the night like nothing they have ever heard.  He said it was chimp-like, not like an elk, hawk, owl, cougar or coyote.  Later, they saw a movie / documentary about Bigfoot and the Sasquatch vocalizations recorded and aired in this documentary were very similar to those that he and his wife had heard years before.  The other incident was the one he mentioned in his initial report about an incident or maybe a local legend that occurred in the California Park area around the 1972 timeframe.  I only mention it as it was told to me by the witness. He said that when he told the local deputy sheriff (later to become the Sherriff of Routt County) about his track find, the deputy told him of an incident that was a matter of record and subsequent investigation.  Three hunters hunting the California Park area northeast of Steamboat Springs, CO were leaving the area because of a heavy snow storm that had started.  They had put their rifles behind the seat of their pick-up truck and were in the process of putting tire chains on the vehicle.  They jacked-up one side and installed the chains and were in the process of doing the other side when one of the hunters said - look at that bear approaching on two legs.  What they actually saw was not a bear but a large, primate-like animal with heavy reddish-brown fur walking on two legs, with a human or ape-like face approaching the truck.  The hunters jumped into the vehicle and closed the doors, the animal approached, and according to them became aggressive.  They drove away rapidly, clipping a tree and leaving the remaining chains and jack-stand.  They reported the incident to the Routt County Sherriff\u0092s office and allegedly filled out a sworn statement or report.   Later on, a team from the Sherrif's office investigated the incident and found where they had left the chains and jack-stand and where they had collided with a tree as they hastily drove off.  No tracks were visible due to the new snowfall.  Although this is a third-hand story, it is interesting in that it is in an area near where other Class A and B reports have been documented.",
