The way our camp was laid out was that all of us girls (two sisters, their friends and a friend of mine) were all staying in one big army tent. My brother and his friend were in a smaller tent off to the east closer to the drop off to the lake. Then my parents were in their own tent at the far west end of the campsite. There had been a lot of trouble with bears that summer so all campers were advised to hang their food high up in the trees. My Dad did that and I remember him standing under the bag of food a good three feet over his head about 10 to 15 feet from the door to our tent to the left. My Dad was 5'10\".",

I did not have the impression that they were interested in the food bag itself, but they were standing directly under it. Do I think it was persons in hairy outfits standing in our campsite in the middle of the night? No. It did feel strangely like a staged event though. That has always been a mystery to me.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I called M on August 18, 2006. She now lives in the state of Washington.After discussing her incident I asked if she would be able to give an artist enough details to make a good sketch.  She said she didn't see enough details for a good sketch. There was just enough moonlight and star light to see a clear silhouette of the figures. As she stated above, she heard an odd sound which woke her up. Consequently she quietly moved to the tent door flap on her belly, expecting to see a bear. Standing on two legs before her were two very tall unknown creatures that were very tall and large, especially around their chest and shoulder areas. When she made a gasping sound both creatures immediately turned to look in her direction. She could momentarily see the moonlight reflecting off of their eyes.  She said, \u0093When they turned to look at me, it was like two persons at a dinner party being startled by the sound of something falling on the floor loudly.\" She added, \"They must have had necks; they just weren't highly definable or visible due to the hair around the neck. Anyway, they turned their heads as they looked down at me, then they both seemed to look back at each other and then back down at me again.\u0094  The figures moved off in different directions from where they were standing and quietly disappeared into the darkness.Her observation lasted about 5 or 6 seconds. She was about 15 to 20 feet away from them, on her belly, looking up at them from her tent door.  She saw the side profile of them -- the right side of the smaller one and the left side of the larger one. As they moved away she noticed the hair hanging from their long strong arms and back.  The creatures seemed to be dark in color, could have been ether black or dark brown.  She did not see any facial features, just the eyes that briefly reflected the moonlight.M saw the Patterson footage a couple of years after her encounter. She is very credible.",
