            "Observed": "I was out trail riding in a remote part of the Ocala National Forest when I became stuck in a mud hole. I was out there for several hours waiting for someone to come pull me out. What got my attention first was the sound of someone hitting something against a tree which striked me as odd considering where I was at and I didn't hear any other vehicles prior to the knock so I proceeded to approach the sounds after walking about 300 yards away from my vehicle I saw what I thought was a huge man in a ghillie suit striking a pine tree with a large stick as I got closer I realized it was not a man but a huge creature that I will never forget as long as I live. It had a huge chest probably 60in. across and though it was in a slumped standing position it had to be 8 feet tall with long muscular arms and long chest and mid section like its legs were shorter than chest area. As I was trying slowly to back away to get back to my truck I stepped on a stick and it immediately turned to look at me using its whole body to do so and then it ran off caring stick in a graceful stride through the woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Winess was 4 wheeling in a Jeep in a remote area of Ocala National Forest. After getting stuck and waiting for a couple hours by his vehicle, he began to hear what he thought was someone hitting a tree. After several knocks, he became curious and slowly walked thru the forest and toward the noise. After about 300 yards, near a small clearing, he could see what he thought was a large man in a ghillie hunting suit, banging a large pine tree with a 3' to 4' stick/branch. Quickly he realized this was far too big to be a man, and the ghillie suit was actually hair. He described the animal as appx 8 feet tall, reddish brown in color with some grey, massive chest and arm muscles, longer than a normal torso and shorter, tough and powerful legs. The face was flat, a slight peak at the top of the head, long arms, and the hair was shorter on its back, calves, and face. It would strike the tree with the stick that it held in one hand. When the witness realized what he was actually looking at, he started to slowly back up but stepped on a branch. This alerted the creature and it turned its entire upper half toward his direction. When it saw the witness, it turned again and ran, in a most unusual fashion, into the deeper forest. He described the movement as extremely graceful and with purpose. It almost seemed to glide through the forest with very little effort, yet faster than any man could ever move. It only moved on two legs, slightly bent, but not stooped over. There was no stumbling or unsure steps. Stating it was the master of its environment. And unlike a retreating bear that can sound like a freight train with branches and saplings breaking, this animal made no noise as it retreated. ",
