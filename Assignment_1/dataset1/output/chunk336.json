At night she would go out for a cigarette and I'd join her because she would hear stuff. We started to hear knocks just about every night. Our bedroom was right by the river. The river is probably 20+ feet from the house. One night we heard knocks really loud and then sounded like splashing through the water. The river is only a few feet deep there and about 6' in the deep holes. Never heard any howls or anything, just quite a few knocks. It was so intense for her, that she wanted to move. She didn't believe in bigfoot/sasquatch or anything. Now she believes and is spooked out.",
