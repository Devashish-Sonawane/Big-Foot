I have never seen any animal that eats pine needles? The one reason I mention this is because I seen another dropping like this the next day at another location. This one was very large 13\u0094 long and 3\u0094 in diameter. In this area I noticed a distinctive marker of stacked rocks.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "R.C. called me on the evening of October 15, 2008 and he went over what he experienced while he was hunting in the D-8 deer area of California. This witness and some friends went hunting together, but R.C. decided to take off, by foot, on his own to spend a night dry camping by himself. During that evening he heard just one loud low guttural noise that emanated from an animal's throat and/or mouth. This noise started out real sharp, then carried for a few seconds and then nothing.  I asked the question, was this a tree popping sound as you described in your report?  R.C. stated, \"that I only used that in an attempt to describe to others, like my friends that I went hunting with, what I heard that first night.\"Later on during that night, there was a light rain that fell, and when he got up the next morning, everything was damp. The first print that was observed, he took a cell phone picture of it, and it was freshly made that previous night. A short distance later he came across a set of tracks that he followed for over 75 yards, he observed and followed 10 to 12 tracks that were heading in an easterly direction through a mountain saddle. The first print he could make out had at least two distinguishable toes and a ridge about 4\" above the back of the heal. The other prints did not seem to show any toes, but he knew they weren't bear tracks because he didn't see any claw marks in those fresh tracks.  He attempted to describe those tracks to his friends, but they told him that they were probably just bear tracks and nothing more. R.C. knows there are bears in this area, but not with 13\" plus tracks and walking on two legs. He had a difficult time making a stretch between those tracks. He also stated that he never seen any deer that next morning. R.C. observed two old scat piles, one up where he observed the tracks, and the other one was down where he was camped and he hunted the following day. The rock stacking consisted of several 2 1/2' diameter flat rocks stacked together. The pile looked like it was made so a person could use it as a seat.In summary: I do believe that R.C. came across several small fresh sasquatch tracks and possible sasquatch scat. This witness has worked for a construction company over 20 years, is a family man with a very large family and he was very believable in his rendition of retelling his story. This is the only photo that was taken by the witness using his cell phone. This photo attempts to show two toes and the rest of the footprint that was not measured. The measurements in the report were only estimates.",

            "Observed": "My husband has described a hairy biped that has been seen by him on at least 2 occassions, and by his father on one occasion on Brindley Mountain in Morgan County Alabama. This biped is well known to residents of this side of the mountain. I have always been sceptible, thinking perhaps they are seeing bears or such. My husband is a seasoned outdoorsman however, and he rarely mistakes wildlife. In summer of 99, my husband was clearing land for a family member close to the bluff where sightings were reported off and on. I was sitting on a car watching him in a tree, (hes a tree surgeon). I happened to look off toward the tree line for no reason that I recall, and I saw perhaps several hundred feet off, a tall reddish manlike creature with no apparent neck, standing off in the shadows of the treeline. I looked up at my husband and gestured toward the area. Upon looking back, the creature was gone. My husbands nephew was also sitting next to me, and he saw the same thing I saw. I still to this day wonder what in the world I saw. I know bear, having seen many, and having travelled out west, and this was no bear. Since that incident, my husband was hunting, and he and his father saw from their tree posts the same creature. He would have to tell you the details. He has had I believe one other sighting, but there are many accounts within his family and surrounding neighbors on the bluff. I have heard screams late at night around 2 or 3 am, that no one can match them to any certain animal. They are very similar to sound files we have heard online. Very much like a bobcat/hounddog combo. It is like a howl,scream very loud and drawn out. We continue to watch for further evidence, but have not had or heard of any activity for a couple of seasons to date.",
