            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and met him at his home. The witness went into great detail about a series of events. The home is surrounded by woods on all sides. He and his family have had the feeling of being watched several times. He had a friend that would come over to go mushroom hunting. The friend returned from the woods frightened, saying that he felt like he was surrounded and was being escorted out of the woods. He never came back to mushroom hunt.Just before Christmas of 2012 the witness put up Christmas lights along his porch and bushes in the front of his home. While doing so the witness said that a large bush 50 yards from him and along the edge of the woods started to shake. The witness was quite upset and could not see what was making the bush shake. The family hears distant vocalization frequently. He said the howls match those on our site and what he has heard onFinding Bigfoot. The witness walked me to the location where he had seen an animal walking up the ridge as he pulled his vehicle into his lane from the paved highway. He was only able to watch the animal for 15 seconds as it walked through the woods andout of sight over the ridge. In summary:\u0095 The animal was 7 to 8 feet tall.  \u0095 The animal was huge and weighed over 350 lbs.\u0095 The hair was dark brown in coloring. \u0095 The animal was about 80 yards from the car.
