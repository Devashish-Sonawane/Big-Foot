            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with both witnesses via a conference call. I find both women to be very credible.Details that can be added: * The sisters were driving through the area one week after Hurricane Hermine. Flooding and standing water were observed.* They were traveling at approximately 50 miles an hour when the passenger saw the creature on the right side of the two lane road. Distance away from the subject was approx. 50 yards. The passenger had the best view of the subject, including its face as it turned to look at them. * The driver witnessed the back side of the subject as it slipped into the woods. It took two steps to cross the road and it was gone. They turned around and filmed the woods where the creature had disappeared, thinking it might return. They were both in shock for hours. * Estimated weight of the subject is between 550 and 700 lbs.* Witnesses stated the subject had \"Bowling Ball\" sized shoulders, meaning they were literally....as large and thick as a bowling ball. They both expressed that the arms were longer than the subject in the Patterson footage of 1967, but stated that the hair looked very much the same.* The shoulders were approx. 4 feet in width, and that the subject was VERY muscular and thick. It did appear to have a slight waist.*The subject appeared to be aging or mature. Its hair was black with gray on the end. The hair was 2 to 2.5 inches. Parts of its gray hair were matted and sticking out. * They stated that the head seemed small compared to the rest of its body. And the shape of the head was odd. No neck or ears were observed. * They called to report their sighting to the Levy County Sheriff. The person they talked to did not sound surprised about the sighting. They were asked if they lived in the area and when they responded that they did not, they were told that someone would be sent to the area to investigate. The Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuge (LSNWR) is part of the United States National Wildlife Refuge System.The 53,000-acre (210 km2) wildlife refuge was established in 1979 to protect one of the largest undeveloped river delta systems in the United States.The Suwannee River and nearby bottomland hardwood swamps, pine forests, cypress domes, tidal creeks, and vast salt marshes provide habitat for thousands of creatures every year.",

            "Observed": "I have a sighting and other occurences to report. Its been about 3 years now since my friend Dan and I saw it. We were walking along a dirt/road trail along the focka canal system to find a good bass spot, as we were walking I thought I saw large brownish colored legs ahead on the trail. I didnt say anything at first until Dan asked me if I saw that. I was stunned and replied \"Yea, Huge brown legs cross in front of us and he replied \" I thought it was just my eyes\". The sasquatch was in a group of trees next to the canal I guess checking us out. The reason I am saying this is because we heard and saw the branches in front of us russling. We were honestly scared and backed away slowly. Now Dan is a officer in the Navy now working I believe out of Miami. He is a very credible none bs type of person. I myself is a biologist and I am super observent of my surroundings. The only reason why we just saw the legs is because we were looking down in front of us so we didnt step on one of the resident water moccasins. Since then I have been going to the same location to try to see if \"its\" still there and yes \"it\" is. I havent seen it since the first time but I found an area off the trail that had almost like I guess beds?!? Basically it was long saw grass bundled up together and it was obvious something large has sat in it. Also near by I found skelatal remains and hair from a bear that seemed to literally have been ripped in half. I have also spent many nights fishing in the location and near it and have heard undeniable 'calls\" that seem like it came from some sort of primate. Similar to a very deep howler monkey call.  I have a lot of experience with primates from my studies throughout Latin America. Based on that I KNOW it was a primate call. There was another occurence when I was with my friend Chris on Turner River Rd. off Rt.41 South of Ochopee,Fl. We were crawfish hunting after a evening shower and heard some odd noises in the woods across the canal system. Then we smelt a very odd odor I wouldnt say it smelt like rotten eggs like all the other reports but maybe like methane gas. We moved on about 2 miles down the road and was picking more crawfish out of the swamp and heard the same noises followed by the same smell. This occured for another 30 minutes or so and we felt uncomfortable and left.",
