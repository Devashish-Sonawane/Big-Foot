I BELIEVE THEY WERE MOVING BECAUSE OF THE STORM THEY WHERE HEADED EAST AT WITCH TIME WAS A WOODED AREA. THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER TIME WHEN THEY WERE SEEN AND IT WAS IN THE CITY OF WILLISTON  I WAS WORKING FOR THE CITY AND WENT FOR A CALL AND IT WAS  IN THE DUMPSTER AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, THIS ONE WAS A YOUNG ONE, HE WAS ABOUT 5 FOOT TALL, WHEN THE TRUCK LIGHTS HIT HIM IT RAN",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with LP over the phone and found her to be forthright and sincere in relating her encounters.In the Summer of 1991, LP was working for the city as an animal control officer. Upon getting complaints of a dumpster being tampered with, (finding garbage strewn on the ground) LP went out at 3am one night to see if she could catch the \u0091culprits\u0092 in action. Thinking that she would find either humans or raccoons pilfering through the dumpster, she rode up to it with her headlights turned off and her window down. According to LP, as she got within five feet of the dumpster she saw the silhouette of a human-shaped figure. As soon as she turned the headlights on she saw what she described as a \u0091Bigfoot\u0092 standing in front of the dumpster. \u0093The thing was about six foot tall and was covered in dark brownish-black hair. Its arms hung real low, down past its knees. As soon as my headlights hit it, it looked at me like it was scared. I could see the eyes; they were totally black. It had hair on its face, but not around its eyes or mouth. Right away it started moving off. It didn\u0092t run, but sort of walked real fast in a weird jumping-skipping strut. Not like a person would run. I think I saw it for about thirty seconds before I got my truck in reverse and got out of there. While I was backing up, I did notice this really bad odor. It was like a wet dog smell mixed with rotten eggs. \"Its one of those smells you just can\u0092t ever forget.\u0094When asked to describe its face, LP told me, \"It looked exactly like the same way the \u0091Mexican Werewolf\u0092 boy\u0092s face looks. It didn\u0092t have hair around the eyes and mouth. (The Mexican Wolf Boy has a condition called Congenital Generalized Hypertrichosis or The Werewolf Syndrome.  Hypertrichosis means \"extra hair\", and in the case of the Mexican Wolf Boy, is caused by a inherited defective chromosome which results in an abnormal amount of hair on the body and face.)A month or so later, in August of the same year, LP and her sister were driving south down State Rd 121 during the early evening. LP noted that there was a severe storm brewing in the west but there was enough light out to see easily without using any headlights. Just after passing a golf course and driving through a heavily wooded section they both saw what LP described as \"four bigfoots crossing the road\" about 30 yards in front of them.According to LP, they were heading east and she and her sister saw them walking single file from a very dense part of the woods towards the other side of the road, which was also very dense.\u0093The first one was the biggest, I'm sure it was a male. It was about eight-foot tall and completely covered with dark brown hair. I think the next one was a female because it was a little smaller, about seven-foot tall. Then there was a younger one, about six-foot tall and then an even smaller one, about four to five-foot tall. They were all covered with the same colored hair, dark brown. This might sound strange, but they were all holding hands. And they didn\u0092t seem to be in that much of a hurry. They all had really long legs and they all had really long strides, so I know they could have moved faster if they wanted to. I think they were going slower so the smaller one at the back could keep up.\u0094After the sighting, LP and her sister did not want to stop. LP stated that during the encounter she did not experience any unusual noises or odors. LP did state that she believes that the 'bigfoots' she saw were trying to run away from the impending storm.  \"The way they held hands, it was like the male was leading them to safety. I really don't know. All I know for sure was that it wasn't bears, and it wasn't people. It was bigfoots. I saw that one at the dumpster, and I know what they look like. These were bigfoots.\"When asked if the six-foot tall bigfoot she saw crossing the road could have been the same six-foot tall bigfoot she saw at the dumpster, LP said that she wasn't sure. But she was adamant that the four bigfoots she saw crossing the road must have been a family unit. \"Why else would they have been holding hands and traveling together like that? That big male leading them away from that storm?\"The area in question of both sightings happened in and around Williston, Florida. Still fairly rural, but more populated since 1991, most of this area is comprised of farmlands and woodlands that are interspersed by small urban communities. I did ask LP if her sister would be willing to speak to me. She laughed and said that her sister would probably kill her if she knew that she had submitted this report. Her sister has bad memories of this event and doesn't like to talk about it. But she did say that she would ask her. Will wait and see. This report is very close geographically to another report that occurred in 1991, Report #1407. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness recalls the event well. She was driving about 10 MPH, rounding a sharp corner when she saw out of her drivers side window about 10 boar feeding about 10 feet from the road.  Approx 30-40 feet behind the pigs, there is a large boulder. Next to the boulder was a dark, long-curly haired sasquatch sitting on its knees, observing the boar.  Due to her slow speed, she states she observed the creature for about one minute.The witness insisted it was not a mis-identification, stating that, even though it was dark, there was a clear sky and was able to clearly rule out any possible known animals.  She was not able to clearly observe the face of the creature, but did note that the mass of the creature was much higher than that of a bear, and that the hair on the head was black, which turned to a brown color further down the body.  She remembers that the creature was over 5 feet tall, crouched over.  She also noted the broadness of the shoulders.After observing this, she turned around at the next intersection, and went back to confirm what she saw.  It took her about 3 minutes to return back to the location, where she again observed to boars and saw the boulder, but what she had originally observed was no longer there.  She turned her high-beams on in the area and looked for eye-shine, but none was seen.After looking at the location on Google Earth, the area is rural, and is very close to the Green Swamp, and easily connects to Ocala via Leesburg.
