He also stated that the dog was calm and acting normal prior to coming outside and after getting outside. He said that after he noticed the shadow of a figure by his shed did he then begin to notice a strong pungent smell almost like a wet deer but alot stronger. He also noticed it was at this time that his dog became very nervous and wanted to return to the house.He used the shed height as a gauging tool to estimate the height of the shadow, the shed is approximately 7 feet at the roof line. He has also noticed several tree bows that block some of the old logging roads that are live fresh trees not disturbed by the logging. The trees are 4-10 inches in diameter by his estimations. He has been in this residence since April of 2002, shortly after moving in he witnessed a hardwood tree getting shaken very vigorously just inside the treeline but didn't make much of it until a few days later when he decided to see what had happened over there. It was then that he said he discovered the tree was over 10 inches in diameter.",
