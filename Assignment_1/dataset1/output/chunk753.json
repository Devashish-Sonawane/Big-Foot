We seen it about 40 to 30 yards away and were already driving kinda fast. I am guessing about 15 to 10 miles an hour. My girlfriend ask me \"what is that\" I looked to see a hairy head moving along the road. I drove up the road toward the place it was seen. when I reached the place it was already gone. I grabbed my pistol and jumped out to look up the ridge in the direction it was running, nothing, no noise, nothing. My girlfriend was scared and yelling at me to get back in.",
