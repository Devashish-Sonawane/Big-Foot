            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness on 5/03/02. The sighting took place in 1978 or 1979 near Spanish Camp, in Wharton County, TX. Wharton County is 75 miles south of Houston. It was a hot, bright sunny day. The witness was thirteen years old. He was plowing bottomland on his family farm. While turning under a tree a branch hit the throttle on the tractor and killed the engine. He got off the tractor to start it back up, when he noticed a dark figure 200-250 yards away (his report states 175-200 yards). While trying to figure out what he was looking at, the figure started leaning from one side to the next. As if trying to get a better look at the witness. The creature was curious about the witness. He then saw the creature\u0092s arm move a branch out of the way of its view. The witness could tell the creature was very tall and heavy in stature. The fence the creature was standing next to was very high. The witness could not make out any facial details. The sighting was more of a silhouette. The best description of the creature is in the April 2002 issue of Texas Fish & Game. The figure in the background on the page best describes it. The sighting lasted 90 seconds. Once the witness figured out what he was watching he became frightened and took off running as fast as he could. He stopped running and realized he should use the tractor to leave the area. He started up the tractor and looked back to see the creature. It was gone. No sounds or smells were observed. Soon after he arrived back home he told his parents what he had seen. They did not laugh or seemed shocked. Although the witness had never heard of prior sightings in the area, the locals always spoke of strange goings on in the bottoms.",
