Due to additional observations that have been privately been described, the actual chance of this being a sasquatch is a distinct possiblity. This is especially noteworthy since vocalization sounds have been compared favorably. The witness and his family have since moved away from the area. Regarding patterns to when the vocalizations are heard,  it seems to be seasonal.  .",
