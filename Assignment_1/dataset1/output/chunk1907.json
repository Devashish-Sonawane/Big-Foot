She said, \"they were quiet on horseback.\" She saw it first and tried to determine what it was. It seemed to be picking at something, but was not carrying anything when it moved. It looked at her and her horse and then stood up. It sprinted up a steep hill on two legs. She saw arms swing. She could see it go through the trees. It was about six feet tall, very dark brown to black. At that distance the face only seemed flat, no bear nose seen.She did not detect any foul odor. The dog did not have any unusual odor when it came back. While this area is populated, it has a mix of farms, hay fields and orchards. It is the northern end of the Chehelam Mountains. The witness had seen cougar in this area. She now lives in Alaska and observes bear often.    ",
