            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone, who was pretty shaken up by what he heard that night.  The first scream lasted 2-3 seconds, and sounded about 100 yards away.  About 8-10 seconds later the second scream was heard.  This is the first time something like this has happened since they moved to the area.The witness has stated that since they heard the screams, his dog has been acting very weird and doesn't want to go outside.  It has also been barking a lot and 'going crazy' in the middle of the night.  The witness himself has had a feeling of being watched, but has never seen anything upon shining his flashlight into the wooded area behind his house.  His daughter has stated that she heard a growl come from the woods, and has smelled a very bad garbage-like odor coming from the area.  Within a few days of the scream episode, the witness stated that while outside around 11 pm he yelled out, and heard from about 50 feet into the forest bipedal footsteps run away from the house.It should be added that the witness is a very experienced hunter, and he has never heard anything while hunting like the screams he heard that night.  The 45,000 acre Allegan State Game Area is about 2 miles from this location.  The forest begins about 20 feet from the witness' home, which leads into a creek-fed swamp about 100 feet into the forest.  ",
