The full moon helped a lot to see, but I saw nothing. this all happened on January 15, 2011. And ever since then I have been trying to get the call again. I will keep trying.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I grew up in the area of this report and spent a great deal of time hiking, mountain biking, and hunting in the forests and fishing in the lakes and streams.  I have hunted on the property where this report comes from.  While I have not experienced any evidence of possible Sasquatch evident in this area, there is plentiful cover that would allow something that does not want to be seen to remain undetected.  Gull Lake and nearby Little Long Lake are connected by streams which connect other nearby lakes and rivers.  There are also forest preserve areas including the Kellogg Bird Sanctuary, Kellogg Forest, the Michigan State University Biological Station and corresponding agricultural farm areas administered by MSU.  The area also hosts a large deer population.  Last year it was hit by Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) or an acute, infectious, often fatal viral disease of some wild ruminants.  While the Michigan DNR did not specify Barry County as an area hit by the disease, surrounding counties were hit and dead deer were found just off of the property near a pond.  One of the indicators of the disease is a high fever and deer move to water to drink during the final stages of the disease.  Even with this sickness the deer population is substantial and anything preying on deer would find this location a great place to hunt.When I first met with this witness she was just 14 and I was interested in the area so I figured I would check it out even though she was so young.  With her mom along for the trek we checked out the location.  She was honest and not 100% sure of what she had experienced.  She did state that on an earlier night she had heard some branches snapping and decided to \u0093Whoop into the woods.\u0094 She thought she heard a growl-like response but was unsure if it was a dog.  This is why she stood there and listened after hearing the next \u0093growl-whoop.\u0094  We checked out the quad trails and found the twisted branch that had been blocking the trail.  It did look manipulated but I could not tell if it was initially made by a person.  I could have broken and bent the tree and the witness had moved it away from the trail. We moved it back into the trail to get an idea of what it had originally looked like when she came upon it while riding the quad.  We then moved it safely off of the trail.  I did not photograph this because it had been manipulated after the fact.I shared vocals with the witness.  I actually started with known animals like coyotes and barred owls.  None of these were what she heard and since these are the some of the normal sounds of the woods this intrigued me.  I then played a few links from vocals I have captured in other areas in Michigan and one in particular was closest.\u0093Roar Vocal\"   This sounds like the last part of the vocal.\u0093Growl Scream\"  Right around the 13 second mark.Fast forward to now and I decided to re-connect with this witness.  I was heading to that side of the state to visit my parents so I decided to re-interview the young lady who is now seventeen.  She admitted that it seemed like a long time ago when the activity happened.  She was also reluctant to make the sound she heard on video.  After hearing herself make the sound she wondered if I could play around with it to make it lower but I wanted to keep it as she had made it.  She wanted me to tell you, as a reader, that she wishes it were lower and much louder.  It was an exciting experience for her but she was not as afraid as one might think.  She was in a familiar location and the house was a few steps away.I feel that this witness heard something in the woods.  The volume and sound as she recalls it makes it less likely that this is an owl or a person randomly in the forest so late at night.  The fact that she dismissed other known sounds also points to this one being a more interesting call than most regular woodland sounds.  She was honest, mature and polite.  She was a good sport about being on film and I received her mother\u0092s permission to meet with and video her.  Her mom was right there the whole time.  I suggest always having a parent around when working with a young witness.  Did she hear a Sasquatch?  The area could support one with food and cover but it is going to take more evidence and more witnesses like this young woman to prove it.  Please see the attached video of our interview.",
