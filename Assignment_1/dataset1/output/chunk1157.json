It was tall, not slim but not thick and covered in grayish - brownish hair. It never turned to look at me and just loped across the road and off in the dark.

She was heading home from work.   Her route home takes her across rural country roads.   She was driving around 35 mph when the creature stepped out of the tree line on to the road 30 feet ahead of her.  She slowed her car down to avoid colliding with the creature and was approximately 10 feet from it.   She noticed it was around 6-7\u0092 tall, medium build, hairy and had a loping walk.  The creature did not turn towards the vehicle at all, just continued across the road to the other tree line.   The sighting lasted 10-15 seconds. The area where the event took place is a rural country area, pine woods, and sporadic houses. ",
