He and his wife recalled the encounter in detail.The garbage bags were white and estimated to be hung 9 to 10 feet from the ground. The animal entered the camp sometime after midnight. The witness was not sure of the time but remembers it was late.During the entire time of the encounter the animal moved bipedal on two legs and never went down to all fours. It was seen swatting at the garbage bags until it grabbed hold of one of the bags. It then walked off into the woods with the garbage bag at an estimated 5 to 6 feet from the ground while the animal was carrying it.The animal looked bigger then a bear. There was no smell associated with the animal and no tracks found.The witness did not follow the animal into the woods after it took the garbage bags. No features could be made out and the vehicle had the rear facing toward the hanging garbage bags, so the headlamps could not be illuminated on the animal.",
