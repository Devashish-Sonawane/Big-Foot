When I retraced the path the next morning, I was wearing sneakers. As I walked on the gravel, it made the walking on gravel sound that you would expect to hear if a person were wearing shoes. The noise I heard had no such sound, as if no shoes were being worn.  I took my shoes off and attempted to walk on the gravel. No way! Even with \"summer feet\" I could not walk with my barefeet on that gravel.",

We were sleeping, when I was awakened by heavy footsteps walking by the tent. The footsteps continued towards the picnic table and stopped.  I heard the clanking of silverware, very slight however.  Soon thereafter the footsteps walked out the other end of the campsite. Definetly was a bipedal creature. Very heavy footsteps, that were rapid.  It walked with a purpose.It was so dark and so heavily wooded that I'm still amazed at how quikly it moved.  I had an opportunity to unzip the tent and grab the flashlight when it paused at the picnic table, but the heavy footsteps,the pitch dark, 3year old daughter whom I was thinking about how to protect if necessary, made me pause with fear.  I'm absolutley convinced that I heard Bigfoot.  I searched in the AM for tracks, but the summer was dry. No soft ground, mud or anything.",
