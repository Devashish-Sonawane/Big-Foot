            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness is a retired carpenter that lives down state and comes up to to the UP many times a year, hunting and fishing the area. He has done impressive carpentry work at one of the local national parks as well. In addition to submitting this report he called us, excited to share. I called him and he sent me his photos. Many times he and his buddies have experienced home-run knocks, charging, paralleling, interesting track and hair finds.He is positive nobody else was there that morning. He feels as if he surprised the track makers, insisting they were recently made.Knowing the area well and where other folks would be going into the area or parking, he knew he was alone.  With the weather being in the 40s its hard to imagine anyone barefoot, let alone crossing the river in that depth. Our waters up here are still very cold that time of year. Witness described the location, the gorges and the creek meeting Carp River, where these tracks were found. Too much time had passed to look for the tracks now. Below are the photos he took that morning. The knife is 8\" long and he said the fish looked as if a bite had been taken out of it. We were unable to get the video to me from his phone, he explained that the video is of the fish with tracks around it, two sizes, one a bit larger than the other.  He admits he wasn't thinking very good at the time, as far as measurements and collecting evidence. One-third of St. Ignace is Native American, the second-oldest city founded by Europeans in Michigan. Various cultures of Native Americans have inhabited the area for thousands of years.",
