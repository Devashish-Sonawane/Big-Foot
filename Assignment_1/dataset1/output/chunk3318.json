            "Observed": "My husband and I were jugging on the Missouri River.  We had the jugs all set out and was floating down behind them, when we saw something big and hairy on the bank getting a drink.  At first we could not see it that well, but the closer we got, the better we could see it.  It stood upon two legs and looked around for a few minutes.  It did not see us at first and it did not hear us because we had the motor off and I guess he finely saw us because he walked back up the bank into the tree area.  As he was walking, we could see trees falling, it looked like some type of machiner was going through there knocking them down, but there was no noise other than the sound of the trees being knocked down.  All my husband and I could do was look at each other.  I guess because neither one of us could believe what we saw for years.  We did not tell anyone because we did not want anyone to think we were crazy.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Bob and Mary via telephone in regard to their submitted sighting. The following details can be added to their sighting report.While jugging on the Missouri River, they were floating with the current, not using the boat motor. Bob was back paddling with oars to stay behind the floating jugs. When they came around a river bend, they both observed something very dark brown and hairy sitting on its haunches approximately 300 feet downriver on the water edge. This was very easy to see because the riverbank was light-colored, consisting of white rock and sand.  As they continued drifting closer, they observed it drinking water by cupping one hand and placing it to its mouth. This continued as they drifted closer. They got as close as 50 feet upriver from the sasquatch, when it looked up and noticed their presence. It then stood up and walked into the woods, which was approximately 30 feet from the waterline. The speed in which it walked was described to me as about the same speed as the sasquatch in the Patterson/Gimlin film. After disappearing into the woods, trees were heard being knocked down or broken for approximately one minute. Also noted was the presence of a wet, musky smell, like a wet dog when they were at the closest point of their encounter. The sasquatch was described as about 6 to 7 feet tall, having very dark brown, almost black appearing hair which was approximately 5 to 6 inches long.  The hair was not matted or in any disarray, just hanging lengthwise down the body.  No hair was seen on the palms of the hands, around the face (between the forehead and mouth) or on the bottoms of the feet.  The couple described it as very man-like in appearance.  Bob also stated that he has hunted deer in this area after this initial encounter.  On different occasions he described to me that he has heard the sounds of breaking trees around him while being in the woods. He stated that this happened in the same area as the sighting and felt that it may have been the same or another sasquatch, but he never saw what was making the noise.  The couple stated that they are glad they had a close-up sighting and feel they were lucky to have this encounter.  ",
