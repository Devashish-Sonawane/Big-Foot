The following details can be added to the report:\u0095  The witness was walking perhaps 30 to 50 feet off-trail.\u0095  The witness and the creature stared at each other for approximately two seconds.\u0095  The creature\u0092s right hand was touching the stump during the encounter.\u0095  The creature was described as tall, angular, and thin.  \u0095  The witness first thought that he was looking at a woman based on the body movements.  He saw no signs of breasts or genitalia, though.  During the interview, he always referred to it as a \u0093she\u0094.  \u0095  He gauged his height estimate based on the height of his field partner, who stands at six foot, two inches.  The creature was several inches taller than his partner.\u0095  The witness did not notice if any of the edible mushroom was eaten or not.\u0095  The print was at the base of an incline less than 100 feet away.  \u0095  In the nearby stream was a very high concentration of small brook trout.  Most of the fish were between six and ten inches long.\u0095  The witness is a forest service botanist.  He has served 26 years in the military, mainly as search and rescue and special ops.",
