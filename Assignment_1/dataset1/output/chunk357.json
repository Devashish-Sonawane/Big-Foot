            "Also Noticed": "There were two unusual things to me. First, why did it pop-up and show itself when I had not previously seen it. And second, why did it run through the clearing (in my sight)until it crossed the road instead of retreating into the woods directly behind it. My theory on these two things is that it was traveling through the woods (towards the road)and came upon the clearing. Seeing the observation tower probably caused hesitation for the animal to continue, so it probably spend a little time watching for movement. Having not seen or heard any signs of life (remember, I was laying on a bench and would not be visible from the ground)it proceeded cautiously into the clearing in an effort to cross the road. When I got-up off the bench, it probably immediately saw me and stopped. It was now vulnerable to me since I was in an elevated position and it did not have the protection of the trees. I figure it probably just knelt down behind the brush (think it's called \"saw palmetto\") and waited. I didn't see it as I was coming down the tower. I believe that when I slipped and came down with a loud thud in the brush, I startled it and it popped it's head up to see what was happening. It was purely by coincidence that I just happened to be looking in its direction when its head came up. It must have realized immediately that there was no point in hiding, because we were looking right at each other. I think we both froze in that instance. After a few seconds, when it began to flee, it moved across the clearing until it crossed the road. It could have retreated much quicker into the woods behind it but I don't think that is where it wanted to go. It needed to get across that road and perhaps it panicked. I know I did!",

When it first happened, I shared the details with family and a few close friends but no one believed me. It became a topic of such ridicule that I just stopped talking about it (what was the point). I've always had a casual interest in the bigfoot dilema. When I moved (in 1974) to south florida, neighborhood kids would tell me stories of a bigfoot-like creature (they called it a \"skunk-ape\") roaming the fringes of the everglades with the occasional sighting. They said it was large (about 9'), smelly and a very swift runner. This all seemed too bizarre and I really didn't believe them. Then when I was 15 yrs. old I had my experience. I'm not about to say that what I saw was a skunk-ape, but I can say that (since my experience) I absolutely believe that animals (even large ones) can co-exist around us without our knowledge of their presence. Here's my story ....",

Upon first receiving this report, myself and a co-investigator visited the area in question for cross referencing of the places and geographic locales involved. The witness has since done likewise. Discussed also were the many differences in the park ,as to how it looked at the time of the sighting as opposed to now, among them being the fact of an entirely different tower area as to what now exists. The witness also stated he had the impression the creature in question may have started its run on all fours and ended on two legs. Again, he states that this is only an impression and cannot be one hundred percent certain. The speed of the creature was guessed to be no faster than that of the witness himself with the exception of the terrain (saw palmetto strands) that the creature moved through easily. The encounter was estimated to last approximately 15 - 20 seconds.The eyes were noted as probably black with no visible whites to them.The witness also states that he cannot unequivocally state that the creature observed was indeed a bigfoot, but it matches no other animal that he knows of.",
