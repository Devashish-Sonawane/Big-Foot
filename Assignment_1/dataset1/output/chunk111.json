This was upright walking thru my back yard! It was taller than my swing set, wider than my self and saw eye shine! All from my kitchen window! This made me a little scared! Went out trying to find prints but the ground was very hard pack as we had a below freeze at 25 degrees that night! I then called the BRFO to tell about what I had seen!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Bill one day after his encounter. Not only were the facts still clear in his mind, he was also still a little shaken. Bill is from the armed forces and a retired law enforcement officer, so things don't normally scare him. Along with this training he has a very strong skill for observation, which help in this instance. Going into his back yard to see where he observed the subject he was able to put me in the exact spot that he saw it in. After taking some measurements and size comparisons we came to the conclusion that the subject was around seven feet tall. While exploring the area, which at the time seemed an unlikely place for this situation to have occurred, I noticed a deep cut creek. This waterway goes from one side of town to the other. It has a large pipe going under the highway and is sub-grade the entire way through town. The town is small and not heavily populated. The creek was approximately six feet below the surface of the yards behind Bill's house, a perfect depth to conceal something large. Because of this green belt, the airport and the large forests on either side of this area I have no problem supporting Bill's story of his encounter. I was not able to find conclusive proof or evidence of this for the reasons he already gave, cold temperatures had frozen the ground, but I was able to see things that lead me to believe him. ",
