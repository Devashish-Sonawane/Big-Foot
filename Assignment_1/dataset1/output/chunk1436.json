I stopped on the trail when I smelled a foul smell. We did not see or hear anything at this time. We walked down to the falls the water was very low so we walked out onto the large rocks to sit, we sat talking for about 30 min. I heard a sound like trees moving then I heard nothing else so we were on our way out when we saw a very large footprint in the sandy creek bank. It was approx. 18 inches long and about 7 inches wide it had very pronounced toe prints.",

But me and my wife both saw it. I have seen my father-in-law on the side of the road a few time he stands 6ft 4in and the creature I saw was more then a foot taller and a lot wider.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone who was very skeptical about Bigfoots before this encounter. He and his wife like to drive around at night looking at wildlife along roads, they are both avid outdoors people. It was around 2 a.m., they rounded a curve and his headlights caught the creature as it was moving into the woods. He and his wife thought it was a bear at first, then noticed it was walking bipedally. It was extremely large, 7 to 8 feet in height. Very thick like a football player in pads. He compared it to his father-in-law who is 6' 4\" and 380 pounds and he said the Sasquatch dwarfed him in size. He estimated its weight at over 500 pounds. It had longer arms than a human and swung them while it walked. They were not able to see any facial features. It moved extremely quick into the woods and the sighting lasted just a few seconds, but he and his wife are convinced they saw a Sasquatch.His father-in-law's house is only a couple of miles from the sighting spot and they heard strange moan-howl vocalizations, three different nights after the encounter.This area has an extremely large whitetail deer population and other smaller mammals. The town of Seagrove is very close to the border of Montgomery County which has the most Sasquatch reports in North Carolina. The Uwharrie National Forest is just southwest of Seagrove. The area is rolling hills and woodlands and is very sparsely populated.",
