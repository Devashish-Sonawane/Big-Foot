            "Observed": "I was with my dad and a friend of his as well as his son who was a year younger than myself. We would go out just about every night to go Coon hunting. On One particular night we went to an area that had a large swamp and woods. There was a rough cut logging road running along the edge of the swamp. We had 3 coonhounds with us. We hadn't been there more than 30 minutes when the dogs started to sound off. At first they sounded normal and then they started yelping, like they were scared pups again. We all just stopped and listened. From the direction of the dogs, we could hear something breaking and snapping limbs and a deep bass growl. Then next thing we know the dogs, all 3 come running down the path past us with there tails between there legs, heading the way we came into the woods. My dad said boys lets get out of here. So we turned and ran out of the woods as well, with what ever it is still coming in our direction breaking limbs and sounding like smacking trees with another limb. When we got back to the truck the dogs where in there boxes on back of the truck, just shaking.  What was weird about all of this is these dogs we had with us at the time we have hunted bear and wildboar with them in Tennessee and they had no problem holding their own. So what ever it was they had never meet up with before and were scared.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness about this experience, and not much more detail can be added to the report.   His hunting dogs and the people he was with that day had extensive hunting experience, and the dogs have never shown this behavior previously.  The tree breaks and growl came from a swamp area, about 100-150 yards away, and followed as the dogs retreated back to the vehicles.The witness was recently reading reports that occurred years ago on the BFRO website and that spurred him to report this older incident.  The BFRO occasionally receives reports that are similar to this one - coon hunters and their dogs are intimidated/scared by something either growling, breaking sticks, or both, usually directed at the dogs. Editor's Note  (Matt Moneymaker)The location was described to Eric in more detail over the phone. The witness is a reliable military veteran. The woods in question (in 1975) would have been two miles due south of present day Summit Lake State Park.  Here is what the area looks like today from above, with the area of the incident circled in red.Unfortunately there is no comparable aerial imagery from the mid 1970's for this same area. So there's no way to know if there were bigger parcels of woods back then.  In many parts of the Midwest there are actually more forest parcels now than in the 1970's.",
