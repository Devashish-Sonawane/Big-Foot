            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, who is a retired electrical engineer and he struck me as a very sincere, honest and detail-oriented individual. He estimated that he was approximately 80-120 feet from the source of the knocks, but due to the thick woods and rolling hills, he wasn't able to see who or what was producing the knocks. The witness is an amateur photographer and he was kind enough to provide us a photo that was shot just prior to hearing the wood knocks. As is evident in the photo, the surrounding woods are indeed quite thick and there are nearby hills that could easily obscure or block his view of the source of the knocks.Even though the witness didn't see the source of the knocks, there have been several Class \"A\" sightings in this county to corroborate the fact that this witness could have heard knocks possibly coming from a bigfoot(s).Here are several other reports from Clarke county:Report #12290Report #13918Report #14144",
