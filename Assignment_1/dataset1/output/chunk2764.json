            "Observed": "It happened when my friend and I were 13. When I found out about this website, about 5 years later, I tried to post it on here but something must have gone wrong with the connection or something. Anyway, It was late winter and storming badly outside. We were outside playing, in front of her house and out of the corner of my eye, I saw a huge shadow and I remember saying \"What the hell is that?\" to my friend and before she could respond we both saw the \"BIGFOOT\" running (on two feet) on the side of the road from approx. 50ft away. We thought at first that it must be a very tall human but when it went under the streetlight, we saw fur from head to toe and it was approx. 7 to 9 ft tall. It also was running faster than I have ever seen anything else run. We both stood there in shock, unable to move or speak. I remember trying to scream but nothing came out. After it ran out of sight, we both looked at each other and ran inside to tell her mother, who obviously didn't believe a word of what we were saying. We didn't go back outside afterwards because we were terrified. To this day, we both remember it like it was last night, but no one believes our story.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with O.K. over the phone and found her to be sincere and forthright in her description of what her and her friend saw in 1999. When she was 13 years old, OK and a friend were playing near the street in front of her friend\u0092s house. She said that the weather was cold, with some snow falling and that it was getting dark. The sounds of heavy, thudding footfalls caused them to look towards the road where they saw a hair-covered creature running under a white streetlight fifty-feet away.\u0093This thing was huge\u0094, stated O.K.. \u0093Its arms and legs were much longer than a human\u0092s and it was completely covered with hair. It was dark so it was hard to tell, but I think the hair was dark brown or maybe dark gray. When it ran, it didn\u0092t look in our direction, so I couldn\u0092t see the face. But I could tell that it was eight foot tall, or taller, and that it wasn\u0092t a man. We saw it run along the side of the road for about ten seconds before we ran to the house. It ran much faster than a human could run. We were freaked out and told my friend\u0092s mother, but she didn\u0092t believe us. She just told us to stay inside for the rest of the evening.\u0094O.K. says that she still keeps in touch with her friend and to this day they both agree that what they saw was a bigfoot. O.K. even commented that when she drives past the area where she saw the bigfoot she always thinks back to that encounter.I was able to get in touch with O.K.'s friend by phone and asked her what she recalled about the incident. She immediately knew the incident I was referring to and was more than willing to speak to me.She stated that she remembers the night as being cold and snowy and that she saw a tall figure running under a streetlight. She described the figure as being over 8 foot tall, with very long arms and legs, and that it was either an over-all beige or light gray color. She was adamant that it was too large and tall to be a human and that it ran faster than a human could run. She did not recall hearing the heavy footsteps as it ran. And as with O.K., she stated that she was very frightened.The area the sighting took place in is sparsely populated and very rural.",
