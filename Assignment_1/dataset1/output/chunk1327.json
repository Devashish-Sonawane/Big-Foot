            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness, PR, was 13 years old at the time of this sighting. He and three others (his mom and her two friends) were hiking around a location where there had been recent bigfoot activity near Morton, Washington.After talking with the witness for 45 minutes, I learned that he had been close enough to see some detail of skin and eye color. PR said that the skin on the bigfoot's hand was very dark, almost black, as were the eyes. He did not notice any sclera (whites of the eyes). He was not able to see any of the nose or mouth, as it was partially hidden behind a bush. He was amazed at how clean and soft the bigfoot's hair looked. He said it was around 3-4\" long. PR described seeing an arm, hand and fingers confirming that it was not a bear that he had been looking at. He thought the bigfoot was just around his height, 5'6\", maybe a little taller.PR, his mom and her friends did not want to follow the bigfoot for fear that the whistling sounds were coming from it's mother and it might feel threatened. Therefore, for safety reasons, none of the witnesses felt that they should hang around the area looking for evidence. Upon returning to the scene later, no definitive evidence was found.Although PR was able to get a good look at the bigfoot, his mom was 60 feet up the hill from him and was not able to see it through the thick under growth. PR's mom did hear all the sounds, including the vocals, whistles, tree shaking and the two loud thuds. The two other friends had pulled up in their own jeep a bit later and were able to hear the whistles and the thrashing through the trees and brush.",
