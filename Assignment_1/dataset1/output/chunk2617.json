            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness over the phone and found him to be very credible. I then took a partner with me and met him at the site of his report and received several new details, as follows:He said when he first saw the white animal, he didn\u0092t think anything of it because it was at a distance. It seemed to be crouching or lying down near some turkeys. He told us that he thought it could possibly be a large owl or even a porcupine at first. But when he got closer to it, he was confused as to what it could possibly be. The witness is a wildlife exterminator, and very familiar with all types of wildlife in this particular area. He also used to manage a type of wildlife preserve in Florida. Again\u0097he knows animals. The creature had disappeared as he was getting his gear out of his car and turned back around. After walking into the trees, the witness was startled to see it standing in the middle of the path about 50-60 yards in front of him. At this point he said the only thing that makes sense to him is that it was a young, white Bigfoot. He saw its arms and legs. He saw the domed shape of its head, and said that at one point it stood and was swaying back and forth. At another point, it was looking at him from behind a tree. It had no feathers. It was standing on two legs and would walk quickly in and out of the trees. He said there were several points where he and the creature stared at each other for at least a minute. He wanted to get a better look at it, so he followed it until he became uneasy. He again described the actions between him and this white creature as being almost a cat-and-mouse game with it hiding and him following it. He would then try to get closer, but it would stay ahead of him. The closest he got to it was about 25-30 yards before it would turn and run or walk off. He described it as being fuzzy, and it was hard to see any facial features at that distance. One time when he approached it, it took off and went toward a small ravine. He stopped and it stopped, walked back toward him a bit, and continued to stare at him. A few times it made swiveling head movements and shuffled its feet. He confirmed that he did not feel comfortable raising his gun to it since he didn\u0092t know what it was, and he worried that it might be a neighborhood child in some kind of a costume at first. But the closer that he got to it, and the fact that it did not cry out when he began to raise his gun to look through the scope (he then lowered it quickly), convinced him that this was not the case. Although he didn\u0092t feel threatened by the animal, he did feel wary of why it seemed to be so curious about him, and why it kept showing itself to let him follow it into the woods. The creature held its ground, but he decided it was time to go, so he left quickly. ",
