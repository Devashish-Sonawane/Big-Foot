I was down at deep creek near Lake Arrowhead, Ca and I spotted something moving, very tall, standing atop a huge boulder about a mile away. I got a picture of it, but it was so far away that its a terrible photo. Everyone with me saw it, but specualted that it was just a person. Now this area where the \"thing\" was was very far away, so Im still not sure what I saw, but that exact spot was way out in the middle of nowhere.",

No unusual smells or sound were reported during the time of the sighting.Viewing the photo, the witness is correct about the figure standing on the rock being blurry. There is nothing in the photograph to provide scale to estimate the size. The photo is also too distant and blurry to identify any notable features. Link to photos on my Instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BQcAD1BjVk7/https://www.instagram.com/p/BQcAADoD8UK/The stance and position of the figure in the photograph is consistent however with other photographs and reports where a Sasquatch has been witnessed standing in an area which would provide a view of its surroundings. Witness is willing to return to the sighting location to attempt to recreate the photo and do some size estimates. Unfortunately we'll have to wait due to weather conditions but the return trip has been tentatively scheduled for spring.",

As recent as Aug 30th at 10:00A.M. I was starting to dig out shale to place a forest sign and was answered with the knocking and brush breaking in the big timber behind me, and bipedal footfalls. I would strike the rock and then the minute I would hesitate it would start the knocking of wood (not an echo) on shale and steel vs.wood on wood.",
