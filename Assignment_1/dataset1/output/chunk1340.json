            "Observed": "I haven't told many people about my experience because of alot of non-believers.The year was 1976, I was 15 years old. Snow was on the ground and a couple of friends and myself were snow sledding on my Dads farm. It was around 7:30 that night. We had a fire built at the bottom of the hill. We had just slid down the hill and were making our way back up the hill when we heard something making alot of noise and commotion to the right of us out beyond the light of the fire. We didn't stay around long enough to see what it was. I ran hard as I could to the house and told my parents about what we had heard. We went back to the hill the next day to see if we could find anything. When we saw the tracks in the snow we knew what was there at the bottom of the hill that night. The tracks were at least 18 inches long and 5 or 6 inches wide. No doubt in my mind what was there that night watching us.The tracks came from out of the woods that were near by and when it left, it went back in the woods the same way that it came. We didn't actually see the creature that night but we heard it and saw the tracks. That was almost 30 years ago and haven't seen or heard anything since.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness lived on a cattle farm with rolling pasture surrounded by mixed hardwoods and creeks.  When it snowed, he and his friends would pick a hill and sled down it. On this particular snowy evening, he and two of his friends built a fire and began sledding. At about 7:30 that evening they heard  noises coming from the tree line and tree branches breaking off. They could not see what was \"carrying on\" due to the darkness. However, whatever it was remained just outside of the light from the fire ring and watched them. He and his friends yelled to it but no response. They continued to hear tree branches snap along with movement. Needless to say the boys were alarmed and took off up the hill and back to the house. The next day they noticed the tracks, which measured 18 inches long and over 5 inches wide. They followed the tracks to the fence. A tree that stood 30 yards away from where the boys were gathered was completely stripped of branches and bark from about 8 to 10 feet off the ground. The branches and bark littered the ground.The witness also added that no cattle were in that particular pasture that evening. He said there is an abundance of deer and other wildlife in the area and the geography has not changed much since his encounter.",

The Road we took off of 191 North was long and unpaved. We camped for 3 days. There was cows grazing on the hills in the distance. My sister and I pitched a tent. My sister and I were annoyed by the constant mooing of the cows & the logging trucks the first night. The second night the cows settled down farely early around 12am and I noticed there was no other noises. In the early am there were no birds chirping or other little chipmunks running around. My sister was still sleeping and I was wide awake when I heard a whooping sound. Twice and very clear. I was trying to think of a bird that made that sound..but I couldn't. After I went on the BFRO website and listened to the whoop recording is when I realized that was exactly what I heard.",

From 191 north of Vernal she turned left onto FR 020 and set up camp about 5 miles in.The two whoops occured around 7am after a rather quiet night compared to the previous night when cattle and coyotes were heard.  The sound was loud enough for her to feel it was close to their camp but hard to judge the actual distance.After returning home she listened to alleged bigfoot vocalizations on this website.   The sound was very similar to the first two whoops from the 1974 California whoops and knocks clip.",
