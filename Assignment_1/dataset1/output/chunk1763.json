The area has springs and so the plant diversity is high and the wildflowers were at their peak.  Being a cloudy, cool day I kept an eye out for wildlife which would normaly bed down at midday in August, though I did not see anything other than various songbirds and raptors.",

Knocking and vocalizations have been reported.The witness points out that there are springs and abundant wildlife in the area. Through his own research he can only offer a sasquatch as a best possible source of the vocalizations. The sound seemed to come from a large animal unlike any vocalizations from known animals in this area.",

            "Observed": "Hello, I am writing for my mother as she is not very good with a laptop. They live in Valley City, Ohio. She saw something last night that has really scared her and didn't know who she could ask about it. Here's a little background. Over the past couple months they have heard deep growls off and on but have never seen anything. They live in the country with a river and woods across the roads both in front and behind the house. They never go outside at night unless they can help it because it just doesn't seem right out, sort of like they are being watched. Then this morning about 3 AM my mom was in the kitchen making coffee and looked out the large window on the side of the house and saw yellow eyes looking in at her. As she had the light on in the kitchen, she couldn't see the full body, but the window was open and she smelled a musty skunk smell. This was the only window that the blinds were not closed. Needless to say the coffee never got made. It scared her really bad. She went to the living room and sat in the dark until it got light outside. Then when it got light she went outside and said it smelled like a herd of skunks had been around. The window is fairly high on the side of the house and I am about 5' 2\" and can barely look in the bottom of it. We estimate that where the eyes where on the window it had to be close to seven foot tall. She said her iris flowers and some other plants were smashed down under the window and all the corn for her squirrels was missing. She couldn't see any tracks because of the plants and the ground was dry.",
