            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness over the phone on 4/3/2006 for about an hour. I believe this person to be credible. He is an avid outdoorsman and knows his wildlife. He recalled the encounter in detail even though it took place twenty-five years ago.The witness had camped out often by himself in this area of the Pine Barrens. On this day he was returning back to his campsite when he noticed something had just crossed the dirt road in front of him at a distance of about fifty feet. He did not see what it was but noticed the brush was moving where the animal had just entered from the opposite side of the road. He also heard what he described as deep thumping sounds.All the way back to his camp something was paralleling and pacing him. It was very sly and would stop when he stopped, as if trying not to be heard. Again he would hear the occasional thumping sounds.When he retired for the evening something began to approach the back of his tent. The animal started to scream at a very loud level. He had never heard anything like it before or since. Some low mumbling growls and chatter followed the scream.After hearing the animal approach the tent a second time, he became frightened and started to scream back at it: \"Get out of hear, go away, leave me alone\". Immediately after screaming, the animal retreated. The witness stayed up the entire night listening intently but never heard the animal again. He never saw what was making the noises. The next morning he packed up his gear and left the area.He has been back to the area since then and has come across human-like tracks in the mud. He estimated the tracks at about ten inches long and six inches wide. The area has become heavily used since the time of this incident. He has not had another encounter since then.",
