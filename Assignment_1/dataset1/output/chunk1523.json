One was very loud and appeared to be very near the house.  The second was about two houses away and was not as loud.  They appeared to be calling to each other three or four times.  The calls were very loud and deep.--When the witness went outside to look around, the sheep didn't seem upset or nervous.--The second set of calls occurred at around 4:15, but it was only a single individual this time.--The area where this occurred is flat, wooded, and rural.--Witness had not heard anything like that before or since in that location.--The witness also noted that she spoke to the NH Dept. of Wildlife Management to ask them what animal it could have been, but they didn't know.",
