The sounds were very clear...we had never heard this \"whooping\" sound before.  My Dad, who is 75 years old grew up in this area and has never heard these sounds.  He has hunted in this area his whole life and is very familiar with the local wildlife.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to this witness by phone. Coincidently, we have a family connection to this witness. The witness was very apprehensive talking about this incident as she did not believe in Sasquatch at the time. The family was together because of the loss of a family member. They were on the back patio of the house. The whoops they heard came from an area south of them in a creek bottom. She stated there were seven or eight whoops then the sound of a cow in distress. There is a pasture across the creek where a farmer keeps cows and some horses. One of the family members later did some computer research on the sounds and found files of Bigfoot calls. Some of these matched exactly what they had heard.She described the 'whoop' as distinctive and began low and ended on a higher note. I found this witness to be credible with no indication of being deceptive. I am personally familiar with this area and it is within a few miles of the Arkansas River and Kaw Lake. I have received information on other incidents in this area in the past.",
