With that comparison she said they were of greater length than sixteen inches.- She was also impressed with the distance between each footprint and did not think a human could step that far between each step.

            "Follow-Up Report": "During the phone interview, the witness accurately recalled the aspects of the incident, although it occurred over ten years ago.  She reiterated the feeling she had of being \"blessed to have seen such a thing\".  At approximately 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM, while her partner was down by the creek, the witness, standing on the gravel road, witnessed a large bipedal animal cross the road approximately 200-300 feet from her.  She was \"astonished\" upon seeing it.  She claims that the animal \"paused and looked at me\".  It then continued across the road (towards the creek) at a \"nice little walk\" and was lost from sight by the thick forest surrounding the area.  The witness stated that the sighting lasted approximately 80 seconds.  The witness describes the general color of the animal only as \"covered in dark hair\" and that it seemed quite tall.  Her \"astonishment\" at the sighting struck her so significantly that she did not have the wherewithal to take notice of the particular details of the animal.  The witness was articulate during the interview and spoke sincerely of the experience without any interest in self gain, notoriety or benefit.  Although her description lacked particular detail, I believe the witness to be credible. Note:  The witness did report several instances where she and her partner noticed strong and foul odors emanating from the nearby forest throughout the time period they spent in that area.  She also claimed to have heard unusual screams at night \"a couple times\" in the same area.  And there were times where she hiked that she felt as if she were being watched.  ",
