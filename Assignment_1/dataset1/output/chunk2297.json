            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking to the witness on the telephone, this outdoorsman added the following information.  While out hunting on the back side of his farm, he found a skull and small bones under some leaves beside a log.  He states that he has never seen this kind of skull before although he is familiar with many types of skulls including deer, possum, raccoon and coyote.  He is sending a jawbone out for DNA analysis to a nationally known scientist in the Bigfoot community.  Initial review of the photos he supplied shows indications of a domestic dog skull (in my opinion and of the opinion of a colleague who works in a veterinary clinic).   With that being said, the witness had three other instances on his farm worth noting.The first instance was that while out hunting for coyote last winter, a friend was hit in the face with a rock three inches in size.  This incident happened while hunting with red lights and high powered rifles at 2:30 am on the back side of the farm within 150 yards of where he found the skull.  Immediately upon getting hit underneath the eye, the teenagers heard something running away in the forest, loudly crashing sticks and leaves as it fled.  I asked him if it could have been another teenager pulling a prank and he said that there are just a few teenagers in the area and they wouldn\u0092t venture out into the woods knowing that there were people out hunting with high powered rifles.   A couple of days later, a he and a friend were out bow hunting for deer in the same general area.  It was early morning around a quarter to six with a full moon.  They noticed a dark figure walking along the fence line.  His friend said, \u0093Hey that is your cousin xxxx.\u0094  His cousin is pretty tall, so the witness whistled a greeting.  The figure stopped dead in its tracks, grunted and immediately took off into the woods.  They could hear it crashing along as it went deeper into the woods.  The witness got the impression that the figure was surprised and did not ever get a sense of what direction his whistling came from.  The figure was broad, tall and had the odor of a wet dog as it walked along the fence.  As it was running away, the witness stated that the odor turned from a noticeable odor to a stench that was overpowering.Finally, the witness stated that he and a friend were riding ATV\u0092s on the back side of the farm in August of this year.  Just after full dark around 10pm, they heard a big whoop noise come up the holler.  He said that he estimated that it was from a \u0093good ways\u0094 away, but it was fairly loud.When asked why he decided to report all of this, the witness stated that it was due to finding the skull.  He really thinks that it is something significant and is sending it out for DNA analysis.  While the skull may or may not be of any research value, the other incidents are interesting and I would have to classify them all together as B encounters.If there are any updates to report regarding the skull I will add them to this report.
