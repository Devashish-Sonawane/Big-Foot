            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness on 15 January 2006. He was 25 years old when the sighting occurred.His job was teaching survival skills to 10-12 year old kids near the top of Spruce Knob. Groups were up to 40 youngsters. He never saw anything directly. Something generated noises running away which sounded bipedal and very large. It was after the men yelled in the direction of what was inside the woods. On some evenings sticks were thrown at the men. He estimated that the closest approach was about 20 feet from the campfire ring, just inside tree line. Incidents happened at night, between 2200-midnight. Something out of the ordinary happened 10 times over a 30-day period.His tent is a Yurt, a round structure 15 feet across the center going to a point about 10 feet high. One night, it sounded like someone was climbing on his Yurt in the middle of the night. Another time he was awakened by what sounded like someone slowly pushing the side of the dwelling. It then ran its hands downward along the sides. Wood knocking occurred on evenings when the camp was approached. They could hear loud noises at a distance, which sounded like unknown calls. ",
