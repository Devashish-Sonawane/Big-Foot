When i pulled in i saw a tree stump that wasn't there before so i moved the car to put it in my headlights when i did the stump stood up and ran off on two legs. Let me tell you this creature has the best camo that ive ever seen. If he were to stand by a tree you wouldn't know he was there. When he ran he took long graceful strides as if he only weighed only ounces. When the light hit he didn't move at first but then he realized we saw him. He seems to sit on upper portions of open land surounded by dense under brush.",
