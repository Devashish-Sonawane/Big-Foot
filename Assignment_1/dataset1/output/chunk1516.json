            "Observed": "It was back in 1987 in the summer.  Myself and two friends went back to an old swimming hole to hang out for the day - Krofford Hole on the Gauley River to be exact.  After a few hours of fishing and swimming we all were laying out on a big rock beside the water.  During that time our dogs were playing around making alot of noise.  After awhile I noticed it got really quiet.  I sat up and started looking around. Across the river directly from us was a small clearing beside the water. A large 2 legged animal, dark brown in color, stood there like it was looking back at us.  The dogs just stood there staring over at it not making a sound or a move.  After about 2 minutes it turned and went up over the river bank. We could hear it moving up the hillside unti it was gone.  The next day we went back to the other side where it was standing.  I estimated by tree limbs over us it had to be at least 7 feet tall.  I'll never forget the silence of the woods that day.  Nor will I ever forget how it seemed to just stand there looking back.  My two buddies never wanted it to be known what we saw that day.  But I saw the other sighting report from near the same area.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have had several informative conversations with the witness. As a law enforcement officer, both at the time of the sighting, and now, he is factual and methodical in his memory and reporting of the incident. At the time of the event, he was a deputy sheriff in Lafayette county, Mo. Location of event was in Dover Mo., which is 60 miles east of Kansas City Mo. To this day, he is still in law enforcement.He had left his girlfriends home at around 3AM. As he approached the first \"S\" curve, he saw a \"creature of some type\" in the middle of the road. It was down on all fours with \"yellow glowing eyes\". The yellow glowing eyes were just that: glowing. He felt that the hair was reflecting off his headlights and gave it a \"sparkling\" effect. After it moved to the side of the road it stood up. He slowed way down. It was facing the side of his car with a full frontal view. This was when he determined it was a male. As he passed it, it cocked it's head slightly to the left while looking at him.Physical characteristics are as follows: Long dirty/matted hair 8-10 inches long with a mixture of grey and white, with some black as well. Clearly saw developed pectoral muscles. The hair was sparse on the chest and shoulder area and the skin was lighter, not tanned. At least 8 feet tall and in the 500 lb. range. It towered well above his Ford Escort. Massive broad shoulders and very long fingers hanging below the knees. When asked about the \"glowing eyes\" after it stood up, he stated that there was so much long matted hair that covered the face, that the eyes and face were completely hidden which gave him no facial features at all. Overall assessment of the creature was an \"unknown giant ape\" with a \"massive body builder physique\". It was not a bear, or any other known animal native to North America. He is adamant as to what he saw. And he has been an excellent observational witness.I will mention the \u0093Other Stories\u0094 and other anecdotal stories he told me, as they do give a back story to the general belief in that area that there is \u0093something going on there\u0094 in that part of Missouri. As an investigator, I have been to this area several times. Baltimore Bend Conservation area (1202 acres) has had several unconfirmed (not officially reported to BFRO) sightings and other activity. As he and I were finishing our phone interview, his mother overheard our conversation and grabbed the phone and confirmed his story. She also confirmed the story of a \u0093hairy wild man\u0094 that was rumored to live in an abandoned cave near the power plant in Lexington. I also investigated a report (reported to BFRO) of 2 fishermen harassed by a \u0093Sasquatch\u0094 during a night time fishing trip on the Missouri River outside of Napolean Mo, just a few miles west of Lexington. The other \u0093anecdotal\u0094 events reported were 2 sightings by his cousin at Baltimore Bend Conservation Area, calves missing from the cattle ranch when it was in operation. There were many reports of an abandoned cave (coal mine) that had \u0093something screaming at you\u0094 if you tried to enter the cave. The old farmer that lived there still lives there and we are trying to get permission to enter the property as of this writing. I mention these peripheral events, as it speaks to the \u0093common knowledge\u0094 of residents of the rural area that there have been things going on for many years. Several generations of families there all say the same thing.",
