            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witnesses by phone and found them to be credible.  The following can be added to this report.  The husband estimates that the snow pack that day was between eighteen to twenty four inches deep. He noticed the animal was walking bipedally. It was uniformly dark, except for the head area that was lighter.  After circling the van to check the area out, he proceeded into the woods about forty yards.  He states that they saw the animal in the woods at a distance of more than fifty yards.  The woods are somewhat open, and not dense.  They marked the distance because of a fallen tree.  The snow acted as a contrast to the woods at that time.  I spoke to the wife about this incident and the following can added.  She was the driver of the vehicle and after seeing the animal, backed up, then stopped when her husband noticed the animal in the woods.  She describes it as very large, black in color, she also noticed a leg as it moved, its arm, back and back of the head.  She did not notice a neck, she watched it as it took two steps and did not see it anymore.  This lasted about ten seconds.  She then finished pulling around the bend, she stopped the vehicle and waited as her husband went into the woods.  She only noticed silence at this point.  The husband made a whoop at this time and received two replies, wood knocks and then a growl.  Everyone in the van heard the vocalizations and knocks, as the windows were down.  They went back to the original spot, she did a whoop and did not receive a reply.  No bird or animal noises were noted at this time.  They returned the next day to the sighting location, no smell was noticed.  They were better dressed to go into the woods.  They brought a friend with them and he accompanied her husband further into the woods, the wife stayed in the vehicle during this foray.  The terrain to get back to the woods was difficult because of the snow.  Snowmobile tracks, human and other animals prints were noted.  At this point he was doubting the experience until he and his friend found prints that he was not expecting.  They took only pictures of one print. The prints that they came across were single file, they are twenty two inches in length.  This was approximately thirty yards from Cowles creek.  Nothing else was noticed at this time.I spoke to the gentleman who was with the couple when they went back to the location.  I found him credible.  He states that he has never seen tracks like this and that they were not snow shoes.  He also stated that they had toes.  He found a couple of prints coming from the creek.  He lost the tracks before the bridge and not able to find any more.  This was approximately ten yards from the bridge.  All of the prints that he observed were consistent with the pictures, and that they were not double prints.  He estimated the width at the heel at about five inches.  They did a size comparison with this witness who is six foot three and weighs three hundred eighty pounds.  They said it was much tall and broader than him. They did not go farther into the woods because of a man walking his two dogs.  Possible print from area of sighting.  Same print which was measured.  It is twenty two inches.  This area has had sightings in the past, Cowles Creek heads to the south.  The state park is used as a day area.  A dead fish was noted on a road with its head missing on the second visit.  Several ponds and small lakes are nearby as well as farms.  ",
