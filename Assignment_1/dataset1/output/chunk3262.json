            "Observed": "Sunday night.  I came out of the house to smoke a cigarette; it was an exceptionally cloudless, cool evening.  As I entered the yard I was immediately aware of a loud din coming from the woods about 1/3 of a mile off.  The sound of barking dogs is not unusual and is often accompanied by wolves, but this night the barking/howling sounded frantic.  Above all of this noise was a loud wailing like nothing I had ever heard before.  The source of this wailing held its position for about two minutes and then proceeded to move northeast around the lake covering a long distance in a very short time with great disturbance to the underbrush followed by a violent crushing of ice which seemed to indicate that whatever it was tried to cross a part of the frozen lake.  Each cry was quiet powerful and the duration I would estimate at about 15 seconds.  After changing positions the sound did not die out but simply stopped at the edge of the lake.  Immediately the dogs stopped barking and the wolves howling.  Dead silence.  A few minutes later the woods erupted in a cacophony of barking, howling and now birds (loons and owls)!  The wailing did not start up again but you could feel that it's presence was still there.  Afterwards, as the days went by, I tried to discredit what I'd heard but the sound was so strange and awesome that I don't think I could be convinced that what I heard was not unique.  It was not a dog, wolf, bear, coyote, deer, bird, rabbit, llama, or wild cat.",

            "Observed": "I was in rural Idaho, just north of a small town called Priest River. My friend and I go up to his ranch every year or so and just live there for a month. He has a dog that we bring along and like every other dog, he has the occasional need to relieve himself. So it was nighttime and it was my turn to take the dog out so I picked up an old Ruger 10-22 and brought the dog out for him to urinate. I was waiting outside when I saw a dark figure just beyond the tree line. It was massive, easily twice my height, and it just stood there, watching me. I would have taken a shot with my rifle but a tiny .22lr round wouldn't do anything to a creature that size. I just stood there looking back at it, when suddenly it broke out into a stride along the length of the tree line and it silently disappeared into the night. I was frozen in place until the dog tugged on the leash, beckoning me inside. I quickly gathered myself and rushed in through the door. I never saw clearly what was lurking in the darkness but I'm sure that it was Bigfoot.",
