            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness and found him to be credible. His reason for reporting on the Horicon Marsh area was  to create awareness for the BFRO.He said that when he and a friend had their experience in the marsh, they felt an overwhelming \"Fight or Flight\" response. The movement they heard was \" very heavy\", and they fled.He also elaborated on the deer story, saying it was told to him by a local public figure. When the DNR was platting the marsh, they found caves and 15 - 20 gutted deer carcasses were stacked up outside of them. Telling me there have been weird happenings in the area for 30 - 40 years.The Marsh is both a national and state protected wildlife area, approx 15 miles North/South and 5-7 miles East/West. Horicon Marsh is one of the largest freshwater marshes in the US. Fed by the Rock River which flows through the refuge, following a course through southern Wisconsin and eventually ending in the Mississippi River in Illinois. \"Horicon\" is a Mohican word for pure, clean water.",
