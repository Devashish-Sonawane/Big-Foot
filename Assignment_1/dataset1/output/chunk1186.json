            "Observed": "I can vividly remember the event. We lived on Stroup Road, which was about 10 miles west of Festus Mo.  It was in the winter and there was several inches of snow on the gound.  Me and my younger brother was riding our 4-wheerler on our property and was looking ahead up the trail and saw a large creature moving through some pine trees up at the end of the trail.  Even though I was about 13 at the time, I had a couple years of deer hunting and had seen a black bear before, the size of the animal or creature I had saw difenatly was not either of the two.  It was dark colored and and appeard to be at least 6 or 7 feet tall.  I couldn't make out any real features but it scared the heck out of me and my brother.  I turned around and hauled butt out of there.  I drove through a small creek and up a steep hill to get back to our house, was so scared that I left the 4-wheeler running. I was just happy that the 4-wheeler made it up the hill. Just talking about this brings goose bumps on my legs and arms.  I can remember this like it was yesterday.  People that I have told this to chuckle at the story, but they weren't there.",
