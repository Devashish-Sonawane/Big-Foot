            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness at length about his 2011 sighting and about his four year old daughter\u0092s experience in 2006. Normally the BFRO will not publish a sighting report from a witness as young as the daughter was. But because the two sightings are from the same family and in close proximity the daughter's sighting has been retained in this report.His daughter told him that she saw two monkeys at the edge of his field as she was riding in her mother\u0092s car. One monkey was larger than him (he is 6\u00924\u0094) and the other one was bigger than a regular monkey but smaller than a man.   The larger one was waving at her. This is notable because of a local legend in Anderson County about a monster named \u0093Howdy\u0094. People speak of seeing a large ape-like being in certain parts of the county and that this animal is known to wave at people (hence the name, Howdy). The witness\u0092 daughter, being four years old was not aware of that legend.In November 2011, during the modern gun season for deer, the witness watched what he determined to be two sasquatch jog hurriedly by his tree stand, coming within 25 yards of his position. The creatures kept looking behind them as they moved out of the wood line, across a corner of the field by the pond and into the next wood line. The creatures moved swiftly in unison, going side by side in a hurry. He felt that they were worried about something behind them because they were continuously looking back as they moved. Once the creatures went out of sight into the second wood line, he scanned the forest with the scope of his .270 rifle. He saw movement, but could no longer see them clearly. The creatures did not emit an odor and they moved in complete silence.One was black with brown highlights in the hair and the other was dirty blond. The witness stated that he was impressed by the length of their arms, which easily reached to their knees. The face on the black one was not fur covered but had lighter hair around its eyes, nose and mouth. The face on the blond one was not fur covered but he noted that it was darker in coloration than its coat. The creatures did not seem aggressive in their behavior. Although he was scared and armed, he did not feel threatened by them. As a matter of fact, he was curiously waiting to see what would pop out of the woods next in pursuit of the two creatures. The witness waited ten minutes, and then walked to his house to gather his thoughts and digest what he had just seen. Later, he went out to the stand to look for sign. He thought he might find a track around his pond, but the grass was too tall to discern any impressions.  The witness has since gone hunting in that stand with the expectation of seeing them again, to no avail. He also stated that he usually sees a lot of deer and harvests at least one nice buck every year. This year, he never saw a single deer on his property. Earlier in the day, while listening for gun shots, the witness heard three single wood knocks spread out over a few hours. The witness seemed sincere and credible. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness on Saturday September 27th, 2014. He stated that he heard the most blood curdling howls you have ever heard, including one the prior evening of September 26th.  The witness hears the howls late at night when he is visiting his friend's residence. The chain of events started a month and a half ago, when his friend was awakened in the middle of the night by a bone chilling scream.  The howls have been occurring every two or three nights according to the witness.  He has also noticed that when the howls are close by there is a musky dog scent close by.Last year, the witness and a friend drove out to Meadow\u0092s Grove Road where it dead ends at a grave yard.  Driving back on the road, they saw something black with an estimated height of 7 to 8 feet.  As the car approached, they saw it run on two legs down to the woods.  They could hear it crashing through the brush.  The witness verified the height by comparing it to a tree it was standing beside and coming up with an estimate.Since this is still an active occurrence, I encouraged the witness to use his digital recorder in an attempt to capture the howls.",
