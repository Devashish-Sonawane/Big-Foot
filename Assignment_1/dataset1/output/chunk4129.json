            "Observed.1  ": "\tRegardless of the veracity of all sightings, Grumley has found unusual footprints three times. The first footprints were found 90 miles from Lancaster and were huge as photographs Grumley took indicated.  Two weeks ago past 200th Street East, Grumley found some prints that were unusual and vague in an old reservoir.  Now he has found prints, 16 inches long, 7 1/4 inches across the toes and 5 1/4 inches across the heal.  The impressions of the feet were one inch deep. Indicating a rather heavily built frame had made them.  The fact that the prints were 6 1/2 feet apart also indicates a tall whatchamacallit.  \tGrumley said that while he and his crew were making a methodical 56-mile radius search for the mysterious interloper several cars of teenagers armed with firearms had to be turned back from the area. Smith and Cliff Colton were the first who came across the prints about 3:30 am last Saturday where they saw something moving on the side of the hills near one of their outposts. Others accompanying them were Fred and Liman Adams of Lancaster and Stan Luzak and Ed Thompson of Palmdale into the Black Buttes country where the armed teenagers reported that they had seen something but could not give a description. On Sunday morning several members of the group heard a thumping noise and then looked up to a ridge about 400 to 500 ft. away and saw what appeared to be silhouette of a large man. A closer check of the area ended with negative results.  \tDale Howard of Dale's Auto Clinic at 44434 90th St. East Lancaster, has a different slant on the whole thing.  Dale is just the opposite of verbose.  He isn't saying much until he's sure.  People laugh he says. And he is right.  They laugh sometimes at Grumely, but he considers it all part of the job of trying to be the first human being trying to track down and capture a Bigfoot creature.  Howard said, that he and his wife Bonnie heard something several days ago when he went out side, but he is not saying just what it was.  Neither is Henry Hovorka, a 25 year- old mechanic who works for Howard.  It just stood there, \"he says of the thing.\"  Both men seem of a serious nature and would be just as happy if there was nothing around or if they hadn't seen anything to start them thinking about making a few searches on their own.  All Hovorka would say was that \"\u0085 it seemed unnatural in size.\"  He saw it near 90th St. East.  Note: The Girl and the Marines saw it, Bigfoot, or what ever near 100th St. and 110th St. respectively. \"I saw something there and big, but I couldn't prove what I saw\". Hovorka said, so I'd rather not say much about it.  Those are about the same words echoed by Howard and his wife.  Howard said he took his flashlight in hand and went outside but returned to the safety of his home when his flashlight went dim.  Howard said he thinks something unusual exists out there and that possibly it could be just a large animal.  \"It would have to be a large animal to scare dogs.\"",
