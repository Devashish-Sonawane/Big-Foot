He has been hunting for over thirty years.When the encounter began he was surprised that the one set of eyes never turned away from watching him as the group left the area.  He felt that was certainly unlike deer or any other wildlife he was acquainted with. It was his impression that they were bipedal. He is also positive that the large object was thrown and had not fallen.  The vocalizations that he heard on the animals' departure he described as sounding angry, disturbed, mumbling and guttural.  The bedding area that he found was not typical of deer.  He said the smell was kind of skunky or musty.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the gentleman, a retired nurse on the phone.  He went camping at Jumping Creek Campground on Memorial Day weekend 2010.  The witness stated that his mother and father also had an encounter in the the campground in the 70\u0092s, and his uncle later in the 80\u0092s. On Saturday morning he hiked out to a remote spot on Lamb Creek with his fishing pole. As he got near the creek he noticed a foul odor.  He assumed the decay-like smell was just winter-kill nearby. He didn\u0092t notice a dead animal, but the smell stayed constant as he settled down on the creek bed and began fishing.  He noticed the creek was running high, about double the size it usually was, and a beaver dam was about 30 feet from where he was sitting.  After a while he heard something splashing in the water near the dam. He turned his head and saw a sasquatch about 30 feet away squatting across the creek by the dam, washing something in the water.  She was diagonally across from him. The witness was sitting behind a bush and assumed the squatch did not see him until he stood up and screamed.  He was able to watch it for approximately 10 seconds before he stood up. Once he screamed the squatch stood up, turned her head toward the dam, and gave a deep sounding noise that sounded like, \u0093Uhh.\u0094  She then turned around quickly and \u0093glided\u0094 away. The witness thinks she had been either washing her hands or berries in the water. He described the sasquatch as a female; she had hairy sagging breasts. She was brown with reddish highlights throughout. When she stood up, she was about 7 feet tall and her coloring blended in very well with the Red Willows nearby. Her hair was very matted, coarse, tangled and 6-7 inches long.Her head seemed to be more conical than round and she had a brow ridge and strong jaw line. The witness said when she looked at him her eyes were an unusual greenish-brown color.  Her nose was wide like a gorilla, but shaped liked a human. There was no hair on her cheeks. He did not see the ears. Her lips were flat and black. Her torso was thick and muscular. The witness noticed that she had hair on the back of her hands. The witness was very frightened and got back to camp as quickly as he could. He never left the camp the rest of the weekend. The witness is adamant that she turned her head AWAY from him when she vocalized.  I think if she had vocalized in surprised, she would have faced him, therefore it is possible she was warning a family member that the witness was nearby.  It should also be noted that no beavers were seen, as the squatch looked towards the dam when vocalizing.The area is pristine sasquatch habitat.
