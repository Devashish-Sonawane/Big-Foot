He heard the wood knock on his approach to his deer stand.  - He heard tree breaks and knocks for several minutes until he pinpointed the location.-  The witness viewed the creature in a squatted position through his rifle scope.- The creature stood-up to a height of about 8 feet, and then smelled the air.  The witness stood-up in his climber to get a better look and the creature saw him and ran off on two legs.  The gait was forward leaning, pushing foliage out of its way as it ran.-  The hair color was black and the witness could not make out facial features except that the face appeared flat, no snout, and he noticed the skin color was greyish.  The hair on its head appeared to have green moss tangled in it.-  The witness, in disbelief, climbed down and went to the spot and found an 18 inch track that was as wide as both of his feet together.  The track had five toes.  -  While examining the track the witness heard two whoops from one side and a tree knock.  Immediately followed by two more whoops from the other side of his position.  Now realizing there were at least two creatures, the witness left the area post-haste.",

The time was 11:00 pm and everyone was asleep or at least in their cabins.  It took me 3 minutes to walk to the showers and on the way I didn't notice anything unusual.  After my shower I stepped outside at approximately 11:25 to walk around to the other side of the building.  At this point I recall the sounds of the forest being stilled or a little subdued.  I also noticed that there were no sounds of the junior staff coming from the bunk house or pool as was usual that time of night, but it didn't make much of an impression on me as I entered the other side of the building and grabbed my laundry basket.",

During this time the Ranch was empty except for him and a friend who had come to visit him and all was blanketed under snow.  He told me that the one evening when his friend visited him they went out and were hiding from each other and kidding around when he heard a frightning sound coming from the woods behind him that sounded exactly as I had described what I had heard.  Thinking it was his friend he called to him and his friend stepped out of the bushes infront of him with a frightened look on his face saying it wasn't him.  Also their are many strange stories of things being disturbed and such during the winter months but they may have been concocted for scaring the campers.",
