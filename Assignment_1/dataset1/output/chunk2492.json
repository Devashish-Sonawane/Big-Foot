            "Observed": "I was about ten or eleven years old. I was traveling with my mom and younger brother in a car on a rural road near Rocky Mount, N.C. in 1979. It was at night. We spotted a tall hairy figure crossing the road ahead of us. It was close enough to see in the headlights. (I am remembering all of this through a child's eyes but my mom remembers the same accounts). We slowed down, almost to a complete stop because the figure stopped right in the middle of the road. It turned and looked at us with it's body still facing in the direction it was originally headed. It was extremely tall, had hair all over it's body and it's arms were really long. It suddenly ran with super fast speed and jumped the ditch and was gone. It was like nother I had ever seen before or have seen since. I have been an avid outdoorsman...I hunt and fish and camp all over NC, SC & VA. I have seen bears in their natural invironments. I have seen them stand to look at me and then run away, but they always go back down to all fours to do that. I am convinced that what I saw as a child was in fact, a Bigfoot or sasquatch.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, DS, and she seemed pleased to be able to share her encounter with me. She stressed to me that the encounter happened while she was young, and couldn\u0092t recall fine details, but that the incident itself it is etched in her memory. - While riding with her mother and younger brother at night, DS saw an upright, hair-covered creature standing in the middle of the road.- It took place in a wooded, rural area that has a large population of deer. The area is now more developed and is not as rural as it was in 1979.- When she and her mother saw the creature standing in the road, they rolled to a complete stop. The creature was approximately 40-50 yards ahead, illuminated by their car\u0092s headlights. The younger brother has no recollection of the event.- After they came to a stop, the creature, seen at a side angle and standing still, then turned towards them. After a second or so, it turned back towards the woods and took 2-3 fast strides, stepped over a 6-8 ft ditch, and disappeared into the woods. The whole encounter happened in less than 5 seconds.- It seemed to have a gait like a human, only faster and with a much longer stride. DS stated that no human could match the length of the stride it was taking. She described it as taking \"tremendous steps\". \"No human could have crossed that ditch in one leap without a good, running start. It did it with just a couple of steps.\"- The creature stayed upright during the entire encounter. DS stated that it was around 7 ft tall.- DS stated that the creature had no visible ears, and no visible neck. She stated that it had long legs, arms that reached below the knees, and that its head was \"big\". DS recalled that the eyes were big and dark. - DS stated that the creature she saw was covered in dark brown hair. \"I don\u0092t remember if the hair moved when it was walking. But it was covered with hair. I remember that.\"- \"It was really big\", DS recalled. \"And it wasn\u0092t a bear. I know what a bear looks like. This was no bear.\"- When asked if the car windows were down, DS stated that she couldn\u0092t remember, but she didn't recall any unusual sounds or odors during the incident. - After the incident, when they got home, they told DS\u0092s father about the encounter. He didn\u0092t believe them. 20 years later, DS finally told her aunt about the encounter. Her aunt believed her because her son (DS\u0092s cousin) had a similar encounter in the same area, 20 years later.I found DS to be forthright and sincere in her description of what happened to her and her mother in 1979. I believe that she was telling the truth and that what she and her mother witnessed was a bigfoot.",

It was about 5:00 am and we were just crawling into our hunting blind.  We both heard this load scream.  It sounded just like some of the high pitched sounds made on finding bigfoot.  Neither one of us had ever heard anything like it before or after the incident.  It scared the heck out of the both of us.  We loaded our shotguns as quickly as we could.",

His description of the scream was more like the high pitched \"woman being murdered\" scream as we have come to call it.  And, as they were crawling into the blind, there was a huge \"crash\" which to the witness, sounded like a tree falling or being thrown. It was very loud, and it was at this point they began \"shoving shells in their guns as fast as they could get them in\". The number of turkeys roosting was estimated to be 50-100 as they were estimated on the scouting trip, yet when they went back the roosting area was void of turkeys. As he mentioned, it was highly unusual for that time of year. The reason he waited so long to report it was that he was unsure as to what he heard, and only came forward due to the TV show and website with a variety of sounds that matched what he and his friends heard. The report he mentioned, near Pratt, Kansas, was my published report #35828, and he is 30-40 miles from that location. There is a lot of activity in and around Rice county.",
