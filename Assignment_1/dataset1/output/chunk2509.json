            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone, who was glad to discuss his experience.  The vocalization was heard around 2 AM in late December, 1977.  When it was heard, it woke everyone in the house up.  It sounded as if it was right next to the house, like a freight-train sounding its horn as it sped by your bedroom window.   It was also compared to a 'masculine, woman-like scream', or a 'big guy with a falsetto and a deep resonance'.  It lasted about 5 seconds, and trailed off into a steady, consistent growl/howl.  The Ohio howl is similar, but not exact, to what was heard.   According to the witness, it could not compare to any known animal sounds.The vocalization was heard from a residential area.  There is a small forested area nearby, close to a VA hospital, and a larger forested area on the other side of Interstate 57.   The area is still similar to what it was back in 1977, but with a significant increase in population. It is interesting to note that the residents of the area would leave their garbage and waste out in the alley, where it would sit for days before being collected.  ",
