            "Observed": "I was in the woods one morning when I heard a very distinct noise - or noises. It started out with a rustling of leaves that sounded more like something had found a small tree and was just shaking it - that went on for a few seconds. Then we heard a long, low howl followed by growls, grunts, snorts, and higher-pitched squeals. The sequence of noises then repeated itself, starting with the rustling. It was very loud.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone about his experience.  He was hiking around this forested area with a female friend - this is an area he has routinely gone to throughout the years, having grown up nearby.  The following details can be added:-they were in the area for about 5 minutes before the tree shaking and vocalizations started-the low-pitched rumbling growl increased in pitch over an 8-10 second span, and the second set of vocalizations was exactly like the first-the two 'displays' were a couple minutes apartThe witness described this incident as a 'threat display', and that is how he felt after hearing the vocalizations and seeing the tree shaking occur.  They left within minutes of the second vocalizations, without seeing the creature that was causing this. There is a creek running through this patch of woods, with farmland and forest throughout the area.  There are also many 'dark, thick' patches of trees and undergrowth in the forest where this occurred. Tree shaking has been reported before in possible sasquatch encounters.  This particular situation, what the witness described as a 'threat display', could have been just that; the creature wanted them out of the area, and did the tree shaking and vocalizations to achieve this.Below is an aerial image of the location - note the creek running through the area:",
