            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness at length by phone, and without prompting he recounted the events as he submitted them.  He seemed to be a well spoken, educated person and was very friendly and pleased to talk about his experience to someone.  The site is in King County, even though it was initially reported to be in Pierce.  The Greenwater river is the dividing line.He says he used to be a hunter, but now mainly target shoots.  He also mentioned the area in question is an elk range.After he initially recounted events, I did get him to clarify a few details about the order of events, the sounds, and their nature.  He added that the first time he heard the sound was by his truck during his initial verbal description of events.1st Sound: Standing by truck.  Sounded like a giant woodpecker drumming fast.  Tapered off after about 3 seconds.Witness then walked up the trail 50-60 yards, began to feel uncomfortable.  He then encountered the smell, which he described as pungent like horse manure, but much more musky in character.Witness continued a bit further up the trail, when the sounds again occured.2nd Sound:  Same noise - about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away off to witness's left (west).3rd Sound:  Same noise - seconds after last sound, seemingly in response, ahead and slightly left, about 1/4 mile or less away - in the middle of the swampy area.  With this nearer sound the witness said he could feel the compression/concussion of the sound in his body.  The witness described his state as frightened at this point, but he continues up a bit further to a gully.  This is when the heavy running footsteps, and breaking brush ahead of him cut from left to right (west to east) across the trail ahead (and out of view) of the witness.  The witness said the ground was spongy/loamy and he could \"feel\" the footsteps' vibration through the soil.\"It seems like it wanted to cut me off,\" he said over the phone.As he headed down a different trail, again the running footsteps, and breaking brush moved across his path - now below him, and this time from east to west.Witness recalled that he could smell the pungent smell until he cut through the bush to rejoin his original path.When asked to describe the sound over the phone, witness put the phone down, and rapidly beat on his chest, and said it was like that only much deeper.  I asked him why he thought it was made by beating a chest.  He replied that it could have been something beating on a hollow log.Witness had mentioned a great number of deadfalls earlier in the conversation, when recounting the environment.On leaving the area in his vehicle witness saw a man camping along the road not far from the main highway, and he warned him that, \"there was something big up there.\"This investigator has visited the site a number of times, and has the following observations:1)  In April 2001 there was a considerable population of grouse drumming in the forest on either side of the path in question.  Some individuals do mistake this sound for out of the ordinary sounds.2)  The area if frequented by a great number of elk, and a heavily trodden elk trail is located between 50 - 150 feet of the path, running roughly parallel with the trail.3)  The investigator expected to find Skunk Cabbage in the wet areas near the trail, but NO skunk cabbage is present - indicating the musky odor did not come from this common plant.4)  The site also has considerable evidence of mountain lion, and deer.  The unnamed stream east of the trail hosts coho salmon.",
