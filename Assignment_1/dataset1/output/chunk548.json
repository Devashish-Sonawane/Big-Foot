            "Follow-Up Report": "After discussing this incident with the witness, I have the following to add:This sighting occurred around 6:30 p.m.  He was driving with a friend who also saw the creature.  He describes the creature as squatting down in a grassy area immediately adjacent to the road with its knees close to its armpits.  The head was down, and both arms were extended forward searching through the grass with hands as if looking for something.  It was not digging.  The hair was black, with no highlights.  His first impression was that it was a young person in a costume on the side of the road, but he ruled this out quickly since the skin and hair fit tightly to the body.  The creature did not turn to look at them, but rather kept searching through the grass.  The face was not seen.  The witness estimated it was the size of an average human male and maybe up to 225 pounds.  After seeing the creature he asked his friend if he had seen it, and his friend acknowledged he had.   They turned the car around to look again, but the creature had left the area.  They did not get out of the car to investigate the area. This witness is very credible and I think that he and his friend did see a sasquatch on the side of the road that evening.The Tennessee River is very close to this location.",
