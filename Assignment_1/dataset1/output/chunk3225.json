I was on my way to Chippewa Lake to pick up my sister in law, I was traveling South on River Styx Rd. between Route 18 and Route 162 when I noticed a deer crossing sign and thought I better slow down before a deer jumps out in front of me. Seconds later, I saw eyes just off the road reflecting from my headlights and I thought it would be a deer so I slowed down to a crawl so I would not hit it if it decided to cross the road. But as I got closer, I noticed that the eyes were to high off the ground to be a deer and when I took a closer look I saw a (7 or 8 ft.) tall man-like creature next to a big tree. He was noticeably hairy and had very long arms, like down to his knees. He looked right at me as I passed like he was waiting to cross the road. I could not believe what I had just saw and I could not bring myself to turn around for a second look. I never did report this to anyone except for friends and family, until my son showed me this sight and I read other people's stories.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness added that the alleged creature had very long arms and weighed well over 300 pounds. The overall length of the arms is what really stood out to the witness and convinced him that the animal in question was in no way a bear. As he approached, he noted the eye's were red in color. The total time of the incident was around 15 seconds in duration. It appeared to have a bony ridge (crest?) on the top of its head and dark brown in color. A few days after his sighting, a farmer had a sighting near Chippewa lake that was in the local area paper. Investigated by BFRO Ohio investigater Marc D",
