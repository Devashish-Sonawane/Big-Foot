            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness by phone and arranged to meet to talk about the encounter.The witness and I met to discuss the details of that morning in 1982. At the time of the encounter, the witness was in high school and working part-time at a local dairy farm.It was around 5 AM on a Sunday morning in March with a full moon out and he was going about the pre-milking routine of feeding the livestock.Located behind the barn was a small shed inside a fenced in area where the young heifers were kept. That morning the witness was carrying two 5 gallon buckets, one with silage, the other with grain. As he approached the gate, he found the heifers all bunched up in the corner by the gate, which is out of the ordinary. They would normally be lying over by the hay feed rack. He made his way through them and dumped the bucket of silage in the trough. A grunting noise caught his attention, it sounded like a person rising from being down in a crouching position for too long. He looked in the direction of the sound, towards the hay rack 75 feet away and saw a 7 to 8' tall, bipedal creature, coming to a standing position. They stood looking at each other for 5-10 seconds before the creature turned and started walking away into the darkness out of sight.There was a full moon that morning with a coating of frost on the ground. While the creature was facing him, the witness said that due to distance and available light, the creature was dark in color. He was unable to make out any facial features, but did say it had broad shoulders and an absence of a neck. When it turned and started walking, its footsteps made a crunching sound on the ground. He was looking at the side profile of the head expecting to see a snout so he could identify it as a bear, but the side view of the head showed a flat face. As it walked, the witness noted that its arms were long and its hands hung down by its knees. As the creature disappeared in to the darkness the witness heard a creaking of the 4' tall wire fence at the back side of the pen as the creature stepped over it.The witness went about finishing his chores. When the milking was done, he went back out to the hay rack to see if he could find any evidence of tracks or possible hair where it stepped over the fence. Unfortunately, nothing was found.",

            "Observed": "Hi, my name is Kevin, I'm 52 now. I went hunting with my dad in Dent County near what now is called Lake 117 east of Salem Missouri in Mark Twin National forest. I was approx. 1/4 mile from the old farmhouse up a tree with a view from 10 ft. off the ground approx. Anyhow I remember seeing a doe running by my stand looking scared and then I saw why. It was a tall black man running after it except that was not a black man chasing a deer naked, one went to my left and I could hear loud thrashing in the thick section of woods and I assumed it had caught the animal and was killing it. Astounded I could not believe what I had just seen and then it was when I turned to my right there he stood 20 ft from my tree and was standing there looking at me and I remember thinking who are these black men running naked thru the woods? but wait this was a very hairy being with a type of crest on its somewhat of an oddly shaped head, black hair but thinner in spots and when we made eye contact it growled very deeply. I was so frickin scared I could not understand what was going on, I have goose bumps and fear still to this day 40 years later. I don't like being ridiculed I have tears in my eyes now trying to write this to people that might understand this situation. Scardest I've ever been and in my life time I have had two guns pulled on me, sorry I'm wandering from my encounter. This being of the woods had black eyes and a light tan colored nose that was somewhat triangular looking to me, so this giant tall very strong looking being turned and started running over towards the thrashing sound but I couldn't believe how lucky I felt. Just a step or two and it could of yanked me right out of the tree I was in and soon as it was out of sight I believe I just jumped out of the tree I was in and started running up the logging road back to the farm house where my dad was. I remember stopping and turning around with my dads thirty thirty and I shot in the direction of it and yelling to leave me alone and on the rest of the way back to the farmhouse approx. 300 yds it was paralleling me in the thick woods making all kinds of rackit. I still get scared thinking of this I felt I was lucky that it didn't kill me i was around 11 or 12 and when I finally got back to the farm house my dad was there having a nip, if ya know what I'm saying, he could tell something was wrong with me, and i did my best to explain to him what was going on outside so he headed out. But the beast must have headed back to the deer kill 300 yds away. Umm I'm not sure if he ever truly believed me and that really upset me and I took his whiskey away from him and said now listen dad you have to believe me what I just saw. Well the owner of the farm arrived the next day and he believed me. I was so relieved he truly believed me and i could tell. He was a local doctor and told me he had seen giant footprints in the sand on his beach of his lake what now is this conservation lake he must have left them after he passed away. But I remember him being so interested in what had happened to me and truly believing me. Dang this brings fear and tears too me still the trying too understand, what the heck was going on around me in this deer stand. Never been that scared again, it was so hard to see this and understand that it was real so I've heard that it was one in a million chance of this happening. All I can say is how lucky i was that I wasn't on the menu that day so after analyzing this I truly believe that even though they are giant, inside they won't hurt you but will harass you to leave them alone and remember never look them in the eyes he will let out a very very deep growl and your legs will start shaking uncontrollably. I believe they just want to be left alone, still curious on how humans live. Think about it they could take you with out a problem, you have no chance at all, when I think back about this that is what I have interpreted I guess I would be famous if I had shot it but i didn't have that in me and still don't think i do. I appreciate what you BFRO guys and gals have done except if you would just stay longer in a area that one or more have been sighted that's how you will get your chance at some greater evidence. I wish I had never repressed this memory. Bothers me. Also I see in 2005 a guy had heard one only a couple of miles from where I had my encounter. I believe these animals are in small groups and travel nomadically thru out the thick woods and I guess they eat a lot of deer. I know they had caught one not too far maybe 30 are 40 yds from my stand in this thick woods. I could hear them but couldn't see what was going on. Listen just give me a call and I will tell ya what happened that day. I am ready to discuss this with you pros, dang you guys are so bold.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness on the phone. Story speaks for itself, and I will add data gleaned from our conversation. He was in a deer stand, and it was truly a \"stand\". A 2x2 ft plank for standing only. It was appx. 4-5 ft. off the ground. It was just after sunrise, about 6:30AM during hunting season. He was standing in the tree when a frightened deer came running by, its eyes bulging out, in a dead run, and he knew it was in fear and being chased. He saw the first creature, the \"naked black man\" coming from left to right after the deer. The deer ran into the brush, and he heard a struggle and saw a second \"hairy black man\" for a brief second, then the struggle stopped. He assumed the first creature chased the deer into the waiting arms of the second creature. The first creature then turned and walked back towards him. It looked right at him, face to face, no more than 15-20 ft. away. The creature was looking at him at eye level. He estimates the size of the creature at a minimum of 10 ft in height, and possibly more like 11 ft. The stand was 5 ft. off the the ground and he figures he was 5 ft. tall or a bit taller. Black hair.  Large black eyes, no whites, large triangular nose, and the skin color was a tan or brown color. The head seemed small for the size of the body, but had a crest with raised hair on the top. Creature was very well built, slender and powerful, not bulky and massive like some he has seen on TV. It stared at him for a good 10-15 seconds, then let out a bone rattling growl. The creature then walked off and at that point he jumped out of the stand and ran the opposite way. He looked around, and saw the hidden creature looking out from behind a tree in the brush. And the other creature that had looked him in the eye had turned around and was now walking back toward him. He fired a shot from his rifle over their head, not at them, and screamed \"leave me alone\". He turned and ran again and never looked back. He told his dad about the encounter and was dismissed at first. He told the owner of the land, who was a local doctor, and he told the witness he was a lucky boy to have had the experience. He was not so sure at the time. ",
