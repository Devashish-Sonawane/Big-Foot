            "Follow-Up Report": "I called this witness and we talked for 30 minutes about his experience.  The sighting happened in the fall of 1991.  The witness was 18 years old.  He and his friend skipped school to go fish the lakes on Weyerhaeuser land east of the town of Snoqualmie.  At that time, those roads were open all the time.  Today, they are gated.  While talking with the witness, I could hear the emotion in his voice as he recounted the event.He and his friend had finished fishing and were on their way back to town.  They were traveling down the J-line road and right where it intersected the Main-line, the road makes a bend to the right.  When they turned onto the Main-line road, they saw the sasquatch walking away from them on the right hand side of the road.  It was about 70 yards away.  They were both startled by the sight.  They stopped the truck for a few seconds, and watched in disbelief as the sasquatch walked rapidly away and around a bend to the right out of sight.  Before the sasquatch went out of view, it turned and looked at them.  In a few seconds, they drove on around the corner.  They saw the sasquatch was about 70 yards further down the road.  It turned to the left and crossed the road, disappearing into the heavy brush. Both young men were very upset.  The friend of the witness was the most frightened.  The witness said that his friend was terribly upset and disturbed by the incident for a long time.  He has since lost contact with his friend. The witness was able to provide good description of what he saw.  The first thing he noticed was the sheer massive size.  The build was bulky.   He said it was at least eight feet tall.  Its shoulders were four feet wide (he is in construction, and compared the size to the width of a sheet of plywood\u0085good comparison).  He said that the head was cone shaped, but not pointy.  It had no neck and he could see the trapezium muscles connecting the shoulders to the head when it turned to look back at them.  The head was large, and the face was black skinned.  The mouth and lower jaw area was between 10-12 inches wide.  Its face was more round shaped than oval. The upper legs were thick, and then thin below the knee. The bottoms of the feet he said were of particular note because they were light tan colored, in contrast to the rest of the creature.  The arms were long, and the hands extended almost to the knees.  The hands were black skinned.  Its hair was 3-4 inches long.  It was dark brown with some reddish tint.  He was not able to get a look at its eyes or nose due to the distance.I asked him how it walked.  He said that it walked fast, but did not run.  It walked with knees that were always bent.  It walked very smoothly.  Its posture was slightly bent forward. This man, who is 36 now, lives in Montana.  He is a life-long outdoorsman who has harvested deer, elk, and bear.  He would not mistake a bear for this creature.  His knowledge of the wildlife makes his observation reliable.There is no doubt in my mind that this person and his friend saw a sasquatch.  The description is detailed and accurate.  The location is in typical sasquatch habitat.  There is thick forest of varying age, ponds, lakes, and streams in this location.  It is an ideal location, and I wish that we had access to the area.  ",
