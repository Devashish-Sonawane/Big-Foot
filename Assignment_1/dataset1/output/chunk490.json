            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness about his experience in 2007. On this morning 3\" of fresh snow had fallen, ending around 4 AM. He was deer hunting with a bow, walking 300 yards of a two-track fire lane road, on the edge of the Chequamegon Nicolet National Forest. Looking for a place to place his tree stand, he saw a trail of footprints in the snow and followed them for 70 yards, until they went into a thicket. He distinctly saw toe prints in the tracks, and said they were 1.5 \" longer, and 2 \" wider than his size 13 boot track. The stride space between tracks was 1.5 times longer than his stride and he is over 6' tall, 230 lbs. A lifelong hunter, he knows the difference between bear, deer, elk, etc. tracks in the woods. He described the tracks he saw as looking like  \"bare feet prints\" in the fresh snow.  he had no phone for pictures, as it was 2007, and he did not have camera capability.Upon sitting in his tree stand, he heard knocks, breaking branches, sticks cracking, low growling sounds, huffs and moans. These came from a spot 100 yards from him, over the course of an hour. The hair stood up on his neck, and nervous, he went for his car and left.",
