We were getting ready to light one off when we all heard a loud scream.  It was very early in the morning, probably around 1:00 a.m., and it was loud enough and so uot of place that it made all of us pause.  It sounded identical to the Klamath Screams I heard on the Oregon Bigfoot website.  It wasn't right next to us, it was some distance away, but it was loud.  Though we were all creeped out, we just brushed it off at the moment.  Later, I remembered your website and that Bigfoot/Sasquatches have been known to vocalize similar screams.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness, the following details regarding the vocalization are added:He and two friends had been shooting off fireworks (not the noisy variety, as stated) for approximately twenty minutes before they heard what the witness describes as a very loud scream, low-pitched, but not a growl, lasting only one or two seconds in duration.  Witness states that while it did not seem to be coming from right up close to them, it was closer than anything they could have heard from either of the two local buildings, one of which is approximately a ten minute walk from the location, and the other a fifteen minute walk.  The witness reports that no other sounds or smells were noticed in conjunction with the vocalization.",

They attempted to take a photo with their phones, but by then it was too late.  The two witnesses were about 100 yards away from the animal.  About 2 - 4 minutes before they saw the animal, they heard something in the same direction that sounded like it may have been a deer in distress.    ",
