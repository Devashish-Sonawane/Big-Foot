I can't be sure of the year, but I can recall the time of year--it was late Fall, about 4-5pm in the afternoon. I grew up in a sub-division called Ben Oaks on the Severn. Theres a steam that runs by Shipey's Choice and Ben Oaks across the road. At that time Shipey's Choice was a new sub-division where homes were being built. The steam was at the bottom below two hills. I recall playing around the steam and following it back to Ben Oaks. I was alone and remember feeling like I was being watched. I looked up the hill in the area of the new sub-division about 250 ft. away and saw a bigfoot maybe 7-8 ft. tall. I didn't know what it was at first. It was dark brown and big. I didnt have time to think. I was 13 yrs. old and running like hell. It just stood there looking. I put it together later and never told anyone. I didn't think anyone would think I was telling the truth and kept it to myself.",
