At first thought that would be because someone had made the footprints and then hopped in their car and left. But, on second thought, if someone was making this scene they would want to make sure people were going to see it and would make the tracks much closer to town. Why would someone make fake tracks on the hopes that someone MIGHT see it? When they could make them somewhere that the KNEW people would see it. But anyways, since the tracks did not continue to the other side bigfoot and his kin may have taken the road.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "In the afternoon of March 13, 2008, the witness called me and we went over his track find.  The track size of the larger one, as compared to his father\u0092s boots, was approximately 5\u0094 longer and 4\u0094 wider than his boots. His father\u0092s boots were at least 12\u0094 long. The smaller track, per the witness, was about the size of his foot, and he was a 9 year old youth at that time.  What amazed this witness was how far those prints were impressed into the ground.  He and his father tried to emulate their depth with no avail. He also made the statement that they looked human, meaning that they had five toes on each track. The witness stated that the tracks were fresh enough, and he  thought they were made within the last day or so. He also stated that he couldn\u0092t tell how far apart the larger tracks were from each other, but the smaller tracks made several steps in between the large ones. The tracks were coming from the Sierra Nevada Mountains and headed toward the White Mountains, which makes their direction due east. The witness and his father followed these tracks for well over 5 minutes, or about a half mile, until they came to a paved road that had a barbed wire fence on their side of the road. The tracks then disappeared from their view, but they never were able to locate them again, even when they went to the other side of that one lane paved road to check on them. The father then left the witness behind and went to retrieve the camera that was in their pickup truck, but couldn\u0092t locate the truck and later came back to get the witness. They then followed this one lane paved road back to a possible old town site called Benton Hot Springs, and then were able to locate where their truck was parked. This witness didn\u0092t have the exact details of just where this track sighting took place, but I asked him a little more about what direction he and his father took when they left Bishop, California.  He stated they went north, and if they didn\u0092t not leave California, they would have to turn west when they got to the town of Benton, California.  From that point there is only one way they could go to get away from people, and that would going west on Hwy.120. Continuing on until one gets to a desert location and would have a one lane paved road headed south, one would have to turn south at a very small old town site called Benton Hot Springs. This is my best determination of where this track find took place, and is somewhere down this small road, which I believe is called the Yellow Jacket Rd.My wife and I were in this area about 10 or so years ago looking for ghost towns and old mines that were located in and around the Blind Springs Hills area south of Benton Hot Springs. There are cattle herding and loading gates in this area along this road. Though the habitat in this area seems unexpected for sasquatches, there are other reports from this vicinity, though not during this general time period.  See this report from less than 20 miles away.  At this point, there is only a 30 mile stretch between the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the White Mountains, only 9 of which would be considered desert with little cover.",
