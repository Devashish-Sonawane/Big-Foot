            "Follow-Up Report": "I performed a site visit to this location and the following can be added.I received an email from our hotline stating that vocalizations were heard recently from the location.  I went to the site to see what the area was like.  I did not know of this report that had previously been submitted years ago.  The audio that was received was enough to pique my interest in this location.  The audio that was emailed to me, was recorded on February 12th.  The witness and I exchanged emails for a couple of days, getting a chance to go to the site on February 15th.  The witness also explained to me that he heard some vocalizations the previous night but did not record them.  He stated that they came from the northwest of his parents' house.  He has left a window open to hear if he can record anymore vocalizations.  So far he has not heard anything else.The witness moved to the Los Angeles area years ago, and only came back to see his parents and house sit while his parents were away.  He did not expect to have anything happen.  He was on the porch with his girlfriend and they were talking before she left to go home.  He recorded the vocalization with an app on his phone. \u0093Stark County Vocals\"The witness and I drove around the area of his previous experiences and so I could \"get the lay of the land\".  The spot from his previous experience in now owned by another person and we were not able to walk to the exact spot where it had happened.  I did notice the pine trees that are there, but a house had been built since this encounter that is back in the woods now.  The site looks to have been a strip mine in the past, and an old coal mine system was also there.  The witness states that the coal mine had a cave that was extensive enough that water filled the lower parts of the former mine.   While we drove around I noticed two different power-line draws that are in the area.  One to the south heading towards the northeast, and one to the north heading west.  There are many small ponds and a couple of lakes in the area also.  Also noticed were three orchards within a couple of miles of this location.  The area also has many farms with animals on them.  A couple of small creeks are in the vicinity.  From this report the following can be added.  I verified this report from one of the other witnesses. The being that he saw was only about fifteen feet away from him.  He only saw it in silhouette, but did describe it as huge.  He was at the top of the rise and this is why he cannot give an approximate height to the animal.  The animal was heading to the east when it passed by him.  This area is not very far from Minerva Ohio, which was part of report #4977 and the Minerva sightings of the 70's.The original cassette tape recording was lost long ago.  ",
