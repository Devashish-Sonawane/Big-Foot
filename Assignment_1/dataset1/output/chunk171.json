            "Follow-Up Report": "[Note: This sighting was submitted on behalf of the witness. The BFRO prefers, when possible, to receive written information directly from eyewitnesses. Barring a handful of exceptional cases from the past, reports are only posted after someone representing the BFRO has made direct contact with the witness(es).]Investigators R. Roberts and A. Higgins spoke with J. H.; Roberts met with him in person. The witness is retired from the military and is currently a government employee. He described himself as a bigfoot skeptic (confirmed by others interviewed during the course of the investigation), at least until his sighting. While still perhaps unwilling to state unequivocally that he observed a sasquatch, J. H. was certain of what he saw and concluded, \"All I know is that something is going on up there.\" The area in question is mountainous, rough and remote, accessible by ATV at best. The following is a summary of his experience. While sitting in a tree stand hunting deer, J. H. noted movement in a large tree about sixty yards north of his position (his stand faced west). Because of the black coloration, his initial thought was that a crow or some other large bird had landed. This momentary impression quickly evaporated as he realized the motions were those of an arm, not wings, belonging to an animal much larger than a crow.The estimated height of the creature, which he was now sure represented a primate of some sort, was at least three to four feet. It was observed for about six seconds.  The animal most reminded him of a chimpanzee, but the color of the facial skin was dark brown; J. H. emphasized the absence of the distinctive pinkish face typical of chimps. The animal was standing erect on a branch about twelve feet or so above ground. J. H. said he could not see the feet or lower portions of the legs. The animal appeared to look at him, then turned and vanished into the foliage. His sighting may well have been that of a young sasquatch. ",
