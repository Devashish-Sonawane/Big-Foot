It was next to the mail box for 4472 on 43, where there is a gravel poured drive.  At first I thought it was a deer, about same coloring, but as I got closer I noticed it was not a deer at all, it was much taller, about 6 ft., from the hips down. As I got closer it appeared the Mom (I assume that since there was a baby with it) put the baby down and was bending over for rocks?  At that time the baby looked right at me and it looked just like the Wukie (?, the furry, hairy creature) on Star Wars and it had a brown looking nose.  The baby seemed as surprised to see me as I was them, I guess WE look like aliens to them.  The baby was about 3 ft., it hit the mom at mid thigh.  I painted circles around the footprints I found the next day, 3 prints, with about a 36\u0094 stride.  The first print you come upon is the best, prints are difficult to produce in gravel, but the first one is in fine gravel.  There are two circles next to each other where it appeared the mom put the baby down.  They were headed into the woods and although there are deer around, there was a path worn in that direction.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness a few days after she filed the report.  She was driving west towards Peaks of Otter at 11:38pm when she witnessed a bigfoot crossing the road in front of her.  The following is a street/motorist view google map of the sighting location, note the mailbox on the right hand side of the road.  Her initial thought was that it was just a deer, but a second later she realized that it wasn't a deer, but was a Bigfoot.  She could very easily see the bottom half of this creature in her headlights, but couldn't see the top half very well.  The top half was dark because it was taller than the headlights beam.  The lower half appeared to have reddish brown colored hair that was about 6\" long.  The hair didn't appear to be thick, but had a fine texture to it.  After this animal crossed the road, it stopped just past the edge of the road and squatted down.  It did this to place a young Bigfoot child down on the ground.  This child was about 3' tall and came about mid thigh on the adult.  The adult did not stand back up straight afterwards, but stayed stooped over.  The witness thought that it was preparing to protect its child at all costs.  She believe it was probably picking up a handful of rocks, but she couldn't be sure of this as it didn't throw any rocks at her car.  As soon as the child's feet touched the ground, it turned and looked directly at the car.  The witness said that she got a very good look at the child.  It had a brown nose that stood out a bit in the headlights.  The child's eyes were glowing bright white.  She didn't know if it was glowing on its own or if it was only a reflection from the cars headlights.  But she saw them from about 15' away. The witness did not stop the car.  The next day she had her landscaper go by this location to look around.  There were a couple of tracks in the gravel, but they were not very detailed.  Although, there was a dead deer laying very near to where she saw the Bigfoots.  This deer was not there the previous night.  Her phone call to the police generated the news article at the bottom of this report. ",
