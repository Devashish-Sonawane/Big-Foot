            "Observed": "One night I was riding my off road motorcycle on the family property when I stopped to pet one of our dogs. I shined my flashlight at the dog when I noticed behind the dog something was squatting in the ditch. I shined my light on the thing in the ditch and it stood upright. What I was looking at was a tall hairy creature of some sort that had very wide shoulders and glowing green eyes. I quickly panicked and jumped back onto my motorbike, started it up, and raced away. The creature started to chase me down the old railroad towards my house. I knew it was chasing me because since I wasn't wearing a helmet, I could turn around and see the creature running after me. As I approached a pond area, I hit a ditch and flipped my motorbike over and became scuffed up. At this time, the creature stopped chasing me and starting walking towards me. I panicked again and started my bike by rolling down the hill and letting the clutch out. As I approached my house, I wrecked again at the base of our driveway and ran to the house. The creature followed me to my house and didn't leave until I turned the large floodlight on in our front yard. I feel like the creature could have caught me at anytime. Then, it ran off to a dried up swamp area and I didn't see it again.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "J.C. said when he initially saw the creature it was only 10 feet away. He estimated that it was at least seven feet tall and around 400 pounds. The hair was a brownish color and its face looked real pudgy with a pushed in nose. The next day J.C. and his older brother went back to the area to investigate. They found large humanlike footprints that were much larger than his brothers size 12 shoe. He estimated they were 15 inches long and very wide.",
