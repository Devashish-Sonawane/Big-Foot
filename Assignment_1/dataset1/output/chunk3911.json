One deer jumped out and almost landed on the hood of my jeep. We got to the campsite and I got on an ATV to go gather firewood. I was heading to the back of the farm and there was an awful smell. I looked to my left and in the creek I saw a creature that looked like a large ape or bear. It looked right into my eyes, I couldn't move, we stared at each other for what seemed like forever but it was probably about 30 seconds, then it turned its head and from a squatting position it jumped up an 8 foot bank and ran in the other direction. I drove back to the campsite and after I calmed down, we both grabbed two guns each and went back to where I saw the creature. When we arrived at the spot it was getting dark and we didn't want to stay around after dark. We returned to where I saw the creature in the morning to look for footprints, but the creeks were flooded from the storm and we found no evidence.",
