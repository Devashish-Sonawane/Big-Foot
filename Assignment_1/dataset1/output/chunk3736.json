            "Observed": "My 14 year old daughter and her friend were quadding in the woods behind our property which are owned by timber companies. They stopped by the waterfalls to look around and came upon a large footprint on the timber trail. It had rained a couple of days prior to this. There are lots of cedar groves and pine in the area and lots of fresh water from streams and waterfalls. They took some pictures with their phones and with my daughter's friends foot next to it. They told me about it when they got home and showed me the picture. My daughter took me up there and we saw more prints coming down the hillside to the trail and crossing it into the cedars. The trail is not very wide so this is the only print on flat land. I tried to get a plaster cast but did not have enough plaster and it rained before I was able to get more plaster and the imprint was washed away.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On Febuary 11th, I spoke to the mother by phone, and she stated that when her 14 year old daughter and her friend were quadding on a dirt road in the woods behind their property to see several of the waterfalls. They stopped by the larger waterfall to look around and came upon a large footprint on the road that came off a game trail. It had rained a couple of days prior to this, which altered the foot print a little. Her daughter took some pictures.The mother sent me the photo's and the print with her daughters friend foot next to the large foot print. She stated that the foot print slid a little in the mud. The friends shoe size was 7 1/2\" long. With the short slide of the Bigfoot print, and using the shoe size, the Bigfoot print appears to be approximately 16\" long and 7 1/2 to 8\" wide. You can see the outline of the big toe, but the other toes messed together do to the recent rain.  She also sent me a photo of the track line that appeared to be bipedal with very wide strides coming down the hill. There were no measurements of the foot strides taken.",
