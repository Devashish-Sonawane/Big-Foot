She was so afraid she couldn't stop laughing (I know strange), but she was actually laughing because I jumped so quickly back into the car.  She was still in the car.

After 20 seconds of being out of my car, my sister said someone was coming.  After she said that I heard branches breaking to the side of the road where the woods are.  I glanced to where the sound was coming from and saw a tall dark animal running toward my car.  The animal had to be 7-8 feet tall. After I saw the thing running from the woods on the side of the road, I ran back into my car.  I was scared.  When I first saw it, the thing was running from the woods towards me and my car.  I'm like, we're outta here.   It ran like a man, upright, It was 11pm, so naturally the color was dark in appearance.  But from my taillights, I'd still say it was dark in color.  And it moved fairly quickly.  Which is why I jumped back into my car so quick.  As I sped away, I tapped my brake lights and saw the thing standing in the road looking at us as we drove away from it.  It was a really creepy feeling!. I still remember it clearly to this day.  It was so errie.",

As I was walking I heard the neighbors' two German Shepherds barking furiously at something in front of their home in New Lebanon. Their dogs bark at anyone walking by, but I could tell their barking was more serious sounding this time. I stared through the darkness and noticed a silhouette of something huge. My first thought was that maybe a loose horse? Then it came a little farther South on Clayton Rd. and I could clearly see a huge and thick human like shaped silhouette against the other lights from houses. I thought to myself \"Man that is a really big guy and he is running super fast!\"",
