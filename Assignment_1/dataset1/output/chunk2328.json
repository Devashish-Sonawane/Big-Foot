It was a clear night with a bright, full moon. The animal was squatting, thighs parallel to the ground. In this position, the animal was about four feet high. Its left hand was grasping a tree. Its right arm hung slightly away from its body and in such a way as the back of the hand was visible. The body was slender, not large or stocky. The witness suggested that the body looked more like a monkey or orangutan. The head seemed more human like and was out of proportion to the rest of the body. The witness did not observe any facial features.The witness described the hair as \"green\" but explained the hair wasn't actually green. The moonlight reflecting off the animal gave it an odd, grayish-green hue.The witness's friend will not talk about the incident and would rather forget the whole thing.",

            "Observed": "It was late October of 2008, unsure of the exact date. At approximately 2:30 am, my oldest son called me on his cell phone. I was upstairs doing some research on the computer & he was downstairs on the back porch smoking a cigarette. I could tell by the tone of his voice that he was scared or excited about something. He said, \u0093You need to get out here right now, and bring the spot light and the shotgun with you!\u0094 I immediately retrieved both items from my bedroom and met him on the back porch. His eyes were as big as dinner plates and he looked a little pale. Now, my son (18 @ the time of this sighting) started hunting the swamps of north FL with me when he was 4, and he is normally very calm & doesn\u0092t get spooked or excited very easily. So, when I saw him like this I knew something had definitely gotten his attention.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness several times via phone & e-mail I would add these details to his description of the encounter:When this incident occurred, the witness along with his whole family were at home. All but he and his 18yr old son were sleeping. As described, his son was on the back patio smoking, which was a routine occurrence. The witness' son has grown up in the outdoors, hunting, fishing, camping, etc. He is familiar with the wildlife in this area, and does not get startled easily. When the witness heard the fear in his son's tone, he became concerned and followed his son's instructions to bring a weapon and light and come downstairs. The backyard is laid out in such a way that the back patio is approximately ~30 yards from a large oak tree. To the right of the oak tree there is a ~4ft. gap of space followed by a small shed. Likewise to the left there is also a ~4-5ft. gap and another shed. As stated the oak tree is ~3.5-4 ft. in diameter. When the father first saw this figure it was facing the shed to their right (The left of the figure) turned at an oblique angle. This allowed the witnesses a view of the right profile and some of the back. It would then take what the witness described as a \"half step\" back behind the tree. It was unable to move to the left or right without being in full view due to the gaps between the tree and the sheds. Behind the tree and sheds is 10-15 yards of open grass followed by a dense tree line and a fairly steep drop off. The final time that the witness and his son pointed the light at this creature, they got the best view of it. It had taken a \"full step\" out from behind the tree towards them. No part of it was obscured by the tree at this point. It was squarely facing them, but was slouched over more than it had been previously, almost crouching. The witness was able to see the face. Which was covered in shorter hair than the rest of the body. He estimates the facial hair at between 1-2 inches in length. The facial hair was thin enough than he was able to see dark colored flesh beneath it. He estimates that the rest of the body hair was between 4-6 inches in length. He insists that the creature was covered in reddish-brown hair, not fur. The brow ridge was quite pronounced and the nose was flat, much like an ape. The final time the light hit this creature, it used both hands to cover its eyes. It did not use open palms but rather loosely clinched fists and its wrists to shield itself. When it stepped behind the tree this final time, it used the tree as a shield to block its retreat, though the witnesses could clearly hear running and crunching of branches once it reached the woods. The witness estimates the height at ~7ft. He also recalls that it was very broad and muscular. \"He looked like a big beefy football player crossed with Michael Jordan.\" This witness and his son believe that this creature meant them no harm, that it was simply curious about what they were doing.This witness has agreed to work with an artist to recreate what he saw that night. When the sketch is complete it will be added to the report. ",
