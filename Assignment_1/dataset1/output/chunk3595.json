            "Observed": "My best friend and I had an Bigfoot encounter back in the early 1980\u0092s. We were fishing outside of McCall Idaho at an upper mountain lake, when it started to get so dark we decided to headback to the truck. As we got down the trail, a storm started to move in, and it became very dark, started to rain with high winds. Unfortunately, we did not bring a flashlight and got off the trail by accident. We were moving slowly through very thick brush when we heard a noise ahead of us. Some sort of animal was stepping away, we thought it might be a deer, until it turned around and looked at us. It was so dark that night, you couldn\u0092t see your hand in front of your face. But when this animal turned to look at us, it eyes were bright fluorescent green, illuminated like flashlights! We could tell we were in a large flat area, and these bright green eyes were taller than we were, 7-8 feet off the ground, and about 50-60 feet away. My friend and I had hunted for years together, and we both felt comfortable in the woods. But all of a sudden we both got a bad feeling, and we felt very uncertain about what this animal actually was.",
