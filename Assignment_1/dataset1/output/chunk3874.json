They dropped their guns and backs and knealt down at the River's edge. As they were drinking, they heard noises coming from across the River....brush rattling, sticks breaking, etc. They got their guns and prepared to get a deer and were surprised when a large, brown figure came trotting out of the brush and headed downshore a bit before crossing over to their side of the River. At first they thought it was a bear, but then saw that it was running on two legs like an ape or man. Realizing it had crossed over to their sides, they decided it was smart to cross over to the other side and head back upstream to their trucks. They kept on their toes until they got back to the road, but didn't hear or see anything strange the rest of the day.",
