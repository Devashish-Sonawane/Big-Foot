            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness, who is a wildlife biologist and a capable observer of wildlife, added a few details during our conversation:* He spends a good deal of time in the Blanca Peak area.  He reports that \"it rains all the time up there\"...he's never been up there without it raining.  This is potentially significant in this semiarid region.* While he recalls there were a few people in the area during the few days his party was there, he's confident that he was not hoaxed.  There was nobody around at the time of the sighting.* The 2nd witness, a good friend of his, he reports to be a capable observer as well.  They often go hunting and fishing together.  The 1st witness provided the 2nd witness with my contact information and I am hoping she chooses to contact me with her perspective of the encounter.* The sighting occurred between approximately 4 - 6 pm.  This is a very rough approximation of the time derived by considering the season (spring) and the lighting.  It was early evening but not dark and shadowy.* He was surprised at the lack of sound from the movement of the animal.  Neither padded footfall like bear, nor hooved footfall like deer, elk, or sheep.  No sound at all.* The witness doesn't know whether or not their camp was visited by the animal.  Camp was located approximately a mile from the sighting in the bottom of the valley.The encounter occurred within a mile of the common intersection of Huerfano, Alamosa, and Costilla counties.  It is also about 2 miles from a summer 2000 sighting near Como Lake (see Alamosa county).  The Blanca Peak area is rich with historical references to a sasquatch-type creature.",

It was a throaty, gutteral huffing noise. Only the pitch never varied to a higher one at the end, like a bull bellowing. Only the so-called bull never left with the herd. That, and I never recalled seeing a bull in the herd. Then, after 15 or 20 min. of the huffing in front of us, it got quiet.  Then my Sister heard a noise behind her in the woods, that sounded like an angry growl. I told her it was only the dogs growling at something. She informed me both my dogs were right there with her, and it wasn't them. So, she pulled out a pistol and turned and faced the direction it came from, and I went to get my rifle, and slung it across my back. Then, it got quiet and we didn't hear anymore of that during the night. Whatever it was knew what a gun was. My dogs never barked or went to investigate anything. They stayed right with us. They are watch dogs at my home, and have been camping numerous times. They seemed to want our protection this time.",
