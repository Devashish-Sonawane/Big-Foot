            "Follow-Up Report": "Note:  The highway to Cottonwood Shoals is not on Highway 32, There is a junction which turns left off of Highway 71 and that is where Alleene is located.I spoke with this witness by telephone and these details may be added to this report:The nearest home was approximately five miles from the campsite.The campsite was not a publicly frequented site, but back in the woods down a dirt/gravel road. The road had been used by a logging operation previously.The female witness who had walked outside the campsite to relieve herself observed the creature from within 15-20'.  Description of the creature is as follows:The creature was in full view, not hidden behind foliage.The creature was standing erect with a slightly stooped posture.Estimated height was 6' 5\" - 7' tall.  Weight was not estimated during telephone interview.Whitish in color with hair/fur 4\"- 6\" on torso, but shorter around the head and face.The creature had a pointed head as in a sagittal crest.The creature was described as having eyes which reflected red so brightly they looked as if they glowed.The creature was described as half man half ape looking.The witness who submitted the report stated he did not sense aggression in the creature initially and thought possibly it was only curious or hungry.  The creature startled the female witness who then startled the creature.  In making its escape it ran into the passenger side of their pick-up truck just behind the cab causing a large dent in the vehicle.The creature came back to their camp while they were hurriedly packing up to leave.  It was observed to  cross the logging road twice and the older brother noted it to be circling the camp. Due to the increasingly aggressive behavior of the creature he fired a shotgun 3-4 times in its direction.  It moved rapidly with an upright gait bipedally and was never noted to drop to all fours.  Before leaving, the father and older brothers noted both left and right footprints at the area where it slammed into the pick-up.  Witness said they were very good prints in soft moist soil  clearly revealing three toes on each foot, the middle being the longest of the toes.  No casts were taken of the prints.The witness reported during the first camping trip, while playing around a large pile of gravel near an old abandoned house, he heard a cooing/whistling type sound.  He stated on a later interview it was very similar to a vocalization from my files.A second incident occurred 5-6 years later 5-6 miles away with another whitish creature.  They were again camping and the same female witness observed the creature peering into the tent window.On another occasion a brother was hunting in this general vicinity and noted cane  growing in the area to be bent over creating a trail to a slough.I found this witness to be most credible and willing to speak openly about his experiences.",

            "Observed": "Well i live in bentonville Akansas right now, my dad own his own buisness. One Day we got on the subject i was telling him that i had bought a little book of ghost stories and bigfoot sightings and how i was very  itrested in bigfoot. Then he told me that he seen bigfoot before and he told me the whole story. At fist i didnt belive him, but a couple of years later he told me the same story when we got on the topic again. The story is that he was riding ATVs with his friends around or in ether lost bridge lake of bever lake and he was at the front of the group of 4-wheelers and they were going down this hill that led to a dirt road. Since he was in front of the group he went down first and got on the dirt road and stopped to wait for the rest of the group to come down. before they came down he lokked over across the dirt road on the other side of the hill on the tree line where the evevning sun was shining through the trees and seen the big foot walking. He said it was taking really big steps and apered to be 7-8 feet tall. He couldnt se the color because the sun was shining through the trees and big foot so you know it apeared as a shadow. Then the rest of the group came down and he told them what he saw and they didnt belive him. Thats all he told me. He told me he coudnt remeber every detale. But he still knows more than me, i cant remeber everything. The reason i'm telling you and not him is that i probably coudn't get him to get on here to tell you this. I'm telling you this because im learnig about bigfoot in our biology class at bentonville high school. my teacher is a marine biologist and a cytozoologist. We watched the big foot movie and the legend of boggy creek in class. Plus the sightings in Decator which is write by our town. So all this bigfoot stuff is making me so excited to dicover the bigfoot and do my part in adding another unreported sighting, since i know theres got to be alot of them out there. If you need any more info i dont have a phone but you can write me at (Withheld)  my name is (withheld) or you can call my dad who was the one who seen it at (withheld)",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Mr. G, the actual witness of the encounter in a telephone interview and the following details can be added to the report:Mr. G was a cold call because he had no idea a report had been submitted by his son J, and had never heard of the BFRO.  He retold his encounter to me honestly and matter of factly.Mr. G stated he and some friends were riding 4-wheelers in the Posey Mountain area and being somewhat of a daredevil, he was the first to go down a hill in this region.  He said while waiting for his friends to come down the hill he rode around at the bottom to kill time.  While looking up the other side of the hill he noted an animal standing bipedally appearing to reach up into the branches of a tree.  Mr. G is an avid hunter and stated, in his opinion, this was no bear.  His distance from the animal was approximately 150 feet.  He stated it surprised him and he rode back to where his friends were urging them to go look.  He stated by the time he got back to the area the sighting took place the creature turned and strode upright back over the crest of the hill and out of sight.  He stated it was covered in hair from head to toe.  He said he did not get a good look at the facial features, however, he felt they were hairy as well.  He said the creature was thinner than would be expected for an upright bear with longer legs. and a long gait as it walked out of sight. He stated it walked smoothly more in keeping with a human gait than that of an animal.  He said the animal's height he thought was around 6 feet, but could have been as much as 8 feet.  He was unsure of this detail.  His friends saw nothing as they were behind him.He said that he does not believe in UFO's or ghosts, or even bigfoot until this encounter.  He is a little reluctant to call what he saw a bigfoot but was confident it was no bear or anything else native to the area.  As stated earlier, his matter of fact attitude and clear retelling of the encounter leads me to believe this gentleman indeed observed a sasquatch.  ",
