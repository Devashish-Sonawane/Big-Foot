            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness by phone for an hour and a half. He had a very good knowledge of the area and the wildlife that inhabit it. He stated that the largest creature seemed to be the leader of the group, as this one was the first to make eye contact with the witness and his friend, and continued to do so throughout the duration of the observation. The witness could not determine the exact size of the other three creatures, or if there was a female present, due to his distance involved, but he had the strong impression that it was a family group he was observing. I have traveled through a part of the general area to and from work for the last fifteen years. This particular location has remained basically the same up to this day. The area has a history of flooding and therefore has not been developed much. ",
