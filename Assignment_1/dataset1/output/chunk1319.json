He emphasized several times the loudness of the sound \u0096 saying it was \u0093unbelievably loud\u0094. He said it was hard to tell exactly where it came from but that it was somewhere below them. It was a sound he\u0092d never heard before and has never heard since, and he said it sounded like a big animal. He said the sound lasted about one minute or so and was off-and-on, two or three times, rather than one steady sound. The witness said he and his friend didn\u0092t think about a bigfoot making the sounds or coming through their camp until the next day when they met the riders on horses. He doesn\u0092t remember if they said they saw a bigfoot or heard one or what, but remembers something about one scaring their horses. The witness has spent a great deal of time in the outdoors, hunting and fishing, but said that in all his time in the outdoors he has never felt scared like on this trip. He said it's the only time he's left a trip to go home a day early. He said there was something in the air \u0096 a forbidding feeling that something didn\u0092t want them there.",

The next morning my friend asked me if I heard something. I told him that I did and I just did not think anything about it. I asked him what he thought it was. He said it was definately walking on two feet and it was not a person. By the sound of the breaking branches he said it had to be big. It was late October and the ground had a lot of leaves and sticks on the ground. We where at campsites 14a and 14b if I recall correctly. Arrowhead Campground is located near Badin Lake and wildlife is abundant including deer. My friend was a skeptical before that but he was a little stifled by the sounds we heard that night. I asked him if it could have been a horse wandering from the above horse camp or a bear and he said it was walking on two feet like a man but had to be much larger because of the amount of noise of the breaking branches and leaves. We were only around 10 meters from the wood line. We are both professionals in our jobs and he is very trustworthy. I am an Army veteran a have a lot of time in the woods of N.C. GA. TN.",
