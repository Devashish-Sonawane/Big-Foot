            "Follow-Up Report": "**** Follow up investigation was done by B.C. of Ohio ****I went to the home of the 17-year-old boy who made this report. He lives out in the sticks with his family in a trailer with the woods just a few steps from their front door. I talked to his parents to make sure it was okay since he is only 17. They said okay but didn't believe he had seen a Bigfoot\u0085according to the father they do not exist\u0085however they were friendly. I interviewed the boy and went over much of the original report. He claimed that while hunting alone he was headed for home in the late winter afternoon when he smelled something like garbage when rounding a bend in the trail. He then saw a large creature with its arms around a tree looking up. At first he thought it was a bear until it turned toward him rather stiffly. He described it again seven feet tall, shaggy brown hair, massive build, hair covering face, but he could see its eyes and partially open mouth. When we visited the area, we reenacted relative positions and it was 25 feet or so from him to the creature. They glared at each other for a few minutes or so. When I remarked as to a few minutes being a real long time he remained steadfast but admitted he didn't look at his watch. When he went to remove his rifle from his shoulder it growled with a menace and he stopped. At that point it looked behind itself towards the trail in the other direction. The boy took this opportunity to lay his gun on the ground and when he looked up it was coming his way and ran by him and veered off in the woods to its left at a very sharp angle. He said he ran after it a ways to see where it was going but it had disappeared.",

He is knowledgeable of the protocol used to attract and study Sasquatches and understands the behaviors suspected to be attributed to them. I spoke with him for about an hour and the following details can be added:> He is a law enforcement officer in the Phoenix area.> He has had other experiences in this same area since  1991 and has remained very interested in the subject of Sasquatch, especially in Arizona.> The first night there were no other campers observed within about 8 miles of their camp site.> The witness stated that his tent trailer was positioned approximately 60 feet away from the closest pine trees, and directly under a species of oak.  According to the witness, most of the small branches/twigs which hit the trailer were from pine trees, not oak trees.> No wind noise produced by air rushing through pine needles or oak trees was heard during the trailer shaking events. No one in the tent trailer was standing up and moving around during those events.  > The witness personally experienced the trailer shaking event 3-4 times during the night, but his brother, who stayed awake most of the night, counted 8 separate shaking events.>Just to rule out any seismic activity, I referenced the USGS earthquake data posted online for Arizona over those same dates and found no record of measurable activity.
