            "Observed": "This happened roughly in 1990, High Point State Park in NJ. Camping with my much-younger siblings. I was about 23, they were about 8 and 9. Camping area was around a small lake. Picture a straight road with a left-hand turnoff to the camping area. Campsites were accessed by a horseshoe-shaped access road that went around the lake. Hillsides sloped up from the far (non-lake) side of the access road.",

The following details can be added.The impression I got from this witness was that he was being ingenuous.The howls heard on this night were between 7-12 seconds long and started out as a low howl and then eventually climaxed. What the witness described to me, resembles the well known 1994 Ohio Moaning Howl.The area in and around High State Park has a rich history of  similar incidents and reports of sightings and vocalizations continue to happen in this area to this day.",

I was no more than nine or ten foot away from it. I was close enough to see the face clearly and the expression on its face. There was no fear shown in its expression. The hair on the rest of its body was dark, but it seemed like it was shorter. I mean it did not look shaggy. You could tell clearly that its arms were longer than ours. The hands fell right below it\u0092s waist. Its eyes were large. It walked upright like a man. I would estimate now that it weighed around five to seven hundred pounds, maybe more. I am not a hunter so I am not exact with weight of animals. All I can tell you it was huge, and mad my dad who was a big man look like a dwarf. It was dusk. We were coming from our tobacco field. We were headed to our tobacco barns. There was a small dirt driveway in front of this barn. There were woods on both sides of this dirt road and behind the barn. It came from the right where the barn was, woods was behind the barn, crossed in front of us, paused and looked straight at us. It then stepped across the rest of the road into the woods left of us.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I conducted a phone interview with the witness and her older sister about the report she submitted on (4/06/07).Witnesses described to me what they saw as children as they were riding on a tractor with their father when returning from the fields. It was just before dark and their father had just turned on the lights of the tractor, just as they approached the barn a very large bigfoot stepped out into the path of the tractor, at this time they were no more than 10-12 ft away. One witness said the bigfoot turned and looked straight at them, and showed no sign of being scared. When the bigfoot turned to look at them it did so by turning at the waist and did not turn its neck, witness stated that the animal appeared to not have a neck. They noticed that the eyes were large and eyeshine was red from the lights of the tractor. Height was estimated to be between 7'-8' tall range, arms hung down to side, hands were similar to a humans. Both the women described the hair as being dark in color and short and neat in appearance.After the brief encounter the animal stepped back into the woods with one long step. That was the last they saw of it. Her father later returned to the spot to see if he could find anything. He looked around in the woods but didn't see anything unusual. Witnesses have agreed to let me meet them in person. If possible we will return to the site of incident.",
