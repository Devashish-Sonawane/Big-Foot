            "Observed.1  ": "Green was glad to see the crowd. \u0093Five years ago, I joined the Bigfoot Field Research Organization (BFRO). I was just tired of doing this myself, a little discouraged, and had no one to talk to and share my hobby,\u0094 Greene said. Greene\u0092s interest in Bigfoot began when was working toward a master\u0092s in behavioral psychology. He wrote a thesis on group hysteria, and one of the subjects he studied was Bigfoot. He came to believe that Bigfoot was possibly a real entity, so the reading and investigation began. Greene, a lifelong public servant who worked in several government agencies, convinced the Animal Planet crew to stop in the Troy area on their way to filming a series on Bigfoot sightings. The film crew will continue on to Florida, Georgia, Oregon and Washington state. A six-show series is planned to air on Animal Planet this fall. Greene, now 69 and retired, moved with his wife to Salisbury two years ago. They wanted to be near family and to investigate Bigfoot sightings in the area. North Carolina is a hotbed for sightings, according to BFRO investigators who attended Saturday. John Pate, Tommy Poland and Olaf Seamen all told of the excitement of the hunt. Seamen drove six hours to join the search in the Uwharries, and he usually spends 10 weekends a year on the hunt. \u0093The more you look at something, the more the book opens up,\u0094 Pate said. While some see the hunt as pure entertainment, the BFRO researchers say the subject is no longer the stuff of fantasy. BFRO now boasts scientists and university researchers. David Pardue says he has pictures of his own sighting of a family of four Bigfoots. He claims to also possess evidence of territory marking by the creature. Pardue says that Bigfoot often twists a small tree, first one way and then another, laying it down to signify its territory. He says that Bigfoot can change his eyes to red, and makes an audible sound known to the investigators. Since Bigfoot, aka Sasquatch, is nocturnal, most of the serious hunting is done at night. \u0093I have had very little sleep for a week. The Animal Planet crew stayed out all week till nearly 5 a.m.,\u0094 Greene said. Greene usually doesn\u0092t allow anyone to accompany him on the hunt, and he said that after recuperating for a week or so he\u0092ll return to solitary searches. On Saturday, Bigfoot enthusiasts began to arrive about midday. Most came by car or truck, but there were horses and four-wheelers, too. Even a helicopter, arranged by the Animal Planet crew, flew over the activities. Matt Moneymaker, head of the BFRO, organized a grid search that started in a large hay field and moved into the woods. Television cameras and microphones surrounded the searchers as they looked for elusive clues. Moneymaker instructed searchers to spread out and stay at arm\u0092s length from each other as they formed a long line headed into the woods. He used a bullhorn to instruct everyone to look for hair on trees or barbed wire, nests of stick structures, trails cleared of twigs and limbs, and \u0093tall boy trails.\u0094 Tall boy trails have been cleared of tree limbs and branches up to 8 feet high. Hair samples were found, and the Animal Planet crew saved them for analysis. Greene said the crowd was about what he expected on Saturday. He only had time for a short interview while guiding the TV crew and searchers. \u0093Let\u0092s hope somebody gets lucky today,\u0094 Greene said just before the search for evidence of Bigfoot began. While the show is in production, Greene and his fellow Bigfoot believers will stay on the hunt. Popular baits to attract giant bi-peds are apples, peanut butter and candy bars. The most popular of the candy bars is the hard to find Zagnut. The Eldorado Outpost of course had them displayed at the register and the cashier said, \u0093We keep Bigfoot bait year round.\u0094 More on Michael Greene and his quest can be found at www.bushloper.net.",

            "Observed.1  ": "The Daily Argus-Leader at Sioux Falls devoted half of their front page to Susquatch and Little Eagle early last week and then sent two reporters and a photographer by plane from Sioux Falls to check the story.  The McLaughlin Messenger office and the Little Eagle Trading Post have been besieged by phone calls from news media all over the nation. Friday a man from Oregon who claimed to have photographed a Susquatch and who has produced a documentary TV film on the Susquatch affair held a lengthy conversation with Gary Alexander, owner of the Little Eagle Store, and said all of the accounts from Little Eagle were about the same as those of people who claimed to have seen the big creatures in Oregon.  Calls also came from the United Press, Associated Press and New York Times.  Wednesday night Nancy Chasing Hawk, Esther Thunder Shield and Myron Fast Horse at Little Eagle said they heard \"screaming and growling\" in the wooded area east of the rodeo grounds along a creek. They drove along the woods in a pickup and said the lights of the pickup picked up something in the dark with \"big, green, shiny eyes.\"  A plaster of Paris cast of a Bigfoot track was taken about 9 miles east of LaPlant. The creature was seen by Melvin Garreaux, Cheyenne River Tribal Councilman. Standing Rock Officer Verdell Veo and his son Jeff, 15, searched in the area and found the tracks in a washout. The foot is about two feet long. The following image is a scan from the newspaper article, to view a larger version of the photo, click on it.",
