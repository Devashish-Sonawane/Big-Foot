            "Observed": "In 1963 I was nine years old and living in North Fort Myers, Lee County, Florida. In the weeks before this happened to me, there were several sightings of bigfoot reported in the newspaper. One of the sightings had taken place in a wooded area not far from where I lived. Our house was on the corner of Estate Drive and another street I can't remember, near a canal.  We lived a block away from U.S. 41. On the corner was a street light that usually lit up my bedroom, which I shared with my younger sister and my grandmother.",
