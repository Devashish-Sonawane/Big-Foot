I had suggested that he try some wood knocks in the area and he submitted this report with the results.I met with the witness who works in construction and visited the area where he had heard the return wood knocks. The area is mixed industrial/commercial as well as individual homes and subdivisions. The swamp mentioned runs for several miles and is between a long mountain ridge and a major four-lane highway. There is abundant deer and turkey in the area as I see them almost every morning on my drive to work. The print found was on a powerline cut which runs through the swamp area and then ascends the mountain ridge and continues over and down the far side. The elevation at the top of the ridge is approximately 800 feet. The witness' wife was with him hunting when the track was found and has refused to return to the area. During this incident they both expressed a feeling of unease and felt they were being observed. The area outside the swamp is mixed hardwood and pine and is sparsely populated along the swamp area and ridge line but surrounded as mentioned with industry and scattered homes.As I live only twelve miles from the sighting, I will monitor the area and encouraged the witness to contact me should he encounter any other sign.",

My daughter and I share our home with 2 golden retrievers and it's not uncommon for my female to not want to go outside to do her nightly business for no apparent reason. Now, maybe there is. My daughter and I were in my bedroom around 9pm one night, when something slapped the side of the house so hard it shook. We looked around outside, from inside and saw nothing. 3 days later at around 3 in the morning, my daughter in her bedroom (directly above my bedroom, sharing the outside wall) woke up to a loud, house shaking slam followed by a loud growl. Her feet hit the floor upstairs at the same time mine hit downstairs...We assumed a bear, but never could figure out why a bear would hit the house and how it could hit hard enough to shake the house, waking us both up.",
