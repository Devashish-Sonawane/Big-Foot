She said that the head of the creature did have a kind of peak to it, like someone wearing a hooded sweatshirt.  She also speculated that the creature was around 7' tall, and weighed somewhere in the neighborhood of 180#.  She admitted she wasn't very good at estimating such things, but she thought it was extremely thin.  She saw the creature at a distance of \"3 or 4 van lengths away\" for a period of 3 seconds or so.  She and the other witness agreed that what made them think they were seeing something they hadn't ever seen before was as much the way the creature walked, \"A graceful, glidey walk,\" as its size.  She described the walk as, \"Alien kind of movement,\" not at all like a human would walk.  She said that she had seen bear in her time in VA, and that this was not a bear.  She also estimated that they were about 2/3 of the way through their trip when they saw the creature, which gives us a rough estimate of its location.  There are quite a few good sized creeks in that general area, and few houses.",
