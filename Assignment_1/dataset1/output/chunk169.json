            "Observed": "I was driving near the town dump about 1:00 in the afternoon around the end of June last year, it was raining very hard, a large figure came out of nowhere, I hit my brakes but was far enough back that I would not have hit it, there was a car coming at me the other way, it almost ran into the back end of that car, it turned a little sideways to avoid the car, that's when I knew it was not a person or a bear, when it turned it flung its arm up and back a little to miss the car, it was a little hunched over, its shoulders were extremely wide, I couldn't make out any facial features, it was covered in dark brown hair and appeared to have hardly any neck, it was about 6\" taller than the mini van it almost ran into, if it was standing straight up I would guess it was about 6 to 6 and a half feet tall. The whole thing only took about 2 or 3 seconds but it really shook me up. I have always hiked in the woods around here and done a lot of tracking animals of all kinds, I have never seen anything that would resemble a bigfoot track, I have always had doubts about people seeing these, but now I will never doubt it again. It won't keep me from the woods but I'll keep an eye peeled from now on.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was very eager to talk with someone about his sighting as he has only told his wife, and has kept it to himself since. He hasn't even told his daughter who he enjoys the outdoors with for fear of scaring her. In late June 2013 he was driving on Rt. 27 of Hanson in the pouring rain at 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon. He noticed a large figure in front of him crossing his lane and looking towards him crouching over. He stepped on his brakes and stopped. I later visited the location with the witness and we measured the distance of where he stopped the car and where the creature was in the road, distance was 70 yards. A minivan came from the other direction and just missed the creature. It looked at the van, twisted its body and flung its arms up and back, just avoiding contact with the van. The van passed and the creature ran the way it was heading. The witness then drove to where it entered the woods. He could see in about 50 yards in but saw nothing. When he saw it next to the van crouched he thought it was only about 4 ft. tall. When it straightened to avoid the van its head was at least 6 to 8 inches above the top of the van. He estimated it to be 6 to 6 1/2 feet tall and covered in dark brown hair. It had  long arms, huge shoulders and could hardly notice a neck. He did not notice facial features. He has spent lots of time in the woods, hunting with his father as a child and has seen all the animals indigenous to Massachusetts. He was pretty shaken up, his wife told him he was white as a ghost when he got home. He is retired from the Patriot Ledger newspaper and dismissed stories from the past and the nearby Hockamock Swamp. In his words \"I will never doubt anyone again\".",
