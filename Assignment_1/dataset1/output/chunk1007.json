            "Follow-Up Report": "I called the witness who reported the incident and arranged to meet at the exact spot where the interaction happened on 2/8/2012. The area is in a rural, mountain valley with scattered farms, thick forests and rugged terrain. I met with the reporting witness and some of the other witnesses at their home and asked them to explain exactly what happened and what they were doing. They were outside at about 6 or 7 in the evening just playing and goofing around. A woman there was making sounds with a piece of pvc water pipe and after a few minutes they heard a yelp from up on the mountain. They started making yelps and whistles back and the animal quickly started down the mountain towards them. Whatever it was always stayed just out of sight in the woods. At one point a boy took a dog to the edge of the tree line where the dog stopped and refused to go any further and became visibly frightened. The interaction continued for a few minutes then ceased. One adult there commented about a rancid smell.After talking with the witnesses I can add that other incidents have happened over the last several months at this location. The incidents include animal feed taken out of a sealed container, hunting dogs had to be dragged through certain areas of the woods, feelings of being watched, a game cam would take pictures of just woods and possible wood knocks. During our conversation, I told them that I believe sasquatch have a taste for sweets, especially honeybuns. They looked surprised and said that for months they had been trying to \"catch a coon in a box trap.\" They were planning on using the coon to train a hunting dog. They were using honeybuns and each time they checked the trap it was sprung but contained \"no coon and no honeybun.\"After talking with the witnesses and taking into consideration their knowledge of hunting, local animals and having lived in the remote area their whole lives, I'm certain that they interacted with a sasquatch and have been visited by them in the past.",
