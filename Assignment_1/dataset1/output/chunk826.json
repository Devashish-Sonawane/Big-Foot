            "Follow-Up Report": "Martin R. called me tonight and gave me a few more details of his and his friend's short sighting experience on the Rubicon River east of Georgetown California.  I asked Martin the following questions.  *Where did this incident occur? \"In the California Sierra Mountains.\" *What date did this take place? \"On July 18, 2001.\"*What time of year was it? \"Summer.\"\t*Was it day or night? \"It was during the day, late morning.\"*Describe the area in which this incident occurred. \"It was located in a steep sided river valley with lots of pine trees with poison oak.\"*Where in California did this happen? \"We went east about four miles from Georgetown, on the Wentworth Springs Road.\"*Near what area? \"We turned north on the first paved road past the Stumpy Meadows Lake, and we crossed the bridge that crosses the Rubicon River.\"*What distance would you estimate you were from this thing when you saw it? \"We were about sixty or so feet from the creature.\"*What was your first reaction? \"At first, we thought it was a black bear.\"*What was it doing? \"The creature was moving up a very steep rock filled dark crevice, which was across the river from us.\"*Were you alone when you first saw this? \"No, there were three of us who seen this creature.\"*What's is his/her name?  \"They are two friends of mine, and are both males, 27 and 28 years old.\".*Did it stand and walk on two legs? \"Yes, it was moving up the crevice, and it went from a crouching position to a walking position on its hind legs, and it was using its arms and hands grabbing the rocks and trees pulling itself up as it continued to climb up and into the crevice.\"*Did you see it go down on all fours? \"Hard to tell, because of the steep terrain, which was almost straight up and down.\"*Was it covered in hair? \"Yes, and it looked coarse.\" *What color was it? \"It was a dark brown that looked almost black.\"*How tall would you estimate this thing to have been? \"We are all over six feet tall, and this creature seemed to be at least six to seven feet tall even though it looked like it was crouching as it first moved into the crevice.\" *What would you estimate its weight to have been? \"I am 185 lbs., and this creature looked to be over three hundred lbs.\"*Did you see any facial features? \"No, It was moving up and away from us, but we all noticed that there was no snout on the face.\"*Could you describe them? \"We noticed no snout, and the face was lighter in color than the rest of the body.\"*Could you describe the arms? \"They were about three fourths the size of the legs, and didn't seem too long.\"*Could you tell if it was a male or a female? \"No!\"*About for how long did you see it? \"We only seen it for about three to four seconds.\"*Did it ever make any noise? \"No, We had a moving river between it and us.\"*Did it ever make any animal sounds from its mouth? \"No, it made no sounds that we could hear.\"*Did it see you? \"I didn't think so, but we left that area immediately after the sighting.\".               \t\t*Did you smell anything? \"No!\"*Did you check for footprints? \"No!\".*Did you report what you saw?  (i.e.) Parents or any agency? \"No!\"*In your own words describe what happened.  \"We were going up the river to try and locate a rock formation that we could use to jump into the river.  As we climbed up a rock embankment on the north side of the river, we observed what we at first thought was a black bear, moving on the opposite side of the river.  This bear/creature was up about as high on the south side of the river as we were, and it was moving into this very tight crevice. This crevice was five or six feet across and was very deep and dark with trees, brush and rocks in it.  We observed that it was using one of its hands or paws holding onto a tree as it moved into this crevice. As it moved from a crouching position to a standing position, it went from about four feet tall to well over six or seven feet tall, it then no longer looked like a bear.  When this creature was stretched out, it was thinner than a bear and very muscular.  We then left this area and headed back to camp.\"In summary:  Martin did state that he and his friends have never seen a bear in the wild before, and that they had a discussion on whether this creature was a bear or what. Two of them think it wasn't a bear, but something else like a bigfoot.  From what Martin described, I think they saw a bigfoot creature, and not a bear. ",

The encounter was near dusk so not many details were easily observable. He did describe the creature as having a stocky build with a wide upper torso, no observable neck, and being dark in color.  Also observed was a reddish reflection from the eyes due to the waning light. The estimated distance from the witness to the creature was approximately 20+ yards. The witness also recalled other incidents that were related to him by others over the years in that area.   ",
