            "Observed": "Hi Guys, I am going on over thirty sightings/encounters in northern Wisconsin. I've had as many as 4 up to my cabin at a time. Last October I was hunting when I saw a big silver big foot. he was at least 9-10 feet high. I was less than 20 yards from him. Was funny, I think he almost smiled cuz he was soo busted. I just laughed. I walked to the trail he was on and couldn't believe how fast he disappeared. Two weeks later I was in my cabin and turned towards my sink when I saw one leaning down to peek in at me. Made my neck hair stand up. went to the window and all I saw was a gigantic shadow from the yard lite. WAS AWESOME. If you folks ever want to come up... yell.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken to the witness on more than one occasion and find him to be a credible observer of activity on his property. The experiences he relates are detailed and numerous over time. In his report he references a night time observation where he \"called in\" 4 Bigfoots to his cabin, at dusk, by clacking 2 rocks together on his porch. They approached from the woods in a group, with the largest one getting angry, and screaming loudly at him, in what he described as \"blood curdling and made the hair stand up on his neck\". Two of them were within 20 yards, another 50 yards, and the last, 60 yards from him. He observed them for several minutes, until they dissipated back away from his property, into a ravine. Other experiences related include:In the fall of 2011 he saw a Bigfoot under the yard light of his woodshed, at 7 pm at night, after hearing rough breathing in his yard.In September 2012, while bow hunting in his stand on his property, a  \"silver/grey Bigfoot\" emerged from the wood line 20 yards away. It did not see the hunter initially, and he observed it for several minutes, until it left into the woods. Being 6' 3'' tall himself, he was able to gauge height of the creature against the trees, near to where he saw it, estimating the height at 9' 6\" and weight at over 600 lbs.Also in his report he tells of seeing a Bigfoot in his yard, outside his kitchen window, one evening near dusk, observing him while he was in his kitchen. He said it seemed curious, not threatening, and was extremely large.He has had campfires at night on his property, with his granddaughter and others, and they have observed Bigfoots \"peeking at them from behind trees in the woods\", when the children are laughing and making noise. He emphasized they do not feel threatened, as the creatures just seem curious.On several occasions while hiking and hunting his land however, he has heard or seen them and they break branches and/or tree limbs when he is around. He hears them whistling back and forth to each other when he is in the woods, sometimes knocking. He has heard screams and screeches at night, but finds it hard to distinguish, verses wolves that live in the area, so did not readily attribute these to the Bigfoots.He has had sightings early at dawn, mid-day, and at dusk. He has set up trail cameras, but has no pictures to share of them as yet. He found a large \"nest of sticks\" built on his land also.Sightings over the years also took place on his Father's property, nearby, he knows the land well, since he was a child having hunted and explored it thoroughly. Nearest neighbors are about a mile away. He believes the creatures are hunting for food in groups, following the nearby river, to large marshlands in the area.The witness describes the Bigfoots as follows:-Tall and muscular, some close to ten feet in height. No necks, and broad shoulders.- With thinner hair in the face area, they have \"people like\" facial expressions. The nose is flat, and heads are wide. Eyes are big and brown.- Except for the silver/grey creature, others are a dark brown to blackish color. -The smell when they are around is that of a \"rotten apple pie\" smell. He does not want to disclose his exact location in a public report, but has invited the BFRO to visit and observe when arranged.",

We were driving alongside a treeline when we spotted eyes shinning in the light about 150 feet away next to the trees. I had binoculars and one of my cousins had a 22. magnum with a scope. We had a very good view of a large biped covered with brown hair, except for white patches on the pecs (chest) and one of its arms. It was about 8' tall or more. It tilted its head down because of the light, but stayed in place for about 5 minutes then stepped across the fence on the treeline and disappeared into the woods. The face was like a man and an ape.",
