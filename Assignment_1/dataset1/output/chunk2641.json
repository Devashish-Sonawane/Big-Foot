I had a hard time accepting it. The sound was 100 to 150 yards away, if even that. It was extremely close.\"--- Due to the nature of the vocalizations that the witnesses heard, this investigation thinks that the most likely animal that generated the sounds was a sasquatch. --- Read the witness' girlfriend's report here.
