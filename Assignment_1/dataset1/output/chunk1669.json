We had been at this spot for about 45 minutes. I thought I heard a noise come from in front of us, like a rustling of the trees or undergrowth. I sat up and turned on the headlights and saw a very large creature standing about six feet from the front of my truck. It stood at least seven feet tall and possibly taller, was covered in dark brown or reddish brown hair. I quickly started the truck and backed away, when I turned back to get another look at the creature it was gone. I wasn't able to get a clear look at the face.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "\u0095 Witness had parked his truck right up to the woods. When he heard something immediately in front of his truck, he hit the headlights, which illuminated the area of the creature from the waist to the shoulders. Its face was not seen.\u0095 The creature was facing the truck. It was massive in the shoulder area being over four ft in width.\u0095 Creature was stocky and muscular with an approximate weight of 350 to 400 lbs. He estimates it\u0092s height being seven or eight ft tall.\u0095 Hair covered the parts of its body that he saw. It was two to three inches long, nasty and matted. It was auburn in color.\u0095 The witness\u0092 immediate reaction was for the protection of his occupant. He threw the truck in reverse, instinctively looking back and flooring the truck. When he looked forward again, the creature was gone. He told her, \u0093We need to get out of here!\u0094\u0095 The witness returned to the area within a week but did not see or hear anything unusual. \u0095 This sighting area is slightly west of the Big Thicket National Preserve.
