Coyotes returned in large numbers, bobcats made a come back and are quite common, my grandfather claims to have seen a small black bear in the intervening years on the farm (about 16 years ago), turkey, and other kinds of wildlife.  Lincoln State Park is to the north about ten miles of my grandfather's farm and a strip of woods still covers a lot of the area between the farm and the state park.",

At a sharp curve back to the south towards Chrisney, IN, you turn off to the east and follow a one lane country road east to an T intersection with a another country road.  You will be about 1/4 mile off 131.  Then you turn left on this gravel road and head north.  You will see the old barn and farmhouse just to your right.  Today a cell tower stands on the property which makes it easy to spot and identify.",

I slept up in the attic at night with my uncle Donnie who was helping my grandfather with his dairy farm.  We had just laid down when my uncle Donnie got right back up and headed downstairs.  I was on my stomach looking East out the window. (We had two windows in the attic for ventilation.  One was on the west and the other was on the east end.)",

The creature was in view from the headlights for about three seconds. It \"turned and looked toward the lights, then took off running\". The gait was described as \"odd, long strides with its long arms swinging by its sides\". The arms seemed to reach below knee length. He described the body build as on the thin side and it did not seem to have a distinct neck. He had no real impression about the length of the body hair. He stressed how unreflective the creature was, that even it's face did not seem to reflect much light.",
