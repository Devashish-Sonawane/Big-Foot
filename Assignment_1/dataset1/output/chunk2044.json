            "Observed": "A friend and I went driving to camp in Oregon on Hwy 199 in the fall of 1985. We didn't want to stay at a pay site so we pulled off on a side spur road in dense forest and set up a tent. We had our two malamute cross dogs with us who had been by our sides in many backcountry adventures.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Follow up from the Richardson Grove Encounter. I was assigned to Richardson Grove State Park (Southern Humboldt County, CA) for two years, June 97 to April 98, and I know that place pretty good. John and I decided to split up J.'s two sightings. I took the one at Richardson Grove and John took her other encounter off hwy. 199 (Del Norte County, CA). So between the two of us, we got the goods. The following is what was shared: On 11-16-99, I called J. at the witness's residence to follow up on the November 27th, 1985 encounter at Richardson Grove State Park. It was a drizzly, late afternoon, the day after Thanks Giving. It was 3:00 p.m. when the witness and a friend decided to take their dog for a walk up the \u201cWoodlands Trail\u201d.The witness was about \u00bd way around the 1.6 mile loop trail when the dog picked up a scent, from the forest shadows above them and then began to lunge up the side of the embankment on his hind legs, pulling strongly on his leash. The witness said they had taken the dog into the forest many times before, but this time felt that the dog behaved unusually strange. It was at that time they began to hear the loud crunching of the leaves and the braking of the branches, coming from the top of the slope above them.From where they were standing along the trail, couldn\u2019t see up the slope towards the disturbance because of the forested topography. They decided to curiously follow their dog a \u201cshort ways\u201d, approximately 10\u2019 to 12\u2019 up a steep embankment and then to the top of a nearby ridge, approximately 20\u2019 to 25\u2019 above the trail. The noise of the disturbance had stopped prior to their cresting the top of the small ridge. They thought for sure they would run into a bear when they reached the top, But what ever had made the noise was gone by the time they arrived.They were surprised to find that the lower branches on several of the nearby trees had been freshly broken off up to 10\u2019 above the forest floor. The diameter of the branches varied in size from very small to 3\u201d to 4\u201d in diameter. The witness said it wasn\u2019t the tops of younger trees that you hear about in some of the reports. These were the lower branches that had been broken off at the base of an older tree. On the top of the small ridge, in the forest duff just bellow the broken branches, they noticed some disturbance. When they examined them closer, they noticed the disturbances were actually foot impressions. The impressions appeared to be approximately 16 \u201c in length.They cautiously followed the impressions a \u201cshort ways\u201d farther up the slope. Along the way they noticed one or two of the large impressions looked very much like a human footprint. The witness claimed to have seen bear prints before, and was very sure that those were not from a bear. The witness had never seen any prints like those before. The witness noticed that the impressions did not have any claw marks, in the easier to read, softer soil. It was then that they decided to work their way, cross-country, back to the other loop of the trail and head back to their camp.\u201cWhy wait until now to report it?\u201d I inquisitively asked. The witness said I have spent a lot of time in the outdoors and has seen some very strange things before. At that time in the witnesses life, didn\u2019t feel the need to report it. It was a younger daughter who encouraged the witness to report the encounter to the B.F.R.O. Web site. The witness thought we would like to know. Respectfully, Robert. End report.",

My girlfriend and I were down almost under the bridge where we swam in the summer. It was still warm right before school started. I guess we were just goofing off down there. It was the best thing to do out in the country, we had so much freedom. We wandered the hills, forest and old logging roads all the time. I really don't remember what made us look across the river at exactly the same time. Maybe it was a sound or just a feeling. And it was only a flash. But between the trees I saw a huge manlike being running. It was dark in color, dark brown to almost black. And covered in hair. It had to be about 71/2 feet tall. I had lived out there and being a tomboy. I had prowled all through the woods. I had never been scared out there alone and even miles from home on my horse. What I saw was not a bear or a friend playing a trick. The way it ran was so human like. The way the arm was bent at the elbow and the knee. It stood up just slightly stooped. And it ran fast. It gave us a quick look while it was running and disappeared. We looked at each other and we ran home. As soon as we reached the house we talked. We had both seen the same thing. We ran inside the house to tell my parents. But of course no one belived.",
