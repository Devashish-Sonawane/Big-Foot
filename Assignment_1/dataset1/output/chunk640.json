Time of day was around 10 a.m.  It was standing in seawater about a foot deep, near a hammock of small trees, most likely mangroves or cypress. No more than 50 yards from the road, long arms were seen with hands just above the knees.  Due to the distance he was not able to see more detail than he described. It was still visible as they drove away.  This area is the very southern tip of the Everglades, close to the ocean and in the Everglades National Park.  He remembers the closest building being the Welcome Center located a few miles away.",
