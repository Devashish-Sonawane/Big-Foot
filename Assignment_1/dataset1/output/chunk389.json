            "Observed": "At the time of the sighting I was on duty as a Security Police officer in the U.S. Air Force at the Myrtle Beach AFB, SC. I was patrolling on a security road called the Serpintine at about 9 pm. The temperature was pleasant at about 69-73 degrees. The Serpintine is in a restricted area zone within the base and lies in a heavily wooded area. There was a full moon that night so I turned off my headlights to see if I could follow the road with just the moonlight... it was very bright and this was easy to do once my eyes adjusted to the darkness. I remember driving around a curve when I decided to turn my headlights back on. Much to my surprise I saw a creature in mid-stride just as it was about to leap over a ditch by the roadside. It made the jump with ease and disapeard into the tree line in about 3 seconds. The creature had light brown fur covering all of its body that was not long but it was not short either. As I had been trained to  report situations of any nature as correctly as possible I believe that the following information is fairly correct. The creature stood about 7-8 feet tall and probably weighed about 400 to 450 lbs. For its size and obvious weight it had remarkable agility and speed. The jump that it made cleared 14 to 16 feet with no problem. It had a body like a large human covered with hair.",

I stopped and was motionless for a couple of minutes when I heard a loud expulsion of air and a branch snapped behind me in the thick pine trees I had never heard anything like that before so I froze and did not move, and about one minute later I heard the same sound from a little farther away and then the next time I heard it, it was closer and to the north, this happened about six times each time it was in a different location like it was trying to see what I was and scare me off. The last time I heard it sounded like it was right behind me and I flinched then it must have seen me I heard it running away from me through the trees making the same noise and breaking limbs as it was running off. I stood in the same spot for about five minutes and did not hear it again. I walked out of the woods to my truck where my dad was waiting for me and we drove about a mile down the road to a campsite to eat lunch.",
