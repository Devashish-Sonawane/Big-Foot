It was early morning,dark and very still. We stood outside the truck talking when something let go a roar that made the hair on my neck stand up.Whatever it was, it was about 50 yards away and it wasn't moving.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with this person over the phone on 12/18/2005.The witness is an avid hunter for the last fifteen years. He has a very good knowledge of the local wildlife and the sounds that they can produce. He has hunted the spot where the encounter took place quite often. Two years prior to his sighting he and his hunting partner heard an extremely loud scream, which transcended into a roar, coming from the woodland interior.At the time of his encounter he was in a tree stand at dusk, when he heard something climbing down from a conifer tree. He then heard movement coming toward him; he was not sure what it was, until it moved into his line of sight, 10 to 15 yards away.The figure observed was completely black from head to toe. It stood upright at a height of six to six and half feet with a medium built. It swung its arms as it was walking bipedal deeper into the forest toward a swampy area. At the time the witness thought it was another person. The witness shined a small flash light on the figure and whistled twice, to acknowledge his presence. Upon the second whistle the figure stopped motionless and silent. The witness then started to descend from the tree stand. Before reaching the ground, he tried to shine the flashlight on the figure again, but could not find it.Due to the lighting conditions the witness did not make out any facial features. Afterward while heading back with his hunting partner and discussing the incident, the witness became aware of the fact that his hunting partner did not see anyone enter the woods from his location. The witness also realized that this figure was not carrying any kind of illumination device or hunting gear. He no longer hunts in this location because of this encounter.",

As I climbed over I noticed, 30 feet away another tree that was also laying on the ground. As I looked, I saw a Bigfoot, stooped over, watching me from behind the trunk. The face was a medium black, with a large brow bone that almost stuck out as far as it's nose. The hair was medium brown with light spots (light reflections?). It's face had darker lines where the skin folded. The face was smaller than one would expect on an animal this size. The eyes were brown and set a little closer than a humans. The nose was flat and wide.",
