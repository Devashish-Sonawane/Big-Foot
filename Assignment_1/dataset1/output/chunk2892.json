            "Follow-Up Report": " In this interview, I spoke with one of the main observers and his wife.  His son has not yet been willing to talk about the encounter.  Several things were pointed out to me regarding this experience that the witness described. -It was intimidating.  The creature was huge.  It walked with a swaying motion. It was noticed that it was silently walking toward the observers.  -There were three vocalizations.  All were loud, low and it had big lungs. In the last vocal, the sound seem to go on and on.-The view of the creature was from on top of the hill.  Had the road not been brightly contrasted (it was a chip and seal coat which made the road lighter in coloration) its possible that the viewers would have not seen the animal.-The guestimate on the shoulder width was  five or more feet.  The head was described as conelike and small for the width of the shoulders.-There seemed nowhere that hair was especially long. The comparison was made with a golden retriever with regard to hair.  The legs were obscured, probably by hair.  . The view from the top of the hill looking down was a factor in the observation as well.-The creature was heavily built and initially  thought to be a bear but there was no neck.  The concern was what bear walks on two legs?  Eventually both father and son left the area by getting in their auto and drove off.  Neither man feels comfortable outside at night at this time.  But they do understand the nature of what happened.  They were intimidated and left and not harmed. -In later correspondance, I was informed that the observer feels better regarding what he saw.  Its size was intimidating and after  thinking it may have been a bear that was approaching they simply left.     -Regarding the wife of the witness:  She stated to me that they initially considered that the object seen was a bear.  But they ruled that out and became amazed that perhaps they actually saw a bigfoot since no bear walks on two legs that distance.. No ears or snout were observed either.  With regard to a person in a suit, how would they know to be there on a lonely road at 2 am?  The size of the subject points to this not being a person.   There was no discussion of going to that general location until about 11 pm that night.  No one was told and they randomly ended up there. ",
