            "Observed.1  ": "Gonzalez says a local farmer saw a family of five or six Bigfoot running on his ranch in the middle of the night. \u0093One of them, which was extremely tall, had a pig over its shoulder. And the five scattered and the one with the pig was running so fast it didn\u0092t see an irrigation pipe and it tripped, with the pig flying over,\u0094 says Gonzalez. RELATED | Group reports Bigfoot sighting in North Carolina This story intrigued Gonzalez but did not surprise him. In the last five years, there have been three Bigfoot sightings, all in the same area in East Fresno County. \u0093I would have never guessed in a million years that you would have told me there were Bigfoot on Shields or Ashlan Avenue. Right? So, I want to know what\u0092s going on. Is this for real?\u0094 says Gonzalez. He says five years ago a woman called him saying her two sons had seen a Bigfoot in their orchard one afternoon. RELATED | Report lays out evidence from 4-year Bigfoot search A few years later, Gonzalez received a call from a man who said he saw five Bigfoot in an orchard across the street from his house. Turns out it was the same orchard where the boys had seen the Bigfoot years before. And now, a local farmer says he, too, has seen five Bigfoot on his property. \u0093What are the odds of three people, three different families, who don\u0092t know each other, within a radius of 2 to 3 miles, come and tell me what they witness, and it matches up,\u0094 says Gonzalez. On a Bigfoot expedition a few years ago, Gonzalez says he came back to his truck to find prints on his car. Those prints were tested by a local DNA expert. According to the tests, the print matched up with that of a gorilla. Gonzalez also has a footprint mold he believes is of Bigfoot, retrieved from the orchard. RELATED | Is Bigfoot in Ohio? A company's paying $1 million for tips to find the creature \"I believe there are a lot more people out there who have seen things and are keeping it inside themselves. They don\u0092t want to go out and tell people, they don\u0092t want to be ridiculed. They don\u0092t want to be made fun of,\u0094 says Gonzalez. He says now is the time to come out because he, along with several others in the Valley, believes that Bigfoot is back. If you think you\u0092ve seen something, email Gonzalez at SangerParanormal@aol.com.",
