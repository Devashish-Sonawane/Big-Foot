            "Observed": "I had just left the Cranberry River in the Monangahela National Forest where some family members were camping. I took a short cut through Cranberry Ridge that comes out in Camden on Gauley to get home. It was midnight (12:03 to be exact.) I was almost to the Webster County Line when I saw what I thought at first was some idiot in a monkey suit in the middle of the road in front of me. I beeped my horn at it.He started to run very fast, in long strides and then I realized it wasn't a man. He wasn't wearing shoes. His feet looked hairy. He was covered in reddish brown hair and about six feet tall. The hair was all even in length. He ran about quarter of a mile up the hill in front of me then tore through some elderberry bushes and disappeared down the mountain. I only got a really quick glimpse of his face so I can't accurately describe it. The next day I went back and looked at the spot where he ran through the bushes. There were some kind of prints in the mud holes in the road and the elderberry bushes were broken and bent where it went through.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to this witness at length about his sighting. Although it had been two years, he still has a vivid memory of that night. He has grown up in the mountains (which have many bears), and he is sure that he did not see a bear. He took his grandmother out where the incident happened, and she told him that the area was called \"yayhoo holler\". \"Yayhoo\" is a common name for bigfoot in the mountain regions of West Virginia. When the creature turned to look at him, he saw that it had a \"flattish, ape-like face\". The hair on the body of the creature was similar to an orangutan's hair. The area of the sighting is in the Monongahela National Forest, which is a remote million acre tract in West Virginia. There have been many sightings in the \"Mon\" over the years.",

It was a roar or growl.  I then left and we did not return.  Please contact me and I will give you specific details.  Mxxxx, Barnesville, Ohio",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On October 7, 2015 Jim Thompson and I met up with the witnesses. As we arrived at the house, two of the witnesses were ready to go, but the third refused to go back to the area. Before we left, one of the witnesses showed me the large rock that was thrown at them a few nights earlier. It had fresh scratch marks (as reported) and it was slightly larger than two grown man's hands placed side by side. Photo of the rock:We drove out to the location after dark. It was approximately 8 when we arrived. We went into the corn field (that still had standing stocks) to work our way towards the woods. The first location we stopped at was in the field where the rocks were thrown a few nights before. I asked where the rocks were thrown from and one of the witnesses stated that they came from the wood line. We continued into the woods retracing their steps from a few nights earlier. They eventually led us to the location where they claimed to hear the vocalization. He stated that the vocalizations began as a growl/grunt but became more of a scream or screech. At this point I asked one witness to stay with Jim and the other to go with me to the area they thought the vocalization came from. The area's terrain had a lot of deep ruts and valleys. We crossed a creek to the area where he thought it was standing. At this point we were only about 40 yards from Jim and the other witness, but could not see them because of a hill between us. There was clearly a worn path, but no definitive footprints. However, there were worn areas about 15 inches in length that could have possibly been tracks. We spent several hours on location, but there was no signs that night. We returned one other evening and spent a few hours again with no other indications of something present at that time. I did survey the area during the day. It is very desolate and there are caves in the area.",
