            "Follow-Up Report": "The gentleman hunts Elk in a very remote area of the Big Belt Mountains. He has hunted there many times before and has never come across another human, most likely due to the rugged country. He contends that you either have to haul everything in yourself or on horseback.  The closest road is a dirt one about 15 miles away.Google earth image of the location:On the morning of November 24, 2012 he came across a track line that he had never seen before.  It was large barefoot prints that went in a single file line diagonally up a hill. He put his 12 inch foot next to it, and it appeared to be 6 -7 inches longer, and twice as wide as his 4 inch width. (See photo)The prints appeared to be a few days old, and although snow melt may make the prints larger than they were originally, they are still very large prints. Not really a believer in the existence of bigfoot, he took only one photo as he tried to figure out what made the track. Each footprint appeared to be about 5 feet apart and he had to leap to the next one as his stride wasn\u0092t even close. It was the last day of Elk hunting and he was mindset on getting one, and continued to hunt without taking more pictures.  As the day progressed he thought more of what he had seen. Having worked with the Department of Fish and Wildlife he was familiar with bear tracks and knew it was not that, nor snow shoes. And figuring the remoteness, it was unlikely it was another hunter.  Also, whoever had made the track would have had to have been a terrific athlete to leap 5 feet, one leg at a time, uphill at an angle at an altitude of 7500 feet.  He then realized that it could possibly be a sasquatch.He now believes there is such a creature, as he has no other explanation of the track ways.  He regrets not taking time to take more photos or measurements and plans to return to the area to look for more evidence.The photo he took, and the description of the track does indeed seem to have all the characteristics of a sasquatch print. Even considering print disintegration with snow melt, I feel this is the track of a very large sasquatch.",
