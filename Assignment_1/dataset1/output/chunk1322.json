            "Observed": "The evening of April 15, 2011 I was with fellow BFRO investigator Eric L. and BFRO enthusiast Sam. We were on a trail in the Shawnee National Forest southeast of Equality, IL.  We were using Sam's thermal imaging monocular (L-3 Comm. X200xp ). We had traveled on the trail up a slight incline and occasionally either doing a howl or some whoops. When we got to our point before we decided to turn back. During our return we started getting some return howls four to be exact over about a five minute period. This was confirmed by several others in our camp. Shortly after, on our way back to base camp, I saw a heat signature. This was rather a bright heat source, different from any of the deer heat source we had observed both before and after this. This \"Heat source\" was behind a tree first observed on the left side of the tree. It then disappeared only to reappear on the right side. This continued for about a minute or so and it was playing \"Peek a Boo\" more or less.",

The seven plus foot tall bipedal figure was attempting to hide behind a tree but portions of it's body were protruding out from behind the tree on both sides.
