            "Follow-Up Report": "Since this incident, the owners of Aqua Barn Ranch have sold much of the acreage. This land is now commercial and residential property. In the seventies it was remote and wooded.I spoke with Kristine on 8/5/02 and reviewed the events as stated above. Kristine gave me the contact information for Jane.I spoke with Jane on 8/15/02: She did not know what Kristine had written and has never seen our website. I asked if she could relay the incident of that summer night and this is her view of events:She was 11 yrs old at the time. She doesn't remember how many kids were at the camp that night, but that there were a lot. It was a clear, warm summer night. She and a few others girls, including Kristine, broke off from the group to talk at least ten feet away from any other kids. The counselors were sleeping on the other side of the camp.The other girls eventually fell asleep after midnight, but Jane remained awake. She was lying on her stomach, with arms under her head. She heard the bushes rustling near her and she froze. Whatever it was stopped at the edge of the clearing and remained there, she could hear slight rustling as if it were shifting weight, and light breathing. She is unsure of the amount of time that had passed when it began to walk towards the group. Jane stated she was petrified. She felt it step on the edge of her sleeping bag as it walked past. Jane was too frightened to call out.Jane remained still. She is unsure when, but at one point she began to hear a very deep cooing sound, not from the ground, but higher up. The sound was near her and another deep cooing responded from across the camp. At this point she knew that there was more than one \"thing\" in the camp. She was perspiring heavily. She heard them rustling around the boxes of supplies..softly, not tearing through them as a bear or raccoon would do.  They continued cooing to each other.  Jane then heard them walking towards her part of the camp again, and then felt something step on her leg. She had been laying with one leg straight and the other bent as usual when she sleeps. When she felt heavy pressure on her leg, she moved her leg and whatever it was stopped.  She is not sure how long it stood there, but it kept its foot on the sleeping bag. Jane stated she was breathing very hard and then felt a large hand press into the center of her back. She recalls that it was as if it was feeling her breathe. Jane believes at this point, she passed out. She remembers nothing more until morning.Jane told the other girls about the evening encounter and remembers telling one counselor, who brushed it off. Jane recalls taking a hayride the following morning with the other kids and upon returning to her cabin, dropping into her bunk from sheer exhaustion. She did not get up for the rest of the day. ",

            "Observed": "I was at our hunting cabin along with my dad, uncle and brother. My brother and I were sitting out in front of our cabin in front of a small campfire. My dad and uncle were inside of the cabin. It was about 10:00 at night and my brother and I heard a noise that neither one of us has ever heard before. We grew up in the country and spent alot of time in the woods, even sleeping out with buddies when we were younger.Whatever it was was in the woods about 30 yards from us and it was screaming loudly and you could hear it breaking pretty good sized limbs. This went on for about 30 seconds or so, long enough for us to hustle to the cabin. I yelled for my dad and he came out on the porch and heard it as well. He said it was something he never heard either. We have combined 70 plus years hunting between us and none of us ever heard anything remotly like this before. It almost seemed like whatever it was was very unhappy that we were there.",

The hunting camp is located 12 miles from Driftwood, outside of Grant.At about 10:30 p.m. the witness and a brother heard a very loud vocalization accompanied by breaking branches and thrashing about 25 yards away from their cabin. This went on for three to four minutes. After the noise and thrashing stopped, they could hear a deep grunting or breathing.The cabin has floodlights that illuminate the yard. The animal stayed in the woods just outside of the illuminated area.The witness heard the noise again at about 3:30 a.m.The next day the witness attempted to check the area from which the vocalization was heard. He found the brush was very thick and overgrown, making passage extremely difficult.",
