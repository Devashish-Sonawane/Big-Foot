            "Observed": "My wife and son and myself were up archery hunting out of Friend Oregon in the Mt Hood National Forest. they had walked up a road to check it out while I waited in the truck for them to return. They soon returned and asked if I had heard a loud whoop type sound. At that time I had not heard anything. They both seemed kind of shaken a bit. I got out of the truck and no sooner got to the back by the tailgate and whatever this was sounded off with a loud whoop sound. We all started walking to the tree line. My son decided to do a whoop sound just goofing off and we got a louder whoop sound back that's where it all started. The whoop sounds got louder in front of us and started from the left, the middle, farther away in the middle and to the right of us. It lasted for several minutes. My wife and son had there phones recording also. We have it recorded. I have been hunting these woods for over 20 years. I know what bear, coyote, cattle, cougars, birds etc sound like. This is not even close of anything I have ever heard. A couple days prior to that my wife mentioned a really foul strong smell. My oldest son said he heard what sounded like someone hitting a tree with a stick like knocks. the video says it all. I also know we were the only people in that area at the time.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone: The witness was out with his wife and son who was on leave from the military. It was earlier that day while hunting uphill that his wife detected a pungent odor. It was there in the same spot when she came back downhill. The son also heard two wood knocks but did not pay much attention to it. Around 7:00 pm on their way back to the truck, the wife and son heard a whoop. They were not sure how far away but it was loud. Then back at the truck they heard another loud whoop. His son walked to the edge of the hill and did a whoop. Five seconds later came a whoop in response. There were whoops from four different locations. One was far away but the others were maybe 100 to 150 yards away. The one coming from the left was where his wife and son had walked out from a blocked off road. It was the loudest. The whoops lasted for fifteen minutes and then just stopped. The area was total silence, not even a sound from a bird. His son yelled again, no response. They are trying to get the recording to me, once received I will update the report accordingly. The witness has hunted this area for twenty years and never heard anything like this. He said the hair on the back of his neck stood up. He did not know if he should be scared or excited. He said his wife had a fearful look. ",
