            "Observed": "Recently at about 4am I was traveling east out of Fort Scott, Kansas. Just over the Missouri border the road gets narrow with heavy forest almost coming up to the edge of it. Ahead of me at the end of my headlights I saw something run across the road on 2 legs. It was covered with thick brown hair and it had to be big because in just 2 or 3 steps it was across the road and gone into the forest on the other side. It wasn't a bear or a farm animal because they run on 4 legs. And it wasn't a man either unless he had never had a shave or a haircut in his life. A man might be able to run fast, but he couldn't possibly have a stride long enough to come out of a forest, cross a road, and disappear again into the forest on the other side in just a couple of seconds. I only got a glimpse of it for just 2 or 3 seconds but I know what I saw and it wasn't like anything I'd ever seen or heard of outside of things associated with Bigfoot.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness by phone. He is a truck driver and lives several states away. During our conversation he appeared to be very sincere in his demeanor and his account was accurate to the written report. Some additional observations were he observed the arms which did not swing forward and back to any great degree and a slightly pointed, cone shape to the head. The most impressive part of the sighting to the witness was it crossed the road in only two or three steps and did it on two legs. The hair on it was a dark brown. The witness was very sure on this point although he only saw it for a short moment of time. He was sure it was not black, but dark brown. I am familiar with this area and just south of the highway about 1/4 mile is a small lake. A stream crosses the highway at this same location. (About 100 miles south of Kansas City and about 70 miles north of the Arkansas state line in Missouri). This is just a few miles west of Nevada Missouri on US-54 where there has been a lot of recent activity.",

We passed each other at the top of the hill and a few seconds later I heard through the woods, maybe 125 yards away, an extremely loud bellowing, kind of like a wounded grizzly, but really really loud, it lasted 10-15 seconds then there was a pretty loud muffled talking for maybe 20-30 seconds more. What I mean by loud muffled talking is it sounded like talking that was loud, but I couldn't understand what was being said, like a different language or something?",
