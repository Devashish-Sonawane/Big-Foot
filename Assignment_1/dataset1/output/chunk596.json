            "Follow-Up Report": "J.C. returned my phone call 1/22/01, at about 9:00pm and we talked over the things left out of his report.There were 4-5 tracks found, going downhill at about a 35-40 degree angle. This hill was a bulldozed area from years past, probably road building involved; it was very hard clay which J.C., at 200lbs., could hardly dent himself. He and a co-hunter were walking by the area when half-heartedly they said look over there... Bigfoot tracks! They weren't really convinced but took a picture of them and continued their hunt. Back down in camp they started wondering about them more and more.They were hunting White Tail and Mule deer. These tracks had around a 36\" stride. They showed a soft heel dug in, not a slide.The picture shows a couple of tracks that appear to be human in basic shape, very little detail from the distance it was taken from. There is no scale but J.C. said they were 17\" long. I asked about other details in the track that are not visible in the photo, like if he saw any toes. He said that he saw a hint of toes and that they seemed to go straight across the track, with very little curve to them.Normally with so little to go on and not seeing these myself (in person), I would be reluctant to just come out and call them Sasquatch tracks. But this is a possibility and could add a little data to the overall picture unfolding. If it is something else like mistaken ID or an outright hoax, then it too would add some data that might help unravel this mystery.J.C. and company have hunted all their lives and became quite perturbed with these tracks, which were not from an animal known to them.Without actually seeing these tracks in person, this is the best assessment I can make. Far worse have made it into print before. I do have the picture of them and they are interesting and appear to have been made from something large and bipedal.",
