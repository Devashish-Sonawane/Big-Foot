            "Observed": "My girlfriend and I were on vacation in Blue Ridge, GA. We went hiking the day before and the ground was frozen solid from the weather. The following day we went hiking and it rained the night before. It was very cloudy all day and still pretty cold but the ground was thawing out. We decided to hike the Benton-MacKaye Trail off Highway 515. We started at 8:45 a.m. and followed the trail around to an open field and decided to take a quick break. While on  the break, I yelled as loud as I could twice and the echo was impressive. We continued following the trail for another 1 1/2 hours until we decided to head back. On the way back around the field, we noticed a huge footprint. It was obvious it was a footprint because you could see the toes in the clay. The clay wasn't hard nor was it wet and slick. We passed it on the way and had no walking troubles or saw the print. There were footprints around other than ours, however, we didn't see anybody from the start of the trailhead and throughout the hike.  We looked around for more and discovered 4-5 more tracks the same size, others that looked similar but less defined. It was a very deep print, looked to have 4 toes. It seemed to be walking down the hill towards the creek.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone, and he seemed honest and sincere. The Benton MacKaye Trail is a nearly 300 mile footpath that winds through scattered homesteads, farms, and rambling creeks. It used to merge with an original portion of the Appalachian Trail before it was shortened in 1957.   With the witness' excellent description of the area, and as I only livea few minutes from the trailhead, I was able to find the exact spot. The prints were still visible after 5 days, though 3 were partially in vegetation and wouldn't cast good. I decided to cast the third of the total of 4. The strides were roughly 32\", 37\", 41\"and 46\", as I could not make out the full, exact, print size of the rest.  The maker was headed down hill. The clay was on the trail between two large fields. There were boot prints about the area, but the footprints in question were just off center in softer red clay where a hiker would avoid. We could see only 4 toes in all prints where any were visible. The witness stated that while he and his girlfriend were examining the prints, a loud crash was heard up on the ridge overlooking them. He said it could have been a rotten tree falling. The witness made a \"whoop\" to see if he could get any response, but they heard nothing else. I've included pictures of the footprint cast:",

            "Observed": "I was hiking, with my dog, at Wallace Falls State Park on 4/26/11. I started the hike at about 11:30am and there were only two other vehicles in the entire parking lot. I had hiked passed the upper portion of the falls, following an old logging road up to Wallace Lake. I only saw one other hiker coming down from the falls lookout. At approximately 2pm, my dog and I were walking towards the lake (it was about 1.5 miles away). We heard a very strange, humanoid yell come from across a marshy bog area. We both were taken by surprise and stopped. I looked across the bog area up towards the thick forest on the other side (about 75 yards away). I couldnt see any clothing of a hiker or potential body of a humanoid creature. The sound however was very interesting. I've spent many hours hiking the Washington state forests. I know what certain animals sound like when calling for a mate or calling to signal a warning. This noise was different. It was comparable to a person yelling directly and loudly \"yoouuuuuu!!!\". My dog and I stopped dead in our tracks and listened. About a minute went by and I heard the same noise again from the same area. The loud and direct \"yooouuuuu!!\". It was very strange. I'm positive that whatever made the noise was either a human toying with me, or some humanoid creature warning me of its presence. Being miles up alone in the wilderness, I didn't want to John Wayne across a bog into thick brush to investigate. It was the first time I've ever heard such a unique sound while out in the forest. I will never forget the look of confusion on my dog's face either. I'm sure mine looked the same as well.",
