            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length and he seemed very credible.  A few things to note that were not in the initial report, were the detailed descriptions of the animal.  The witness stated that he was driving a Nissan pickup and the animal was about 4 feet higher than his truck.  The animal was on the left hand side of the road standing directly on the white line of the highway.  He slowed down both because he thought it was a stranded person and because of the dangerous curve on the road.  It was at the bottom of a steep valley with a hard curve over a culvert and creek bed.  He stated that the animal was pure black with coarse hair.  He did not get a good look at his face because it was mostly a side profile in his high beams.  He repeated several times that the arm length was extraordinary.  Even though it was a full moon, he said that the bottom of the valley was dark.  The valley is full of Ponderosa pine trees.  The vehicle behind him was estimated to be a half of a mile back.  The highway was actually on Nebraska Highway 2, not 385.  Highway 2 and 385 merge together, but not for a few more miles South.",
