            "Follow-Up Report": "Alejo is retired. He had a long career as a state prison guard at the Southern New Mexico Correction Facility in Las Cruces, New Mexico.My conversation with him established a few important things, with respect to his reliability as an observer in this situaton:- Alejo has hunted in New Mexico's Sacramento Mountains since his youth. He has seen black bears several times while hunting. He would not have misinterpreted a black bear in this scenario.- During his 20 years as a state prison guard he has spent a lot of time closely watching big, bad, buff guys.  The figure he saw in the mountains was much bigger than any prison inmate he has even seen.I asked Alejo if anything else stood out in his memory about the figure. He said it had very dark fur covering its whole body.I asked if the figure was walking in the shade, or was possibly a silhouette from his angle of view, which might have made the fur appear darker than it actually was. Alejo was certain about the fur color, because the figure had walked across a small meadow, in direct, overhead sunlight.  It was out in the open, at a distance of 50 yards or so. It didn't seem to notice Alejo, or at least didn't make eye contact, and it wasn't in a hurry.-------------------------------------------------------There are two BFRO expeditions are headed to this area in the last week of 2004 and the first week of 2005.  There are unsually good odds for seeing and photographing in this region, at this time of year, due to the peculiarities of the terrain, and the access and support we are receiving from the local people.See photos of the region on the page for the upcoming expeditions. Click here for that page.These are open-invitation expeditions for people who would like to join the BFRO. Participants must be experienced campers and be prepared for any weather conditions.At this time there are no remaining slots for the first expedition, but you are invited to inquire about remaing slots for the second expedition.  To inquire, call (949) 278-6403.",

The temperature was approximately 52 degrees and the day was overcast. At around 3 PM the three of us struck out from our campsite directly into the timber. There was no overgrowth and the trees were still bare. This is the reason we didn\u0092t take any of the marked trails in the area. The terrain is very rocky and over the next hour we hiked and climbed. Circling back into the camp area we emerged at the far end and headed toward the road that runs the length of the campsite.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness and his wife on March 10th 2012 at the location of the sighting. Both were very credible and I found no reason for them to be making this up. The wife did not see the Sasquatch as she stayed back at camp. She said she believed her husband because he does not scare easily and his face was white when he came back into camp to tell her of the encounter. It is important to note they were camping at the location the night before and were cooking on an open fire ring. Also during the day of the sighting the wife pointed out that the two boys were breaking fallen tree limbs against the trunks of trees and having play sword fights. The Sasquatch most likely was drawn in by the scents of food being cooked and the wood knocking the boys made during play, then followed the witness and his boys during their hike, emerging onto the trail as the witness and the boys made it to the parking area. We hiked the trail where the witness had seen the Sasquatch. On the way back I had the witness take photos of me using my hands for scale as a comparison to the Sasquatch.The animal seen was 7.5' to 8' feet tall and much wider than me. I stayed after the witness and his wife left and tried some wood knocking and calls but did not receive any responses.",
