A part-time rig hand with me in the truck also witnessed the creature. The following day we found several partial footprints along the creek bank on the West side of the road. We lost the tracks after 10-15 yards in the dense undergrowth.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This report was originally submitted to the Texas Bigfoot Research Center.I spoke to both witnesses involved in this encounter at separate times. I found both men to be very credible and they were both seemingly honest and factual in their account of the event. The witness who submitted the report had actually had a previous encounter in the state of Nebraska back in the 1970's (see Report #1379). Even so, the encounter he had in Oklahoma was no less spectacular to him, even though it was at a greater distance and for a shorter period of time. Both witnesses described the encounter as lasting only \"two or three seconds.\" They both described the animal as coming out of a ditch, quickly crossing the road, and disappearing into a creek bed. Later, at the area of the crossing, they looked for tracks. They saw where the animal had gone into the bed and left some tracks, albeit not totally distinguishable. Both men dismissed the possibility that the animal was human, coyote, cow, bobcat, dog, etc. Both men said that if they had to choose an animal, Bigfoot would be the creature that they saw that day. \u00a9Copyright 1999-2004 Texas Bigfoot Research Center",
