            "Observed": "Back in 1982 a friend, his brother and I was fishing along the White River about 4 miles north of Stinesville. We had been there many times before. That day I happend to mention that there was no birds singing or had noticed any game there.After a few minutes my buddy said that he hasnt seen any either. He did say he had a feeling of being watched ,and his brother had said the same thing.After awhile of looking around while we fished I looked up on this tall ridge behind us about 50 to 75 yards behind us I thought I saw\"someone\" watching us.I pointed it to my buddys and they saw it to. I have lived in the country all my life, hunted day and night, still I never felt this way before. We watched each other for a long time, it moving so carefully trying to get a better look  .After 45 minutes or so we thought it best we leave so we started back to my truck and \"it\" followed us from a distance never getting out in the open but not really trying to hide that well either. we also noticed a faint smell of something dead or so we thought.We made it to my truck and didnt take too much time loading it, after all we walked about a mile and was ready to leave. We still tell this story today and not sure what it was but \"Bigfoot\" has been mentioned not disputed by my buddys or I.",
