I came around a turn and he/she came walking out of the woods, he walked up over the bank, took about 3 steps and walked up the other side of the bank, when he crossed the road he turned his head and looked at me and kept walking. He was reddish brown with long arms.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met at this location and spoke with the witness at length. She stated, \"I will never forget what I saw and it was no bear!\" The witness is a hunter who has seen a lot of bears and is certain this was not a bear crossing in front of her. I, myself, attempted to cross the road at the same spot, in the same manner as the creature had done. At 6'1\" I have a pretty long stride but my best effort still took me six steps to reach the same point. I asked her to stand about where her vehicle would have been when she came around the turn and saw it crossing the road. She estimated it to be between seven to eight feet tall based on my size in comparison. She also told me it was much \"bulkier\" than myself. This section of unmarked road is around one eighth of a mile from a blind curve to a blind hill. Anything crossing here could quickly be out of sight before a vehicle coming around the turn or topping the hill would be in view. This area of the county is appropriately named \"Deer Run\" as the deer are plentiful. It is sparsely populated with the majority of it farm land. However, there is still plenty of cover along the ridge lines and forest areas. There was a possible sighting along with vocalizations only several miles from this location in 2012, see Report #37565. ",

Then we heard it moan again, and we heard it begin to run towards us on two feet.  We jumped back from the fire and turned on the lights on the truck. As the lights shined down the hollow that night, I saw something I hope to never see again.  It was around 6 feet tall, long arms, and dark hair covered its body.  We were about 20 yards from it.  I looked at it for about 10 more seconds before we jumped in the truck and drove off as fast as we could.  I can assure you that this is no hoax.  Promise to God.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to one of the witnesses and his mother about the incident.  I found him to be credible and found his mother to be supportive of him and credible as well.  The witness and two others were \u0093down at the pond\u0094 in the woods about one mile from the witness\u0092s house.  The young men were camping and enjoying the great outdoors that Tennessee has to offer.  It was a clear night, and the young men were preparing hot dogs.  One of the witnesses had driven his truck to the campsite and had parked it \u0093on the ridge.\u0094  The witness stated that a very loud, \u0093moaning yell\u0094 resonated through the woods and the young men were immediately overcome with fear.  Shortly thereafter (a few seconds perhaps), the same yell was heard again.  This time, however, the yell was followed by the sounds of fast approaching bipedal footsteps.  The witnesses were shocked and quickly ran to the truck.  They turned on the vehicle\u0092s headlights and illuminated the hollow below.  There, to the witnesses\u0092 amazement, about twenty yards away, was a \u0093hairy thing\u0094 standing approximately six feet in height.  The only other details the witness was able to provide indicated \u0093long arms\u0094 and \u0093dark hair.\u0094 The witness said that he was so frightened that he recalls no facial details whatsoever.  He said he is absolutely certain that \u0093no human in a costume\u0094 was there that night, and that it was certainly no animal with which he or his companions were remotely familiar.  The young men hurriedly left the campsite and the creature behind.I also spoke to the witness\u0092s mother who described the event from her perspective.  She said that the witnesses rushed into the house in near panic-stricken state and that their faces \u0093were white as snow.\u0094  The mother believed the young men and soon (on a later date) she experienced the same sound coming from the woods.  She said that whatever the witnesses saw that night \u0093scared the wits out of them.\u0094  Further, she added that now she and \u0093the boys\u0094, who are \u0093big boys over six feet tall,\u0094 are afraid to go into the woods \u0096 period.As I am able to speak to the other witnesses, I will also add their testimony to this report.
