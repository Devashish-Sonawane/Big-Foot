            "Observed": "During an expedition in the western foothills adjacent to Mt St Helens, two men from our group spotted themselves in a trail depression approximately 100 yards from, and looking down our location, planning to utilize the FLIR from that vantage point to observe myself and another man who planned to spend a few hours in darkness in a known \u0093hotspot\u0094 deep in these woods.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness, his friend, and the other two gentlemen in the remote FLIR post location were all attending the WA 2 Expedition along with myself as host, for the BFRO in mid-August 2014.He provided a very detailed written description of the events, and his partner corroborated the testimony by describing the encounter in detail as well.It appeared that the subject approached the two men very low to the ground, since both men described seeing the finger, complete with knuckles illuminated by the red \"ball\" of light at a height of not much more than 14 inches. The moon had not risen at that time, and the location is very densely forested by 100-150 ft Douglas Fir trees with thick canopy overhead. This absolute darkness would have enhanced the two witnesses' ability to see the light anomaly.I interviewed the two men in the \"FLIR post\" and while they were equipped with a thermal imaging device, they did not observe any heat signatures that would confirm a very large, warm-blooded mammal in the vicinity - except for the witness and his companion who were being observed from a distance by the other two men with the FLIR imager. After much discussion on this lack of thermal signature, we hypothesized that the subject may have spent the entire duration of the encounter either flat, or very low to the ground.  This location is considered a \"hot spot\" by many enthusiasts and has a history of class A sightings. (see reports # 35812, # 22475).There were also two tree fall events in addition to the event described in this report, both during twilight hours during the expedition and both within a 3/4 mile radius of this encounter location.After the encounter the next morning, I questioned the men extensively with regard to what they saw and heard. They did not detect any noticeable odor, or made no mention of vocalizations or utterances made by this subject.The pictures below provide some daylight representation of the encounter site:This picture depicts the vantage point seen by the two men in the \"FLIR post\"The men in the FLIR post believe the subject was lying and moving while flat on the ground and this log obstructed their ability to view the thermal signature via the FLIR camera:Vantage point of eye-witness while viewing the \"silver dollar size red ball of light\":The witnesses believe this to be a possible footprint or knee impression about 12-14\" by 6\":Based on eye-witness testimony of the two men and other ancillary and circumstantial evidence, I believe there is a very high likelihood that both men encountered a Sasquatch in close proximity to their position in this dense forest that night.",
