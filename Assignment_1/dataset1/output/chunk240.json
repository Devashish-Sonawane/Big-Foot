It was about 7:30am and I was waiting for the bus stop (we lived on the corner of a dead end road at the top of a hill across the road was nothing but woods and logging roads. If you keep going straight it goes downhill on a gravel road and there were two trailers back there at the top of the hill. Our creek ran under the road at the bottom). I was waiting for the bus and was looking down the gravel road because there was light and I was a little nervous waiting and I saw something cross the road in one step where the creek runs under the road. The road is big enough for two cars to pass by each other. Whatever it was big and, no, it wasn't a bear; I had seen bears in zoos before and it wasn't any animal that I had seen before.",
