            "Follow-Up Report": "I had the opportunity to do a site visit and spend approximately 7 hours with the homeowner, hiking, researching and exploring. He and his wife were very gracious, open and sincere.They live in a small rural town in South Central NH and live on a dirt road with few neighbors near a State Forest. The area boasts mixed hardwood and softwood forests as well as many swamps and ponds. There is abundant wildlife in the area including black bear, deer, moose, mountain lion, coyote and other animals as well as many types of birds. The gentleman who made the report is a self employed Engineer who works in the Nuclear Medicine field and his wife is a school teacher.Over the last few years unusual things have been happening on and around their property. Individually they did not seem significant but once the homeowner added them together he started to wonder if they could be experiencing Sasquatch activity.My visit started with a stop at his barn which he uses as a machine shop and shipping and receiving area. It is approximately 100+ yards away from his house going down the street. Just days before my visit something or someone left him a pile of white medium sized rocks with a small plastic butterfly along with 3 small plastic ornamental leaves and a small figurine. These were found behind the barn on a path that leads to his home. He asked his wife and granddaughter (16 years old) if either one of them had anything to do with the mystery arrangement, neither knew what he was talking about. The other thing that made him a little nervous was that a similar pile of rocks was left at the spot on the side of a pond about a mile away in the state forest where he goes to meditate. I was able to observe and photograph both piles. He also noted that the security light near the back door of his barn by the loading dock had been swatted by something breaking it. There would be no reason for anyone to be behind his barn, the light itself is close to 8 feet off the ground. Walking to the house we stopped at the patch of Hemlock trees where he experienced the nauseating wet dog smell. The trees are very close to the road and could hide a bear or another creature easily under the cover of darkness with easy access to retreat into the forest behind his barn.On the way to the orchard we stopped in their front yard and I was shown where their house had been struck by a rock one night during foggy /inclement weather. The land slopes down and away from the front of the house into the forest. A person or creature could easily duck and hide and not be seen as well as throw an object from behind any number of natural obstructions. I did like the bears scratching a stump at the base of their woods line. Our next stop was his orchard where he showed me his pear tree that had been pillaged the year before of all its fruit. This occurrence puzzled him. He showed me where branches had been broken about 8 feet off the ground where something was getting at the fruit at the top of the tree. Generally the animals when they eat their fruit will leave half eaten pieces on the ground surrounding the fruit trees. He feels it is unlikely that a person would come onto the back of their property in the middle of the night to take all of their fruit. Their home is very secluded and there are no street lights in the area.Past the orchard is the forest where he and his family have heard unusual screaming that they describe as if it were a woman. Generally they hear this screaming late at night or early in the morning, often accompanied by coyote calls shortly after. They have no idea what could be making these screams but mentioned that they do have mountain lions that are in the area. I suggested that he invest in a recording device to try to capture these sounds for identification. We then hiked into the State Forest where he had heard the wood knocks. The area was quite beautiful with mixed forest and swamps. We did a couple of wood knocks but had no response. We did not see any other hikers in the area.I was brought me to the river next. We stopped by where he sighted the mystery creature from his car as he drove to an appointment. He described it as being on all fours with 4\u0094 long cinnamon colored fur. The area abuts state forest lands and the river is quite shallow and rocky in this area. He speculated that whatever was in the river was fishing as the state does stock the river with fish. He regrets not stopping that day for a positive ID on the creature he saw as overhanging branches did block his view of the creatures head. Once done we went and hiked Temple Mountain. It is in an area where other reported sightings have occurred. Unfortunately we had to cut our hike short due to a thunder storm that was approaching.He recently contacted me and reported that something opened their shed and removed a container of chicken feed. He found the container in the woods. Something/someone dumped some feed out onto the ground and left the rest in the container. The odd thing is that in order to get into the shed someone or something had to remove a 2x4 from a bracket that secures the door shut that is 4\u0092 off the ground. He did find this to be quite strange.    ",
