            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted him by telephone on 07-26-00He had difficulty remembering the exact location, but I was able to piece it together from his landmarks, and quite a bit of questioning.His encounter appeared to have taken place in the south side of the F.K. Lane Grove Trail of Humboldt Redwoods State Park, along the Avenue of the Giants, just north of the small town of Philipsville.The Franklin K. Lane Grove (dedicated in 1928 to honor the former secretary of the Interior) consists of approximately 193 acres of ancient old growth redwoods. The grove is surrounded by many acres of undeveloped private and timber lands. The sighting location is in the very southern end of the 53,000 acre park.*Encounter took place on April 8 1991, at approx. 2:00 p.m..* claimed to have first heard the snapping of branches approx. 200 yards up the trail.*first heard the calls/screams approximately 200 yards away, beyond where they had stopped.*What ever made the sounds had gotten within approx. 100 yards of them.*screams lasted about 45 seconds.* found it difficult to gauge the distance of the howling, but said it closed the distance on them very quickly. He said \"it sounded like a Howler Monkey, but deeper! similar to an elk bugle!\"*Heard screams over the near by engine sounds (chainsaw or motorcycle). a motocross track is located nearby.",
