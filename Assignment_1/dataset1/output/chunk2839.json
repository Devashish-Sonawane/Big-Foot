            "Observed": "We were racoon hunting we had turned our dogs out and let them get a head start on us...we gave them a half-hour or so to let them get far enough ahead of us..we then got in the truck and started out the road, you can only drive about 10 miles in a truck untill the road becomes too narrow to pass, we got to where we had to turn the truck. (there were 8 of us in the truck 3 in the cab and 5 in the bed)  We called the dogs but got no response, so we waited...about 30 to 45 mins later the dogs came running back to the truck with their tails tucked between their legs like sometings had scared them to death. Now we didn't think anything about this, passing it off as a bobcat that had spooked the dogs..we loaded the dogs into the truck and started back out of the mountain.  We had only made it about 100 to 200 feet when the driver of the truck slammed on the brakes ( we weren't going fast ) I was in the back of the truck not knowing what was going on..I looked into the back glass and saw the 3 in the front of the truck pointing up ahead of us so we ( the people in the back ) stood up and looked, what we saw was huge, standing about 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall, the color was hard to tell with the shadows but I would say it was either black or dark brown.  After about ten seconds the driver put the truck in reverse and backed up 50 feet or so..we all got out of truck and asked one another if we had all saw it..we all did, but we werent sure what we had saw, some said a bear, some said 'bigfoot'.  after about 10 mins. of talking about it we got back into the truck and drove back to where it had stood.  We got out of the truck and walked up to where we had saw it.",

KY...near a lake on an old dirt road, he said he saw two eyes and thought it was an opossum so he slowed his car and aimed his lights at the eyes think that it was a 'possum it would play dead and not move when the lights hit it. To his suprise it was no possum. The lady he had with him went crazy, screaming and crying..what he said he say was not the same color as what we say he said it was a grey color.  He said when the lights hit it that it slowly turned it's body keeping its head looking back at the car and walked into the woods.",
