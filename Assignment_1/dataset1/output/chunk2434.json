            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the primary witness, Daniel Long, by phone. He is now 28 years old and now lives in North Carolina. He grew up in the area where the incidents occurred. At the time he was a teenager and so were the other witnesses. Note: Most rural teenagers did not have smartphones in 2009. They didn't carry cameras like they all do today.His grandfather still lives at the West Virginia property and can provide access to BFRO investigators. Daniel is able to contact the other witnesses who were with him at the time.Notes from our conversation:When the six of them saw the bigfoot walking away from them over the ridge it was approximately 40 yards away. It was fleeing them. That visual incident didn't last nearly as long as the visual incident during the prior weekend. The two witnesses that day, Daniel and Corey, were looking down from the ridge. The figure was 50 yards at the closest point. They watched it walking for about 100 yards until it was out of their view.  When they returned the following weekend the purpose was to show their friends. Taking photos wasn't as important as simply showing it to their friends.  Today it would be different. Don't make assumptions about what should have occurred with some rural teens in 2009, and what they should have been carrying with them.",
