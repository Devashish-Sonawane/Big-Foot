            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness at length about his experiences, and decided to separate his 'older' experiences into a new report (see  report #25793).  The moans were fairly close to them, within 300 yards.  He seemed to think the moans were from one individual.As the creature moved through the forest, he noticed the trees shaking, and it was about 100 feet away from them at the closest point.  The thick brush area that the creature ran into was about 70 feet away.  The only thing he noticed after it moved into this spot was possibly a head pop up, then down very quickly.The witness states that some of the neighborhood residents refer to there being a \"troll' in the neighborhood.  He couldn't add much detail to this description, for none was ever given to him by anyone.  Its possible that other sightings have occurred in this area, with the witnesses choosing to not look into it further.After speaking to the witness about his experiences, I believe him to be truthful and sincere.",
