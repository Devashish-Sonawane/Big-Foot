Time of day was about 11AM, weather conditions were clear and sunny with a light breeze. \u0095 Odor was described as a \u0093wet dog with body odor\u0094 and unlike anything either had ever smelled before.\u0095 Knocks heard by Mr. B came from a wooded area approximately fifty yards from his position. There were five to six loud raps, in fairly rapid succession.\u0095 Mrs. B tripped over a rock as they were returning to their vehicle. When Mr. B looked down to see what she had tripped on he noticed the first footprint. After a brief examination of the area another less prominent print was found.\u0095 Mr. B placed his foot next to the clearest of the prints in order to gauge its size. He later measured his boot to arrive at the estimated dimensions. \u0095 Depth of the prints was approximately one half inch, in very firm soil. The weight of the witnesses was not enough to create a track in the surrounding area.\u0095 They estimated the prints to be one or two days old due to the debris (pine needles, leaves, etc.) present in them.\u0095 There was one right and one left print, with five toes clearly visible. Stride length was over five feet.\u0095 Mr. B noticed that the forest was unusually quiet on this particular morning.This location is approximately four miles from Report #9018 and has abundant water sources. It is also home to a large population of elk, deer, and other game animals.",
