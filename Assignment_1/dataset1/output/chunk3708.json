            "Observed": "We had been fishing in the river, standing on sand banks. My companion and I had our dog and he decided to walk South in the river to fish downstream. I continued to fish standing in knee deep water on the East side of the river. It was hot, very hot weather. I heard sounds of deep heavy breathing...a weird sound I cannot really articulate, but it caused me to look up and around. I thought my dog (a Great Dane) who had followed my companion downstream was back panting heavily from running in the river. I realized the sound was coming from behind me. I turned around and saw a tall creature staring at me. I couldn't believe my what I was seeing. He was 100-150 feet West of me standing on the bank beside a tree. I could see his eyes very clearly. They were like a man's. He had hair around him and covering his face and his entire body. He was very tall at least 7 feet and built very athletically. We just stared at each other for several minutes. I had no weapon to protect myself so I just stood very still and so did he. I realized I had to do something. I dropped my fishing pole in the water and started to move sideways slowly downstream where I could barely see the person I had come with. As I did the creature moved very quickily to the next tree Northward, stopped and stared at me. I stopped. I wanted to move closer, but I was too scared. I thought, if I had a gun or something I would move toward it, but then it occurred to me this may be somebody in a suit! I thought it might be my brother. But, in this hot weather? I called out my brother's name, \"is that you? Quit kidding around!\" The creature simply stared at me. We were both curious about each other and I could tell, I don't know how that it was a male creature. Several more minutes passed and I knew I better get out of there. I moved slowly again, sideways and began softly calling to my companion, but he was so far downstream he couldn't hear me. I was afraid now, so I started moving faster to get out of there. The creature moved when I did and he move away from tree to tree and I made my way through the river to my companion. I yelled for him to get up here and told him what I saw. He thought I was crazy. When I finally got him up river to see, the creature was gone. We went up on the bank to look for prints, but I didn't see any, because it was all dry sandy soil.",

            "Observed": "I lived in Mississippi when I was a child. I was about six years old when this occurred. I was asleep in my bedroom one night on the second floor of our home when the neighbor's dog began barking wildly at something in the yard. It made such   that my siblings and I finally got out of bed to see what the commotion was all about. Looking down from our window we saw something in the garden which was right next to the house. There was only natural light, but the thing was only about twenty or thirty feet away and I can still remember it vividly. It was squatting down eating the vegetables from the plants there. I could even hear it eating from where I stood. A moment later we all screamed in surprise and shock at what we saw. It looked up  at us and kept right on eating. I remember that, by its mannerism, it had no fear of us what-so-ever and made no attempt to leave the area or hide in any way. What I remember was a creature that was built like a human being. I can't say exactly  how big it was, but I know it was bigger than the average person. It was covered all over with dark, shaggy, brown hair and when it  looked up at us as we stood in the window its eyes glowed white in the darkness. Eventually my Grandfather woke up and saw it,  too. He went out the side door with his gun and fired up into the air. We continued to watch out of the window and then saw the creature stand up and run off on two legs into the woods toward the river. I remember it ran so fast that I could hardly believe  it. The next morning we found very large human-like footprints in the garden. I had never seen anything like that before and never  have since.",
