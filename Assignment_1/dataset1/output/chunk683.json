            "Follow-Up Report": "Upon speaking with the witness he was able to add the following details of the encounter not previously noted. The SUV was parked in the garage with the rear of the vehicle at the entrance of the garage. The witness saw the back upper torso, shoulders, and head of the creature. This entire time of observation was five seconds from a distance of approximately twenty five feet. There was no description of arms, lower torso, and legs as they were blocked from view by the vehicle. During this encounter there was a light on in the garage that allowed the witness to notice this detail. However, no face detail was noted, other than the absence of visible ears, because the animal was observed from behind. The witness estimates the height of his SUV at around six foot six inches. The creature in question would have been over a foot taller than the top of the SUV according to witness observation, placing the animal at around eight foot tall. As stated, after about five seconds of observation the witness ran inside.After returning outside with his son the witness noticed three footprints left on his concrete drive due to the animal walking onto the driveway from the wet grass caused by the evening rain. He describes them as looking like a man\u0092s footprint. The witness is fortunate enough to own a shoe once worn by an NBA player. The shoe in question is a size sixteen and the witness states the wet footprint wouldn\u0092t fit into the shoe. He said the width of the print stood out as being wider than the foot that would have been in the size sixteen shoes.  He also estimates the distance between the footprints at around four feet with the total distance covered in three steps at just over twelve feet.  The area around the witness\u0092 property is wooded with intermittent farms and fields. The animal would have had to cover an area of around seventy-five yards in order to reach the wood line from where the witness observed the creature.  According to the witness he was in the house about thirty seconds.I found this witness to be articulate and forthcoming and believe he is credible.  In my opinion there is land nearby that would support such animals and there is an abundance of game in the area.  The land I reference is Ft. Rucker which is where the Army trains Helicoptor pilots and hunting is off limits on this base.  ",

            "Observed": "The first incident happened in the Fall of 1998. The witnesses were sleeping, around 10 PM, when they were awakened by 2 loud vocalizations. The first was more of a loud growl, the second started low and progressed to higher pitches and sounded like a scream. The witnesses related that it sounded as if what ever made the sounds was standing in the room with them, it was so loud. They said you could feel it. The husband got up to investigate but found nothing. He said that his 2 dogs were very scared, they would not move from where they were laying in the house. The husband stated that \" I couldn't have pryed them off the floor with a spatula.\" The second incident occured in October of 1999. The wife let their dogs out that morning. The dog involved did not return as she usually does, so the wife went out to look for her. At the bottom of the front steps she found the dog bleeding from the stomach area. The wife took the mixed breed dog to the vet. The vet stated that the dog had been hit by something big, such as a car or something. The witnesses said that this dog never went to the street, which was approx. 200 yards from the house. The dog weighed approx. 25 pounds. The injuries included massive internal injuries and a 1 1/2 inch cut on her stomach.The vet said it was a puncture wound of some sort and also the dog's rib was broken. Unfortunetly, the dog died. The witness believes that the dog walked up on a Bigfoot and was kicked by the creature. The cut on her stomach could have been where it's toenail had cut her.",
