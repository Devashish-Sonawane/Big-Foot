            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness to this encounter now lives in another state, but spoke in great detail as he described the encounter he had while training in the military at Fort Stewart.  I can add the following details to his report after talking to him:The being had long, reddish-colored hair that appeared around four inches long, and matted.  It moved on two legs, and had arms that were longer than a man's, that came about to the animal's knees.  It moved off in a slow jog, taking what the witness described as \"twice the normal step a man would take\" as it headed for the treeline.The animal emitted what the witness described as \"a low, feel-it type of growl\", which lasted close to thirty seconds.The witness reported that he believed  the animal's height to be between seven to eight feet tall, when he compared it at the time  to nearby trees.Additionally, the witness stated that back at camp that night he kept hearing activity coming from the woods that surrounded the camp.  He heard sticks breaking, wood-on-wood sounds, something splashing in water, and what sounded like footsteps coming from the woods--first on one side of the camp, then the other.  The noises lasted for four to five hours.The witness told me that when he considers what it was he believes he saw, he could not see a man being that tall or moving that quickly, and that the only thing he could think of that it could be, was a bigfoot.",
