One day, lost to memory, they hiked about 2 miles above the lake, off the eastern side trail and, reaching a small meadow area with a 200 foot ledge overlooking the lake, they decided to roll large 2-man boulders over the ledge, into the lake. It made quite a racket going down the hill and when they hit the water it sounded like explosives going off.",
