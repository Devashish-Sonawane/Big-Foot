            "Also Noticed": "Two mornings after my sighting, we had started out in 2 trucks for our day hunt, it was way dark and cold...snowing slightly. It was still very dark, and as we slowly drove up this old logging road, we saw something \u0093crawl\u0094 across the road about 100-150ft ahead of us. At first I thought it looked like a tree sloth, or a wounded bear. It was hard to tell in the darkness, but you could see a dark figure moving slowly across the snow-covered road. Everyone in the truck saw it, and we stopped where we saw it enter the heavy growth to the left of the road. This was a steep embankment heavily overgrown with trees, etc. Well, after we stopped, no one had the guts to get out and see what it was.  One guy got out with a .45 auto and a flashlight and slid down over the embankment. He scampers back about 3 minutes later in a big hurry. No shots fired, his eyes big and his face white.  He said that we should get out of there because the thing he saw could be dangerous.  He said it was big and covered with hair.  It looked like it was trying to hide under some branches.  He said he saw a face glance at him as it was walking away and he said he thought it was a hunter wearing a brown fur coat and was on horseback, because \u0093he was much too tall to be walking\u0094\u0085 yet he saw no horse.",

We had stopped our trucks on a dirt road on our way back to camp following our morning hunt to \u0093work\u0094 these hillsides that converged at a stream near the road. To our knowledge, there were no other hunters in that area. Four of us went up into the hills to make a giant circle to try to scare up some game and drive them back down towards the stream where the others were waiting.",

The following details can be added to the report:--Witness did not look for nor see any tracks from the sighting on the ridge.--The creature may have been crawling across the road because it was injured or because it was in distress by the presence of the vehicles.  Or, it could have been trying not to be seen as it was a dark object up against the white snow on the ground.",
