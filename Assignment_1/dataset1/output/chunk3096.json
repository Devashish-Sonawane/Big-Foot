            "Observed": "I was driving down Ohio Route 325 in Gallia County on Saturday, January 21, 2017 between 9:30-10:00 pm. I came around a curve and saw a reflection off the eyes of a deer. I slowed down and noticed several of them in a field right next to the road. By this time, I was completely stopped because I was counting the deer. While counting the deer, I saw what looked like a bigfoot near one of the deer. It must have known I saw it because it started running away towards the treeline. It was way taller than the deer and was a light to medium brown. It had a huge upper body. It didn't run with a very smooth gait.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness and his wife at the place of his sighting on State Route 325 a few miles northeast of the intersection with U.S. Rte. 35 in Rio Grande. In addition to the information listed in his report, he described the bigfoot as being a light to medium brown color, having brownish-black skin, deep-set eyes and a broad, flattish nose. The witness was about 25 foot \u0096 35 foot away from the creature. The creature was apparently standing among the deer. When it took off, it didn't run with a smooth gait, as if something may have been wrong with its leg.In checking the weather history for that night, I found it was 51\u00b0, the wind was calm and there was a waxing crescent moon.  In observing the area, I could find no obvious tracks or other evidence. There did appear to be a worn trail where the witness said the creature ran. The area is heavily wooded with small streams, lakes and ponds. The woods where the creature ran towards is posted with \u0093No Trespassing\u0094 signs. There is a house almost directly across the road. ",

I was about a half a mile from where I parked my vehicle walking on an ATV trail. It was still mostly dark and I had my flashlight in my hand but turned off. I was trying to be quiet as possible while walking quickly because I wanted to make good time to a favorite clearing without spooking any deer that may be in the area.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness. Our conversations were by email and by phone. I found him to be articulate and able to recall the events of the day without hesitation. As he recalled his encounter, he admitted to having \"Goose Bumps\" as he told me what happened. After much questioning, I am able to add the following to his encounter in his own words:    \"The ambient light was very low and the only way I even saw it was because I was walking slightly uphill on a ridge and I noticed something very large moving against the clouds. When I turned on the flashlight it was wet with dark brown almost black fur. When it walked, it's legs were bent, torso was slightly hunched over and its body seemed to kind of glide and didn't bounce like people do. Its arms were long, to the side of its body and swung like a person.  I don't really remember what its hands looked like sorry. I have no idea if it was male or female or how old it was. It was just big and muscular with a big rear end. Its head looked like it was sitting almost directly on it's shoulders. I want to say its head looked pointy but I'm not positive.There is one more thing that I'd like to add that I forgot to say. I had a camera with me but the encounter was so short lived that even if I had remembered the camera, there is no way I could have taken a picture. I use to think with all the digital cameras out there that Sasquatch couldn't exist because there would be tons of pictures but now I can see why that isn't true.\"The witness stated to me he watched the Bigfoot cover 25 or so yards in less that 5 seconds but noted it didn't seem to be in a hurry. He was an avid non-believer prior to this encounter,having spent a great deal of time in the woods and not had any similar experiences.  He has now changed his mind and stated he will see the area where he hunts deer in a whole new light from now on.I believe the witness has retold his encounter as it happened and I am convinced what he saw was indeed a Bigfoot.   This is a sketch drawn by the witness:",
