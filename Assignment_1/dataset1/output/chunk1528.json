            "Follow-Up Report": " - The sasquatch  had a solid heavyset frame.  It could be described as looking like someone with shoulder pads and numerous heavy wool sweaters on.  But too huge to be human.- Its arms were longer than a humans and thick. Hands with digits were seen that had hair on them.- It walked covering ground quickly.  Its strides were long and its arms were swinging.  It covered long distances in just a few steps.  -Its facial profile was flat, its chest was flat and there were no breasts observed.   - She was able to see NO snout, it walked on TWO legs, and it had no apparent interest in her except that it turned its head when she flashed her small light on it.  She saw the right side of it but at 35-40 yards away, the precise observations you would hope for were not available.-First alerted to it by the sounds it made walking down the dirt road.  (Kind of a dragging sound).   Didnt sound quite right to her and she looked to see it.  She described it as not looking right for a person.  Too burley & large, very wide,  \"massive\".  -It remains unknown whether or not the screams heard before her visual observation were related or not.   They were not familiar sounds that had at anytime before been heard by either husband or wife. ",
