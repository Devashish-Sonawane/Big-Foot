He has a cement pad about 10 by 6 ft with a fence 6ft high around three sides of it. The trash cans were inside the fence.On night he heard noises out side,he got his rifle and looked out back.The porch light showed nothing near the trash cans but outside the fence he could see a shape of something so he shot up in the air.The animal ,which he could only describe as a big ape,got up and he could see it's shouders and head above the fence.It took off as it rose up turning back towards the woods in a hurry.It tore up freshly planted bushes in it's path. The ground left  no tracks other then in the soft dirt around the bushes.That's the plaster cast the neighbor showed me.He gave it to the neighbor because he decided he didn't believe in what he saw and didn't want to be haunted by the sighting.They had the police there but I guess he made sure it was kept out of the papers.He just didn't want his name out there.",
