            "Observed": "During November -December hunting season in 1981 my stepfather took us hunting many times in the Snipes Island Grade/Econfina River area area. His family had owned many acres of land in that area for years. We spent quite a bit of time in the area camping out sleeping in makeshift lean-tos. Numerous times while being left alone I can remember the eerie sensation like we were being watched and the hair standing up on the back of my neck. One evening it all came to a climax. After a day of hunting discussing how astounded we were as to how quiet it had been and how still the game was. There was no sound of crickets or nothing, not even a bird making a noise. There was one noise we did hear occasionally which sounded like a hoot owl on steroids.  (After listening to some vocalizations on here I am sure they are the same) We did discuss a very distinct odor which smelled like a skunk or worse. My step father said it was just a wild hog or so he thought and we made nothing of it. Hours later I remember being awakened by my step father setting up and screaming at something to get away. He quickly fired several shots of a rifle up into the air. ( The same stench at this time was terrible and gut wrenching) We could all hear a loud crashing noise as whatever it was ran off into the woods. As we sit up and was talking he described a tall looming figure which walked up and was looming over the lean to was looming over it. He guessed at least 7 feet tall.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to MA over the phone for about an hour. He was very sincere and forthright in relating the experience he had in 1981.MA had grown up in Taylor Co, FL and had hunted and fished his whole life. When he was approximately 16 years old, he accompanied his stepfather, RT, as well as the rest of the family and an older friend, AG, to a remote and primitive hunt camp that was on property owned by the family, for a weekend of camping and hunting.The area they camped at had been used several times by the family. There were rugged, homemade lean-to\u0092s that were to be used to sleep under, as well as a fire pit. MA had remarked that both RT and AG, very experienced woodsman, found it extremely odd that the \u0091usual\u0092 animal noises were eerily absent during this particular outing. \u0093I remember thinking that it was really weird.\u0094 commented MA. \u0093Usually we would hear lots of frogs and insects and stuff. But this time the woods were just dead. No animal noises.\u0094During the days leading up to the encounter, the whole family would often hear vocalizations that they could not explain. MA stated that they mostly sounded like \u0091whoop\u0092 calls, starting out low and gaining a higher pitch at the end. He said that they were sometimes a singular vocalization, or at other times, multiple vocalizations from different parts of the woods, \u0093like \u0091they\u0092 were calling out to each other. Each sounded sort of the same, but you could tell a difference between each one because the tone was different. It was sort of like two people saying the same word, but you know that it\u0092s from two different people. Even though it sounded kind of like an owl, it wasn\u0092t like any animal noise I\u0092ve ever heard before.\u0094MA also remarked that the family would sometimes encounter a \u0091horrible\u0092 smell while hiking through the woods. MA described a \u0091feeling\u0092 of \u0091being watched\u0092 that \u0091made the hair on the back of my neck stand up\u0092 when he was alone. They would often hear 'Lots of knocking', that, like the vocalizations, were sometimes singular in nature, or coming from different parts of the woods. \u0093You might hear two or three knocks, then it got quite. Or you might hear two or three knocks in one direction and a few minutes later, two or three knocks coming from somewhere else. It sounded like a big, solid stick being banged against a tree. We really didn\u0092t know what was going on.\u0094Sometime during that night, between 1100pm-200am, MA awoke to the sounds of gunfire and the sound of his stepfather 'yelling at the top of his lungs'. Just after the gunfire and yelling ceased, MA heard something that he describes as \u0091huge\u0092, running into the woods, breaking limbs and crashing into trees. By then the whole family was awake and wondering what in the world was going on. MA states that it was his stepfather, RT, that had fired the rifle, and that he appeared agitated and \u0091scared\u0092. About 10 minutes, they all heard the sound of two or three distinct wood-knocks that came from the area the \u0091intruder\u0092 had headed.RT would later describe what he saw that night to MA. He stated that he couldn\u0092t sleep because he just felt that \u0091something\u0092 wasn\u0092t right. At some point during the night he was about to get up to stoke the fire when he heard \u0091something\u0092 creeping up to his lean-to, and saw, what he described, as \u0091a tall figure, about 7-8 foot tall\u0092 looming over him, peering into the lean-to. He refused to talk about it in any detail, only saying later that it looked like a \u0091big, hairy ape\u0092. And he was adamant that it wasn\u0092t a bear or a human. (When I asked MA if his stepfather had shot at the \u0091intruder\u0092, or up into the air, MA stated that he really didn\u0092t know.)According to MA, RT was not the type of person to scare easily. He had done a few stints in jail and was known for his brusque manner and as a \u0091tough-guy\u0092. But for the rest of the night, stated MA, RT sat up for the rest of the night \u0091to keep the fire burning bright\u0092. At sunrise, RT packed up the family and according to MA, \u0091Got the hell out of there\u0092. According to MA, his stepfather appeared \u0091scared and nervous\u0092 until the time they left.Just after his stepfather fired his gun, MA stated that when he awoke, there was an over-whelming, \u0091horrendous\u0092 odor that permeated the area around the camp. He stated that it was sort of like a \u0091skunky\u0092 smell, but worse. He said that he had smelled skunks in the past, and this was far, far worse. \u0093It was like nothing I have ever smelled before, or since.\u0094When asked how he could recall these encounters in so much detail, MA stated that \u0093I was so damn scared, I remember everything in vivid detail. You just can\u0092t forget this kind of thing.\u0094After this incident, MA has refused to go back to that area. He continued to hunt from time to time, but he has vowed never to go back to that area again, even though his family had owned the property. When asked about the whereabouts of his stepfather now, MA says that he had lost contact with him. He also stated that his younger sister refuses to talk about the incident. The only contact that he could think of that might recall and talk about the incident was his stepfather\u0092s friend, AG. He has since tried to make contact with AG.This incident occurred outside of the northern border of the 4400 acre Econfina River State Park. The property has since been purchased by the Florida Government to be used as state wildlife preserves. This area encompasses a vast network of highlands, lowlands, rivers, and salt marsh estuaries. Wildlife flourishes in this area, including turkeys, white tailed deer and bear. Outside of the State forests and protected areas there is still little development, even to this day.",
