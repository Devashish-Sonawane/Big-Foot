            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on 10-8-05.  The witness is an avid, long-time hunter and is familiar with the local wildlife. He has seen bears in the woods and forests of northern New Jersey.  He was adamant that what he saw was not a bear.  He has hunted on this 20-30 acre private tract of land both prior to, and after the sighting. The forested area where the sighting occurred is populated by conifers, hardwoods and streams and is relatively flat with lots of rock outcroppings. Prior to daybreak, the witnesses walked on an old logging trail and then turned off toward a familiar tree stand approximately 40-50 yards away.  As he approached the stand, the witness began to sense a very potent, strong, harsh smell in the area. He described the odor as being very sour and musty.  He described the odor as much stronger and more intense than the various hunting scents that hunters often use .  He climbed into the deer stand and remained there for approximately 2 hrs.  During this time, he mentioned that the smell would come and go in intensity, although it was never as strong as when he initially arrived in the area. No deer were observed in the area while he was in the stand.  Having no luck, he climbed down from the stand and returned to the logging trail.  The odor then began to increase in intensity as he walked. Then approximately 50 yards down the trail, he saw a very large upright animal emerge onto the trail from his right-hand side. It stopped on the trail for a few seconds and turned its\u0092 upper body and head toward the witness. He noted that the animal had longer, more shaggy hair on the lower part of its body, with lighter hair on the chest and head.  He described the animal having very broad shoulders, no neck, and minimal facial hair with a  \u0091shiny\u0092 face. The creature was too far away to make out any additional features. They stared at each other for approximately 4 or 5 seconds.  No vocalizations were heard. It then casually and calmly walked off the trail into the forest and out of view.  It remained bipedal throughout the duration of the sighting. The witness then turned around and began to very rapidly run off in the opposite direction.  He recalled hearing a very loud and distinct, cracking sound as he moved away.  The next day he returned with the landowner to the exact area on the logging trail where the sighting occurred to retrieve a knapsack he had dropped while leaving the day before. He looked around the area for footprints but did not see any in the immediate area.  However, in the area just off the trail where the animal exited, the witness saw a large branch with a clean, fresh break.  He believed this branch to be the source of the loud, cracking sound he had heard the day before. This sighting took place off of Westbrook Road in Passaic County near the Wanaque Reservoir.  This area is part of a large mountainous tract of relatively undeveloped land that runs northwest through Passaic County into New York.  The area is known as the Wyanokie Highlands that is part of the New Jersey \u0091Highlands Province\u0092.  This region consists of rugged topography characterized by series of discontinuous rounded ridges separated by deep narrow valleys.Notably, this sighting occurred approximately 8 miles north of another recently reported sighting (report 12065) and approximately 5 miles east of the Apshawa Mountain, Zeliff Pond and Van Nostrand Lake areas where day hikers and employees of a local N.J. outdoor paintball club have reported other sightings and vocalizations.",

If you hiked up that hill not far you would come to a burnt out Redwood laying across bank to bank. Looking up the hill to your left there would be a big stump and at one time my brothers playhouse. That is where I had my sighting. I never knew until my sister and I were both adults that she had aa sighting in the exact location only he was standing on the log.",

            "Observed": "I grew up on the mountain along the Eel river (Kings Range) I can not tell you the exact year that I had this sighting not sure if I was 11 or 12. That would of put it at 62 thru 64. I was below our house and used to go down to the spring and just hang out out. I got halfway down and looked across and there was this big ape in my mind looking at me. It is still so clear that moment. I do know that I left first and I never said a word to anyone what I saw. Our house burned down in 67 or 68 and we moved to Eureka. When my sister and I became adults I told her what I saw that day and she started crying she had experined the same thing only she was down at the spring and he was above her on the log. I moved back to the home place the spring of 1972 and everything was fine. I lived there with my son and at that time whoever needed a place. That Fall everyone pretty much left and as the nightly custom I would build a fire and my son and I would sit around it and eat. We had no electricity or anything. That hillside always rang with birdsong  never a quiet moment. That night there was silence and a wierd feeling came over me like eyes were watching . I grabbed my son and a few clothes and we hiked down to the nearest house. I never went back there to live it scared me that bad. There is alot more stories I could tell you about this mountain but I will leave that for later. I know what I saw that day and I know the feelings that I had years later. I would like to say that this was 40 acres that I grew up on and always felt safe after that night I left I never got that feeling back again something changed. The birds never sang like before either.  I would like to say I sent this account to Bobbie Short 2 years ago but asked not to have it published . The only reason I'm writting it now is because of the 2 other accounts that I read.",

She was about 11 years old at the time and saw what she thought was a gorilla looking at her from the opposite side on a small creek on a steep bank.   She said it was about 100 feet from her and just stared at her while she walked backwards up the hill in retreat.  She remembered the eyes, saying it appeared as if it was looking directly into her eyes.  Its body was covered with hair, but her view was hampered by the shade in the area.No movement was noticed from this animal, as it was standing, facing her.After telling her sister this story, her sister admitted that she too saw a sasquatch, in the same creek area, although this time it was standing on a stump looking down at her.Both sisters never told anyone about what had happened and, at the time of the sighting, were unaware of the term \u0093Bigfoot\u0094The witness learned of the BFRO through an article in National Geographic.I did get the phone number of the sister and will try to contact her later this week and have her also submit a report.",
