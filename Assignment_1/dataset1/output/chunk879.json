            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with RK by phone and he seemed quite relieved to get this encounter in the public realm. He was surprised at the time how nonchalant the rangers were about their encounter. The driver (RK) was sleeping when the encounter began. He has lost contact with his friend, the passenger, since he moved from the area. All the windows had limo tint on them which was the preferred tint here in Florida until the authorities outlawed it. You could not see inside from the outside, but your can see outside while inside. In the front windshield was a large reflective panel that keeps out the sun during the day. RK says that after about 45 minutes of sleeping in their seats in the small Eclipse, his friend in the passenger seat woke him by squeezing his hand and arm so hard, he could feel his fingernails digging in. RK opened his eyes to a look of horror on his friend's face, and he was gesturing to the driver's window where RK was resting his head. RK slowly turned his head and right next to his head was the face of a large apelike creature looking in. RK described the face as huge, with a broader nose than a man, but not like a gorilla. It was hooded as ours is, very hairy except around the eyes and cheeks. He did not see the teeth, but it was smelling and exhaling hard and left its breath on the window. It moved from the window, to the windshield, and back to the window several times. It seemed frustrated that it couldn't determine if anyone was in the car. At one point, it put its hands on the top of the car and gave it a little shake. It finally walked in an upright fashion to the dumpster a few yards from where they were parked. They could see it clearly in the moonlight. RK described it as tall, 6'10\" to 7', covered in hair about 4\" long, with a neck and built more like a basketball player than a body builder. It was tall and lanky. RK got the impression it was young and under fed. The chest area had a little less hair on it, and RK didn't see any breasts, so he surmised it was a male, even though he couldn't confirm it. The lid to the dumpster was already open and the creature reached in to picked thru what was in there and did nibble on a few items. All the witnesses could see how this couldn't be a guy in a costume as the arms were way too long for a man. After about an hour and a half of watching this animal amble about the dumpster it started to move off into a large prairie on the other side of the road. As it slowly walked, they watched it turn its head and make a scream like a wolf/coyote howl. The other passengers in the car became quite nervous again and thought it was calling others to join it here at this spot. The passenger in the back seat wanted to get the gun and shoot it. RK said no and to just sit still and let it move away. It howled several times as it slowly moved off and out of sight. All the occupants were quite warm in the sealed up car and the windows were beginning to fog up now. They at this time slowly cracked the windows and could really smell it strong now.They found a ranger station and excitedly related the story. The rangers asked if they had a gun in the car and RK answered yes (he had a permit). The rangers asked if they shot at it and they said no. The rangers stressed the point that it was a crime to shoot at any animals in the park. They did take a few notes and said yes, they were aware of the creature, and this was just one of hundreds of reports they get. They told them the Florida name for the creature, the Skunk Ape. The witness chose this Pete Travers sketch, one that best matches the head and body of what he saw. ",

Again it was at dusk at the edge of town near a canyon that has a lot of trees.  She and my niece saw a large hairy creature peeking out of a barn window, they became histerical and ran home.  The creature had reddish brown hair according to my daughter and black hair according to my niece.  It was watching them play catch.  Their uncle came out to check almost immediately and found nothing but some indents in the soft dirt in the barn below the open window. He said the creature would have to be couched down in order to look through the window but for some reason the girls said he was large, maybe the size of his head and shoulders was large. Our tribal people are split between whether bigfoot is a spirit creature or real.  Their uncle felt they saw a spirit creature because their were no footprints and why would the creature brush his footprints from the soft dirt?",
