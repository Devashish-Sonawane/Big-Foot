She and her teenage son were driving home at approx. 9:45pm...about 5 miles from home, the witness spotted something in her headlights (low beams). At first she thought it was a bear, and alerted her son in the backseat, but then saw it stand fully erect on two legs. It was holding something white in its hand. As she drove and the distance closed, the animal turned and began to run on two legs in the same direction as the witness was driving. She watched it run from behind. The witness ran track for many years and is familiar with all aspects of running. She explained this creature ran faster than any human could ever run, both in speed and stride. The white object in its hand (which she later surmised was a chicken) was nothing but a blur as the creature ran. She observed the overdeveloped calf, thigh, and glute' muscles as it covered ground in her headlights. The creature eventually turned and ran out of her view and into the woods. The next day she retraced her route and at the spot where she first saw the creature, she noticed a large chicken coop in the front yard, full of white and brown chickens.",
