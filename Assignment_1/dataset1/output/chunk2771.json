            "Observed": "I\u0092m 50 now, but when I was 15 my father had a modern cabin, I designed and drafted, in lower upper Michigan, near Gladwin, Michigan.  I saw your Michigan episode today and wanted you to know about something I saw in the woods near Streaked Lake.  I know the county pretty good as I hunted, fished and snowmobiled in the area.  We lived in Brooklyn, MI and would travel to the cabin on my dad's days off.  The winter of 77/78, don\u0092t remember the month, my younger brother and I were out doing nighttime, off trail snowmobiling.  We were on the state park next to my dads place.  My brother was leading, we were in Cedar Pines most of them not more than 10 inches in diameter (I know this because my dad use to have me cut firewood, and poles for fences.) Snow was pretty deep and we were moving over snags pretty good at about 10 mph.  My brother took a turn ahead of me, he was about 50 feet or so in front of me, as I began my turn to follow to the left my headlight caught something next to a 6\u0094 cedar, it stood about 7 or more feet, it had its left hand on the tree, looking over its bicep at me, its body was turned toward my brother.  I thought I was seeing things but its body was showing on the other side of the tree.  A bear came to mind but then as I was watching it, a gorilla is what I thought.  As I made my turn it was about 10 feet off to my right.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness who now lives in Oregon.   He states he was following his brother on a snowmobile and seen the animal leaning against a tree with it's arm and looking over it's arm towards him.  The only thing to move was it's head.  He said it was similar in coloration to a cedar tree, kind of a dark grey.  He could clearly see the hair, arms, torso and other details.  The sighting was very brief, as he only seen it as his snowmobile was making a turn.  He did see it's head turn and follow his brother as he rode by.  His brother did not notice it.At the time they were riding off trail and he stated he thinks the animal was surprised to see them come through.  The witness told his brother and father what he had seen and the next day they followed their snowmobile tracks to the location.  They found tracks where it stood at the tree and tracks leading away, but it had snowed during the night and partially covered them.  The witness later went on to join the military and served as a police officer in Montana for a number of years.  He stated it was years ago, but clearly remembers the event.The area is surrounded by the AuSable State Forest and has numerous small lakes and heavy forest.  There are plentiful small game and deer in the area.  Two small nearby lakes, Trout Lake and Hoister Lake also have state camp grounds at them, which I have personally camped at many times as a teenager.  To the south the area opens up with many area farms with numerous food crops.",
