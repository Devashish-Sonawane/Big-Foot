            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a 20 yr. old college student. He lives with his family near Shady Springs, WV. He, his friends, and family hunt at every opportunity. Prior to the sighting reported here, he had only minimal interest in sasquatch. His opinion has changed.I spoke to the witness for approximately one hour. He is credible. The creature was sighted approximately 200 yards from the observer, up hill from a public road and at the top of a hay field. Near the creature was a barbed wire fence. The fence served to illustrate its size. He stated the fence is about four feet high and the creature was nearly twice as high as the fence. The sighting occurred between 6:00 and 6:30 pm, on September 21st. The creature was walking away from the witness, appearing to be brown in color. The field where the creature was seen normally has several deer present at the same time of day, this was an exception. I asked about the nearest occupied dwelling at the sighting location. He reported from the sasquatch's location, there were two dwellings on each side of it, each over 400 yards distant. In all total, not more than four houses are within line of sight of the creature. He included friends and family anecdotal sighting information.",
