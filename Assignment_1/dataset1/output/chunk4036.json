            "Observed.1  ": "Instead, he claims he saw a Sasquatch. A Yeti. A creature more commonly referred to as Bigfoot. Actually, he claims he saw two. Bigfeet? You be the judge. According to the witness\u0092s account, posted on the website for the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, they were walking their dog in Harris one evening between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m., after dark, when a creature began throwing rocks at them. \u0093At first I thought it was some kids screwing around, until I got through the trail to the pond in back,\u0094 the witness wrote. \u0093I was paralyzed with fear after what happened next. I believe it was a Bigfoot that ran out about 10 feet in front of me and stopped for about 15 seconds, it let out a very loud scream right at me then turned around and ran straight through the pond.\u0094 He continued, \u0093I also noticed that behind me appeared to be another very large figure that ran the opposite direction. The first one I got a very clear view of, (it) was eight to nine feet tall with very wide shoulders about twice as wide as mine, it had dark brown hair mixed with some gray, and it smelled awful. I did not get a very good look at the other one but it did appear to be eight to 10 feet tall.\u0094 The witness claimed to be a skeptical person who is not a believer of such things. \u0093That being said I am having a hard time coming up with an explanation for this,\u0094 he wrote. It is the only actual sighting reported in Kendall County on the BFRO\u0092s website, although there was a report of Bigfoot noises in Kendall in 2006. Other nearby counties have had sightings \u0096 Grundy and Kane each have four listed on the website. Bigfoot expert: Sasquatch sighted in northern Illinois Stan Courtney, a central Illinois Bigfoot researcher whose website and blog \u0096 StanCourtney.com \u0096 contains information on sightings in Illinois going back to the fall of 1883, said it\u0092s possible that the large beasts would be found in northern Illinois. Courtney said there are plenty of areas in northern Illinois that are heavily wooded, perfect for a Bigfoot. \u0093There\u0092s an immense amount of forest; all those park preserves. Most of them are interconnected with wooded streams,\u0094 he said.  Courtney said he and other researchers involved with the BFRO\u0092s website talk to the witnesses on the phone and ask them questions about their experiences. \u0093All these reports where they obviously don\u0092t have any video or audio, or foot casts or anything, they\u0092re anecdotal,\u0094 he said. \u0093All of our witnesses that we\u0092ve received reports from, we\u0092ve talked to them on the phone. So when we get them on the phone, we have to judge whether we think the person is telling the truth. Because we get an immense amount of the other type as well. Usually, they won\u0092t give us a phone number, or if they do, they won\u0092t come to the phone.\u0094 In the case of the BFRO website, Courtney said the witnesses \u0096 including the one that filed the report on the Harris Forest Preserve sighting \u0096 are granted confidentiality. He said witnesses in urban or suburban areas are going to be more reluctant to tell people what they\u0092ve seen.  \u0093They\u0092re actually going to be more questioning of themselves, and they\u0092re more open to ridicule, and they\u0092re going to tell less people than those who live in a rural area,\u0094 he said. Courtney said he has made recordings of Sasquatch-related sounds in Cook County forest preserves. He said he had a friend who was a skeptic who had a \u0093daylight sighting near Brookfield Zoo.\u0094 \u0093I think they\u0092re in that area,\u0094 he said. \u0093I can\u0092t tell you numbers. The witnesses are much, much more unlikely to come forward just because of other factors.\u0094 The Illinois River area, he said, has a long history of sightings, particularly around Seneca, he said. Courtney said that Bigfoot creatures also possibly use bike paths along wooded areas and forest preserves, especially at night, to travel. \u0093It\u0092s fair game to them; they can move up and down those,\u0094 he said. \u0093I also think they use railroad tracks a lot \u0096 abandoned railroad tracks or even current ones. If I wanted to go five miles through the woods, and there was a railroad track there, I\u0092d go down the railroad tracks.\u0094 Contrary to popular belief, Bigfoot isn\u0092t just based in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, he said. \u0093When I was a kid, it was only the Yeti in the Himalyas,\u0094 he said. \u0093And then, with the Patterson film, we knew it was in the Pacific Northwest.\u0094 The Patterson film is a famous home movie made by two men \u0096 Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin \u0096 in a national forest in northern California in October 1967 that supposedly shows evidence of a walking Sasquatch creature.  Although scientists have criticized the film and some people have come forward to claim that it is a man in a suit, both filmmakers long insisted that it is the real thing. Patterson died in 1972 but Gimlin is still alive and makes appearances at Bigfoot-related events. Courtney said that if a Bigfoot was in the area, it would most likely feast on deer. \u0093Most animals stay where the prey species is, and for these guys, especially in winter, it\u0092s deer,\u0094 he said. \u0093And you know what a large deer population we have here in Illinois.\u0094 No official sightings, county officials say Although he joked that the county has a secret \u0093Bigfoot breeding program,\u0094 Jason Pettit, director of the Kendall County Forest Preserve District, said the county hasn\u0092t received reports of Bigfoot creatures. \u0093I have some employees that maybe closely resemble that, but that\u0092s about it,\u0094 he said, laughing. \u0093I have one employee that says it\u0092s his dream that he\u0092d like to dress up in a Sasquatch outfit\u0085 but no official sightings, no.\u0094 And Forest Preserve District officials further said that, in all seriousness, the person who witnessed the Bigfoot incident was actually breaking the law. Entering the forest preserves after dark is an offense that could result in a fine or arrest, they said. So, for now, the Bigfoot legend of Harris Forest Preserve remains only that.",
