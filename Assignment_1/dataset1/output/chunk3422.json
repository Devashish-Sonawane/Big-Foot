About midnight we heard a vocalization like nothing either of us had heard before. We are both avid outdoorsmen I have hunted all around the country and never heard anything like what I heard last night, except for the Bigfoot sounds on the BFRO website, it was not very long but I could still here it, it was loud and clear.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on the evening of September 4th. In my opinion this person did hear something and is not fabricating this story.From what he described there could only be two animals that are capable of making this type of vocalization, a coyote or a sasquatch. There are no wolves in this area.This person spends a lot of time outdoors and has traveled to different wilderness areas around the country, he knows the calls coyotes can make and he said this was not a coyote.He estimated the call was less then a half mile away but in the distance, not very close. The howl was long and drawn out then stopped, then 15 to 20 mts. later the exact same howl was repeated. There were no further howls heard after that.The witness said the howl sounded just like the Ohio Howl below.Click here for the Ohio Howl Recording",
