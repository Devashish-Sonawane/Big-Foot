I thought it was a bear or something.  Then it took of and ran across the road behind my car.  I was so surprised and shocked I did not stop.  It was about 6 ft plus and it crossed the road in three steps or so.",

The witness first saw what he took to be the rear of a bear or elk on the side of the road and turned his lights to bright. \"It seemed like it must have been bent over or something, but then it went upright and across the road\". It crossed the  two lane road on two legs and did so in two or three steps. The witness stressed the length of the strides. It crossed immediately after his car passed. His view at this time was in the rear view mirror. He most clearly could see it from the lower torso down, but he did not get a good look at the upper torso or head. The gait was described as \"just like a person doing a quick stride\" - a fast walk, not an actual run.  He described the hair color as dark brown and comparable to an Irish Setter in length. He saw \"a definite outline of hair moving, like a woman's hair would flow when they move quickly\". He estimated the height to be between six and one half to seven feet. He described the body build as \" very stocky\". At no time did he see any eye shine from the creature.",

            "Observed": "Around 1:00 am on October 1st, I got up out of bed to get a drink of water and was having trouble falling asleep. As I walked by my kitchen window, I peered out and noticed three pairs of red eyes walking single file about 20 yards up in the woods. I've been a hunter and outdoorsman since I was 6 yrs old and have seen many animals and eyes at night so I wasn't all that surprised. But what really had me perplexed was the height at which the eyes were above ground level. I would estimate that the eyes were hovering around the 7 ft mark at least so that rules out any wildlife that I'm familiar with. The intensity of the glowing red was also unlike anything I have ever experienced or seen before and the creatures appeared to be walking with comfortable balance and agility. It was pitch black and could not make out any silhouettes except a few branches moving. There is 4 miles worth of wilderness behind my house and most of it is government land. I have no idea what I saw that night but am open minded to it being a sasquatch or another creature that I'm unfamiliar with. Have not talked much about it to other people and am afraid people will think I'm losing it but I can't stop thinking about what I saw. Thanks very much!",
