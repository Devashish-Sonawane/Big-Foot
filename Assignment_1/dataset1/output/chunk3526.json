There were many large creeks in the area, a sewage treatment plant, and heavily forested areas to the north and east of the swamp, which was probably only a half-mile square. We also found evidence in the swamp of its previous history - upright ties 15 feet high from the ground-part of an old wall? There were three of them about ten to fifteen feet apart in a row. Further back we found an old rotting outhouse. Then further back still, we found a skinny mound of earth that went straight for several hundred feet - off of this we found some pea plants. The creek in the swamp near where we first encountered the creatures' screams seemed to have been man made. Like a small irrigation ditch. It was about three feet wide, had vertical sides and a flat bottom. All together a very strange place!",
