            "Follow-Up Report": "After a telephone interview with the witness, a few details can be added to his report. He is a soldier stationed at Ft. Carson and was in between tours of Iraq at the time of this sighting. Prior to this incident, he had not even considered the possibility of these creatures being present in this area but a subsequent internet search convinced him that he may have actually seen a bigfoot because of the numerous other reports in the same general vicinity. For fear of ridicule, he has not discussed his apparent sighting with anyone but felt compelled to make it known and get it on the record.From his vantage point, the figure was off to the west toward Table Mountain and was headed in a northerly direction toward Cheyenne Mountain and the southern slopes of Pikes Peak. The location is on or very near the El Paso and Fremont County line.After first noticing the movement, he watched the figure in the distance by eye for almost a minute.  Realizing that it was much larger than a turkey, he continued watching through his binoculars for another thirty to forty-five seconds. Due to the uniform dark-brown to black coloring and apparent size, he then thought he was looking at a bear, and then a bear on two legs, at which point he was stunned by the certainty that it was not a bear. The figure clearly walked on two legs for the duration of the sighting. The witness was struck by the apparent speed of the creature walking, but never running, which covered an estimated three to four hundred meters or more while he was focused in on it. He felt certain that, in comparison, he would not be able to cover that amount of distance in that time. The figure was in the open in high grass until he lost sight of it when it went into the brush and then behind a hillside. He kept watching in that direction for several more minutes but saw nothing more.David Petti",

The second encounter was 5 months ago I was riding on my four wheeler and I went past a big patch of woods and he just stood there and watched me. The third encounter was 2 months ago I was driving home from work and he was retreating into the woods by a telephone pole. The fourth encounter was about 5 days after the third encounter and the bigfoot was walking through one of our old knocked down barns and I was out on my porch just watching him and he looked at me then he ran off and hurdled a five foot barbwire fence. The last encounter was just about three days ago and he was goin down a trail in our woods",
