            "Follow-Up Report": "This report corrolates to 6600, has solid footing and should be saved but not published yet. AB 10/27/04*****Spoke with witness by phone. Here's more background to his report: During the 1980s the witness had 640 acres under lease from a group of Los Gatos attorneys in the Vollmers area near Dog Creek and Pollard Flat on the Upper Sacramento River above Shasta Lake, where they had a small ranching operation that included laying hens, horses, cattle, hogs, and a 40 acre apple orchard.  To help make ends meet he cooked at the Pollard Flat truck stop restaurant, where he met Chance, a Virginia pig farmer, who owned and was building a home on a 40 acre track of partially meadowed timberland southwest of Dog Creek. He says on the day he visited Chance in the Fall of 1986, the ground was moist from snow and rain, and what Chance showed him in the ground behind his house at first appeared to be bear tracks, but there was something different about them that struck him as odd.  There were no claw marks, he said.  Chance showed him where he'd hung the deer in a tree across a small creek, gutted and strung by a rope to air about 10 feet above the ground. The creature that \"grabbed\" it would have weighed 350 to 400 pounds, as Chance described it, and it was taller than himself (witness) at six feet, and when Chance put his flashlight on it, it had momentarily looked back at him with eyes that were \"blood red and piercing,\" and had \"screamed\" before running off with the deer.  Chance showed him hair taken from the barbed wire, which he thought afterward was too coarse and light in color for bear hair, although he guessed at the time it could have been bear.Floyd, Chance's hired hand of Hoopa and Navajo descent, showed up at Rick's on \"Superbowl Sunday\" 1986, yelling that Chance was dead.  Rick says he and a sheriff's deputy went to Chance's place and found Chance on the ground there, shot in the head, and he died six days later at the hospital.  They also found another person on the ground nearby, who was dead with a bullet in his chest.  He was one of two brothers from the Redding area who had been poaching Chance's pigs.  Chance was 56, and left a daughter.  Witness feels the daughter probably sold the property and moved on, as she was from the city and not interested in ranching or the wild.  Witness hasn't been back to the area since 1996.",
