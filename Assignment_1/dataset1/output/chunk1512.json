            "Follow-Up Report": "After talking with Richard on the phone he and I met at the Holy Cross Cemetery. Richard has a Bachelors degree from Lake Superior State University, his hobbies include fishing and genealogy and he spends a lot of time on the U.P. roads for his job. He conveyed to me that this experience has stuck with him ever since it happened almost 14 years ago. What brought it back to the front of his mind was reading Report #40801, which happened less than 5 miles down the highway. Although the landscape has changed significantly since the sighting, I have no reason to believe this was anything but a legitimate sighting.The Holy Cross Cemetery sits to the north of M-35 south of Escanaba. At the time of the sighting there was a dirt road to the north of the cemetery that separated it from the Delta County Airport, which has now been paved and extended to a house. There was also a very thick forest/swamp with the Portage Creek running through it and the airport that went right up to the road and bordered the cemetery on the west side, that has since been logged off and turned into building sites. On the east side of the cemetery there is still a very thick stand of trees separating it from the airport access road and the church that is still used by the deer in and around the airport to move across the highway to Lake Michigan, much like they would use a fence line in between farm fields.The sighting happened in the early evening and he remembers feeling as if he was being watched from the time he entered the cemetery and exited his car. He was in the middle of the cemetery looking for the grave sites of Veterans for a database he was helping maintain when he noticed some movement in front, and to the right of him, which would have been to the northeast along the east side of the cemetery. He initially thought it was a deer until he looked up and saw a very large human shaped creature 100 to 150 yards away looking back at him from the edge of the trees. Because it was inside the edge of the treeline in the shadows he did not get a really good look at it with any kind of great detail other than it was bipedal and dark brown to black in color. As soon as he felt safe to move he backed away from where he was and went back to his car and left. He has not had any other experiences like this at the cemetery since then but does still frequently visit it.",
