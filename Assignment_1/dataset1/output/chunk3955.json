The hair was between five to six inches long, and was dark brown to black. She compared it to a shaggy dog. The arms were very long almost to the ground. She had no doubt that it walked on two legs, not four, as it proceeded slowly into the woods. She said it had an ape like appearence.The witness also recalled when she was a child playing in the woods close to her house, she would find tent like structures made out of thorny branches woven together. On more than one occasion she had the uneasy feeling of being watched while playing in the woods. In one instance she and her friend where chased out of the woods by something running behind them. They could not see what it was but they could hear it breathing. The witness also heard strange screams coming from the woods close to her house when she was a child. The only incident where she saw something was the one she describes, above.",
