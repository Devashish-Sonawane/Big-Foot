            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and I have discussed his experiences, with what he and others call \"The White Thing\", by telephone numerous times. In mentioning the animal's unusually long steps/stride, he explained that the animal's steps appeared to be about six feet apart, having a resultant stride of nearly twelve feet. When asked if he was able to describe other facial features that were not included in his submission, he stated with certainty that the animal's eyes were not brown or black, but of a pinkish, light red color. He said that when the animal curled its top lip to expose its teeth, he noticed its gums were very red, in contrast with the light colored skin on the outside of the lips and the exposed skin on its face. He, and others who have seen that animal (or a very similar white haired animal) in this general area of the state, believe the animal(s) are albinos. During our discussion, he hesitantly mentioned that when the animal was walking away there was something odd about the way its legs flexed at the knees, appearing to bow slightly backward. He was unable to adequately define or explain the apparent anomaly, and neither can this investigator.His second sighting occurred about one year later when he, his sister, and three other friends drove to the edge of a hillside overlooking the All-American Drop Zone near the northern edge of Camp Robinson just after dark. At that time the public could drive into the area and watch the C-130 aircraft from the Jacksonville AF base practice air drops - day or night - on a specially prepared and maintained drop zone below the ridge. The area around the drop zone was covered in grass on which numerous deer grazed, especially at night.The night sky was reportedly very clear with a partial moon. The group was standing along the edge of the ridge, with a fairly steep slope below them. Just a few minutes after their arrival, the primary witness noticed what appeared to be a white, inanimate object on the slope about 30 yards below the group. He periodically glancing down at the white object - which he thought was a bag hanging on a limb of brush - he noticed the object moved slightly. Out of curiosity, he picked up a rock and threw it toward the object. The rock missed, so he picked up another, took better aim and threw again. He, and two of the others, were shocked to see that the \"object\" ducked the rock that passed just over its head. Immediately the primary witness and Jim O realized the \"object\" was the animal they knew as the \"White Thing.\" Both jumped up and yelled for the others to run to the car, which all except the owner of the car did. Two of the group reacted slower, and saw the animal coming up the slope toward them. The car - which belonged to Jerry - was about 15 yards from them. The car windows were down, and the primary witness dove through the window into the back seat on the passenger side as Jim O. dove into the front seat on that side the same way. Both girls - at least one of which had seen the animal charging up the slope - opened the doors to get inside. Jerry stood outside for a few seconds looking around while the others screamed at him to get in and \"get us out of here.\" Then, realizing their fear, he ran to the car, jumped behind the wheel, started the engine and began driving down the dirt/gravel road at high speed. The vehicle generated a cloud of thick dust, although the primary witness, looking through the back window, briefly saw the \"White Thing\" running a few yards behind the car before the vehicle sped away. During the telephone discussions with the reporting witness, he also stated that while hunting in Clark County near the town of Hollywood AR during the the fall of 1988, he had a brief sighting of a very large bipedal animal walking quickly through the woods away from him. He described it as \"pushing nine feet\" in height, covered in \"reddish brown\" hair and having very wide shoulders. He said the animal had the body mass of at least two large human males. After many discussions with the primary witness about the incidents described in this report, I believe he is a credible observer.",
