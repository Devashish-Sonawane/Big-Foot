            "Observed": "Late one spring evening in 1979 or 1980 a young lady and I were parked on a pipeline off of a road to the east of Highway 59 a few miles north of Splendora. We had been at this spot for about 45 minutes. I thought I heard a noise come from in front of us, like a rustling of the trees or undergrowth. I sat up and turned on the headlights and saw a very large creature standing about six feet from the front of my truck. It stood at least seven feet tall and possibly taller, was covered in dark brown or reddish brown hair. I quickly started the truck and backed away, when I turned back to get another look at the creature it was gone. I wasn't able to get a clear look at the face.",
