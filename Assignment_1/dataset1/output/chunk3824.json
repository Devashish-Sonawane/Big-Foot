It had long dark brown hair all over except his face & hands.  He appeared to have mud stuck to his hair as it was matted in places, especially his legs and arms.  His face was very dark or dirty.  The hair on his chest was shorter than his back, head, arms and legs.  His arms were very long and he swung them open handed, front to back as he walked.",

We had all grown up in and around the woods but this sound was louder and so unusual that we all turned around at the same time.  When we first saw it, behind us, at the same spot we had just come from a few minutes before.  It was walking up the hill to the top of the RR tracks. We were about 110 feet away. It had its head bent down and turned sideways toward us but never stopped walking straight across the tracks and down the other side.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After parking their car at the local garbage dump they went down to the creek with their nets to see if the smelt were running.  Smelt are a small 7- 9\" fish that were introduced to the inland waters as food for stocked salmon and soon escaped to Lake Michigan.They named \"it\" the Marblehead Monster, named after the Marblehead Creek and Marblehead Swamp nearby.  They had never heard of bigfoot or sasquatch - not in 1962.  They had heard of the abominable snowman but he was too far away, in the Himalayas.The witness got the impression that the guttural growl was not a threat, more like a \"call\". The face and hands appeared muddy but were still lighter in color and stood out from the dark brown hair.  The body was very muscular, not skinny and very thick.  Estimated to be 7 - 8' tall, 400 lbs. and close enough to throw a baseball and hit it. The UP of Michigan in 1962 was absolutely full of wildlife. The amount of food, cover and options available to sustain such a creature are bountiful, to say the least.",
