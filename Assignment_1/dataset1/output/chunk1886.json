            "Follow-Up Report": "Google Earth map of the location:The following are photos from the witness of the tracks they found at the waterway when they were looking for confirmation and from when the witness returned Monday with his girlfriend, several with his girlfriend's foot for comparison: Met with the two witnesses on Saturday, December 19th at approximately 1 pm, both appearing trustworthy and honest.  Very believable in relaying their observations through their week of hunting.We met at the intersection of Pleasant Valley Church Road and Pleasant Valley Cemetery Road.  There is an abandoned church and another building along with a parking area so that people can walk down to the water.  We then proceeded to walk down to the water.  It was a dry sand bar due to the lake being lowered for the winter.  Photo of the lake:I observed two separate trackways.  The first being a short set of approximately 5 noticeable footprints, but due to the time and weather conditions they were nothing more than foot shaped indentations in the sand.  Photo taken of this first trackway:Photo of a track with my foot for comparison:The second trackway was on the other side of the inlet.I saw several foot shaped tracks that walked out into the water and then another set came back towards the shore.  There was ice on the water so the tracks could only be viewed for a short distance.Freshwater Mussels are found all through the waterways of North America. In fact, there are well over 300 types, and roughly 150 of those are found in the Ohio rivers. They are a favorite food of herons, raccoons, and possums. Empty mussel shells like this one were found in and around the inlet:I took this photo, what appears to be a 3-toed track is most likely a partial heel print with three deer prints, good example of how tracks can appear to be something else:We did go up to the spot where the camper was parked.  It looks out over the valley and the surrounding areas.  To the south is a large junk yard and to the northeast is the inlet.  Photos of the campsite:From talking with the witnesses for almost two hours on a cold day in December, I do not believe they would waste their time or mine for a hoax, and their stories never changed.Dillon State Park is in an area of the state that has diverse and unique natural features. One of which is the Black Hand Sandstone. Sand, eroded hundreds of millions of years ago from mountains farther east, accumulated in a vast delta in the sea covering the region. This hard bedrock erodes to form sheer cliffs and supports a hardwood forest.The farmland and waters of the Dillon area help support the wildlife including white-tailed deer.",

I had just come out of the Cocrine hill section of the highway.  I was going around a sharp curve in the highway, and had my high beams on in my truck.  As I rounded the curve I saw a tall human like form take 2 or 3 steps onto the edge of the road, and then spot as if to wait for traffic to clear.  I slowed way down to see if it was someone needing a ride.  As I got next to the big foot i noticed that the creature was around 8 to 9 feet tall, and was covered head to toe in long black fur. I got scared, and being alone I stepped on the gas, and stopped 5 miles or so down the road to process what I had just seen.  The big foot also had arms that hung lower, and longer than that of humans.",
