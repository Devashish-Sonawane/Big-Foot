The track line came across the lake, from east to west, in 1.5 feet deep snow and was about 1/2 mile in length across the lake. The trail line then came ashore, went up to and around a cabin and through the woods: The trail line then proceeded south towards Turtle Lake Road, and as it neared the road the creature appeared to jump the embankment and up onto the road, and the trail disappeared on the road.  The trackbed itself was about 1/2 mile long in total length.  Individual toe indentations were clearly visible in the footprints: Bill stated that there had been other reports in the area throughout the fall and winter including a sighting near his cabin, and several possible sightings near Marcell, Minnesota this fall including an incident where there was a sighting near town, then a short time later a sighting on a highway a short distance from town.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "In addition to the report, this individual is involved in the research of Sasquatch and uses his own audio equipment to gather audio evidence.  Further details: It was hard to tell the length of the arm, especially with the movement of it swinging down. There was no odd smell. Other than the initial movement sounds no other sounds were made when it was leaving the area.  The area is heavily wooded with trees and brush and is along the Missouri River which separates the Iowa and Nebraska state lines. There are many ravines, farms and prairie areas plus a abundance of wildlife: deer, rabbits, squirrels, birds and fish in the river.I find the witness to be credible. He has attended many BFRO Expeditions and has for several years been doing audio placement to get audio evidence for the research of Sasquatch.____________________________________________________[Matt Moneymaker's notes:This is the type of area in the Midwest where Sasquatches will find refuge in the Winter and early Spring. In those seasons they will seek dense brush cover ideally the gullies of hilly terrain.  Dense brushy zones in the gullies of hilly terrain is the best natural protection from freezing winds unless you're inside a cave or burrow, etc. In late Spring through early Fall there is enough cover, in the form of growing corn, for Sasquatches to venture far out from their Winter/Spring strongholds.  They can stay out there among cornfields and not return at night to a naturally brushy zone but the Omaha Indian's in contact with the BFRO say they have encounters almost year round in some part of the bluffs overlooking the Missouri River Basin so this one (and its family) may be sticking around most of the time because of the abundance of deer within nightly walking distance of the hilly bluff zone.",
