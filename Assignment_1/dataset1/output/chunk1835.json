She woke up hearing the \"laughter\" which she estimates lasted about 5 minutes and seemed to be from one individual.There was only one older couple camped nearby to the east and then a few others further east, the campground was not crowded.  They don't know if anyone else heard it.  This night was very quiet but the previous night a boy scout troop was camped there and was quite noisy. The troop left due to rain.",

            "Observed": "I was hunting for Whitetailed deer through the forests and swamps of Northwestern Minnesota.  As I entered another peice of woods after crossing a swamp I jumped a deer.  It ran off a few jumps and stopped.  I raised my gun and fired.  Misfire!  Off the deer went into the woods along with the confidence I had in my weapon and ammunition.  I proceded through the heavy underbrush until I came into a clearing.  As I entered the clearing I glanced left then right.  On my left I saw a \"man\" hunch his shoulders, duck his head and turn away from me.  As I looked right I realized I had seen the figure of a man on my left.  When I turned back I saw the back of a dark head and shoulders disappear into the hazelnut brush.  I then realized that any man out in the woods on opening day of deer season would have been wearing an orange hat and coat, while this one was clad in dark brown/black.  I was certain what I had seen was a bigfoot.  I thought about looking for tracks, then remembered my gun had just let me down while trying to shoot a deer, so I made tracks in the opposite direction of this creature.  I returned to our hunting shack in this area many times but never went back to that part of the swamp.  In the many trips back to Middle River and NW MN I never saw anything like this again.",
