            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness\u0092s annual trips to this area include camping, huckleberry picking in the meadows and hills close-by and the pursuit of his lifelong hobby as a rail fan. Employed nearly 20 years in a government position, his interests include musical instruments, railroad history and outdoor pursuits. He has perfect pitch and in his spare time tunes pianos.My investigation took me to the area for a look about, which lasted from mid-afternoon until well into the evening. I was able to hike the area in daylight and get a good feel of the topography and the surroundings. During my afternoon on the hillside south of camp, not more than a half mile away, I found and photographed a possible footprint.The impression was in hard packed soil heading uphill. It was surrounded by bracts of a fir tree, which littered large areas of the forest floor. Another possible partial print was visible above this one and measured at a 44 inch stride. The photo shows a possible print that is 17 inches long. It would be seven inches wide at the ball and four inches wide at the heel.The location is 2,200 feet above sea level and sits in a small valley on the approach to Stevens Pass. It is one of the major east-west routes through the Cascade Mountain Range. Working their way up the mountain grade are US Highway 2 and the main line of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad. The Tye River flows here, fed by numerous streams. Several abandoned railroad tunnels dot the hillside and would make excellent shelter from harsh wintry conditions. The Stevens Pass corridor has had a wide variety of bigfoot related incidents over the years.I stayed in the area well past dark. Nothing out of the ordinary occurred that night.Link to BFRO Report 2602:  Loud vocalizations heard near Stevens PassReport #2602",
