            "Follow-Up Report": "[Update by Matt Moneymaker]This sketch was provided by one of the witnesses. It is a better depiction of their face structure than you will see in most sketches, which are typically made by non-witness artists. The depiction of the eyes -- the big, dark, spooky, wide-open  eyes -- is right on. Sasquatches do not have a squinting appearance, like people who spend most of their waking hours in direct sunlight. Sasquatch eyes are big, dark and always wide, wide open, as you see in this witness sketch. As they grow older their brow ridge protrudes a bit more, making their eyes appear more sunken, but still big, black and wide open. There is something owl-like about their expression, something that strongly speaks of a nocturnal lifestyle. They look as though they are built for the night. [Original interview by Kathy Moskowitz]I spoke with the witness by phone.  The following details can be added to the report:The family owned 12 acres of very wooded, undeveloped land off of State Highway 229.  There had never been any incidents prior to this date, until the land owner behind this property began clearing his land.  When the kids were walking down the footpath, the witness was the first to see the bigfoot, about 15-20 yards away.  The bigfoot appeared to be a female with a small juvenile with her.  The juvenile appeared scared, and had his head snuggled close into his mother's side, his arms around her waist.  When she saw them, she took a step toward them, bared her teeth and growled/grunted at them.  The kids panicked and started running through the trees.  The bigfoot chased them back to the trailer, all the while screaming and beating trees with what sounded like branches in order to intimidate them.  A very detailed description of the female includes:--she had a coconut-shaped head, brows were protruded;--hair over her body was short, but thick;--her breasts were large, and not covered by hair, their skin was gray-black;--her legs were as big around as tree trunks and her arms the size of a man's leg;--her knees and elbows were calloused and devoid of skin;--her eyes were coal black, no whites in the eyes at all;--hair covered face up to cheek bones; nose, eyes and cheeks were devoid of hair;  --Patterson file was very close, but eyes in this experience seemed larger.Other incidents: their water pump was damaged; they found dead, mutilated deer hanging in trees that had been ripped open and their necks broken (possibly stashed there for later use?); and they found some structures that resembled stick igloos, covered with leaves and other waste material that smelled very bad (appeared to be habitation structures)._________________________________________________",
