These noises were very loud, and highpitched. Until recently I've always wondered what these noises were. I was watching A&E In Search Of, Bigfoot, they were audio taping trails where bigfoot was sighted. I was shocked when they played these tapes. They sounded exactly the same. An experience like this will really wake you up. This is no bull, people laugh, make jokes but its true.",

            "Observed": "It was a moon lit night just about dusk a friend and I had gone to a party but it was a bust. When we got to the place out of town. I took off by myself down the road towards the East back to Route 70 to wait. I had been walking for about 25-30 minutes when the wind shifted from the South. I smelled something awful a cross between a skunk and rotten flesh, like something died. As I was walking along the South side of the road I noticed someone walking about 300-400 feet away along the edge of the woods on the South side of pasture. I thought it was kind of late for a farmer to be bringing his cows in as they were in a big hurry to get away from him. About that time I heard a God Awful blood curdling scream which I thought was the cattle screaming. I stopped to look accross at the farmer and he also stopped and stood still looking at me, which I considered odd. As I continued East I watched as he matched my every move and would stop and stare when I did. The cows were gone buy now and the stench was getting stronger as what I thought was a man angeled his way closer to me. I stopped and stared right at the thing ( at that point I knew it was not a man as it was only walking and I was almost running ) it was coming straight for me. It stood close to eleven foot tall and was covered with thick matted redish brown hair.",
