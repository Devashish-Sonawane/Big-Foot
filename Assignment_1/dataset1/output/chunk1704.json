            "Observed": "When I was a boy, about 10 years ago, I was walking in the snow one morning on my Grandmother's farm.  I came across some footprints in the snow that would be appoximately the size and shape of an adult human's foot, but with one exception.  Both feet had only four toes. The area is rural, but is populated and this particular area is in an open field that is in plain view of a well-traveled road.  Similar tracks appeared in the snow the following year.  Unfortunately I was too young to drive to the store for film and no one else in my family seemed to care about my findings.  Several years later, approximately 1993-1994, I had another strange experience on our small farm.  I never connected the two events until reading some other stories on your web-site.  One night I stepped out of our house into the car-port.  The car-port was brightly illuminated, but none of the other exterior lights were on.  This made it impossible to see outides the perimiter of the car-port.  As I stepped out of the house, something screamed at me from the darkness, a screma like I had never heard.  It was not human, it was too wild, but it sounded more human than animal.  It seemed to be both a warning and a scream of terror.  I was told that it was probably a wildcat, but never believed it to sound like a cat at all.  I wasn't aware that screaming was associated with bigfoot.  I am now wondering if the number of toes I mentioned earlier is in order?",
