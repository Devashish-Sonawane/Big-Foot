            "Observed": "In connection with report #8804, my house is approximately 5 miles south of this sighting.  Throughout the spring of 2004, our neighborhood was disturbed regularly by something walking through the woods at night.  Almost everyone in the neighborhood was affected, in that we would hear footsteps, twigs snapping, and one neighbor heard scratching on the side of the house.  Outside my kitchen window, which is about 8 feet off the ground, the plants are all smashed down like something repeatedly stood there.  My neighbor sleeps with his bedroom windows open and hears it approaching in the middle of the night.  The dogs in the area would absolutely go nuts!  He has night vision and just as soon as he gets outside, he hears the footsteps slowly moving away.  He never picked up anything on the nightvision.  In May 2004 I came home late, about midnight, and as I was exiting the car, I heared a the classic bigfoot scream way out in the distance, maybe half a mile away.  In July, it all suddenly ended and we haven't heard anything since.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The area of the activity is mostly hardwood forests interspersed with farms of various sizes.  There are many tobacco farms in the area.  Streams and ponds are abundant.  There are quite a few houses, but the acreage per lot is quite largeOn more than one occasion throughout the spring of 2004, the witness and his neighbors heard a two-footed creature walking through the woods.  Dogs in the area would seemingly respond simultaneously to the animal by barking incessantly.  In the words of the witness, \u0093The dogs would go ape.\u0094The witness did hear a scream one night that sounded very similar to a purported Bigfoot vocalization he had heard played on the Art Bell show.  This scream came from a large wooded area (approximately 30 acres) in the back of his neighbor\u0092s property.Neighbors in the area were also disturbed and had called the police to investigate.  Nothing was found.  Another neighbor with night vision gear was unable to identify the source of the sounds.  The witness agreed to ask the neighbor if he would be willing to speak with me.There is no resident black bear population in Orange County.  Over a thirty year period, the NC Wildlife Resources Commission reported one verified black bear sighting in the county.I asked if any other animal could have been responsible for the disturbances.  The witness said, \u0093No way.  The only other thing it could have possibly been was a person.\u0094  The witness is positive it was two-footed.  He is also familiar with the sounds of other animals.  The duration of the activity (i.e. months) and its unusual nature leads the witness to consider that possibility to be negligible.  Residents do not enter the woods except in the fall for hunting season.  The witness also said, \u0093There is zero chance of this being a prank or a joke.\u0094The witness recently read report 8804 for Person County, which is relatively close to his residence.  The proximity of that sighting and the unexplained disturbances in the spring prompted him to submit his report.  Activity abruptly stopped in July, but the witness will contact me if the disturbances resume.",

            "Observed": "ME my husband our two children and dog.  Were camping in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest In Arizona.  Right by Bear Canyon Lake at the end of Forest Road 9018. Saturday Morning I went for a walk with my morning coffee. I crossed a  fence looking for the lake. It was are first time camping at Bear Canyon lake and I knew the lake was close.  100 yards from the fence I saw a large mound of feces that was steaming.  It scared me, I knew what ever made that huge dropping was still very close because of the heat coming off of it.  I ran back to my camp site and thought it must have been a bear. I was thank full that the fence was between what ever it was and me.  Sunday morning about 4:00AM my entire family was awoken by a loud howling, screaming, growl. It yelled several times maybe 10 or 12 It was so scary I lost count I thought it would never end. The howling screams made the coyotes go crazy.  it was so close to are camp sight maybe 150 yards away in a sloping north east area of the forest.  We laid there as quite and still as possible waiting for day light.  Their were two more camping sights not to far from us but by the time we packed up and went to talk to the people at the other sights they had already left.  The only sound I could find on your sight that sounded close to the sound were form California the 1993 Del Norte recording. The sounds we heard  were angry or like it was injured or mad.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Monday, 8/7/06.  I spoke with the witness today and found a person who did her research.  She contacted the local forest service to ask what could make such a sound, the answer was elk or a mountain lion, maybe an owl.  She didn't believe any of these animals could make such a loud, angry sounding call so she searched the internet listening to animal calls including the three mentioned. She could not find anything close to what they experienced.  The best match was an alleged bigfoot vocalization.A few details to add to her report;The fresh feces she found on top of a low cut stump Saturday morning looked to her like a very large human made it.  She has seen cattle feces which is big enough but not the same form and there were no cattle around.  It didn't occur to her until after the next mornings vocalization incident that the feces and the vocalization may have been from the same animal.The vocalizations around 4AM Sunday lasted about 3 seconds each with about 30 seconds between calls.  She said the calls were a variable screaming, growling vocalization from a large source that sounded angry.  They were camping in a tent at a dispersed site (not a campground) and she said even in an RV the sounds would have been loud.  She felt the source was close perhaps 150 yards away.  Even though there was nearly a full moon to see outside nobody volunteered to go have a look.Saturday night around 10PM  they heard what sounded like rocks clacking and wood knocking.  ",
