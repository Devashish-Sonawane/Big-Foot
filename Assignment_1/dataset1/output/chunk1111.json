            "Observed": "While riding 4wheelers my wife and I and another couple decided to follow the railroad tracks to the next town. It was about a ten mile treck that goes through swamp and none of which is developed. I have never followed it before at night. At about halfway to the other town (Meldrim,Ga.) it looked as though the light at the far end of the tracks was getting brighter.We pulled off the side and backed up to the ditch that parallels the railroad bed to wait to see if the light got brighter.While waiting my wife and friends sat and talked and I climbed back onto the tracks on foot to watch the light. The plan was to wait ten minutes and if it didn't get brighter it was possibly a light from another source. After about five minutes my wife and her friend heard something moving progressively closer in the woods. Then large objects began falling around us. I looked at everyone asked had they heard it , then there was no doubt. Larger objects started coming down -large rocks ,large limbs. Many were landing in the water, not all in the same place , not all the same size, making huge splashes like bricks would make or larger. One then two,then multiple large things landing on both sides and on top of the tracks. Everyone with me by then was right beside me and none of them were playing a joke. Something was throwing stuff at us from the woods. I kept shining my flashlight but never saw what. These were big objects and there is no way any animal I am familliar with could have done this. I have hunted all my life and stay in the woods all the time but this truly freaked me out. As a side note when I used to stay with a friend at his house near the tracks on the Bloomingdale end his grandad used to tell us of howls that came from the woods down the swamp that he couldnt explain. He said they would sound like screaming I've always been skeptical of that but now I am not so sure.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "     After speaking to the witness to this incident by phone, I can add a few details to this report.  The witness described himself as an experienced outdoorsman who has hunted all of his life, but he was unable to put his finger on what could have been throwing objects at the group that night.  He spoke credibly and directly as he related the incident to me.     The two couples were riding two four-wheelers, traveling west from Bloomingdale to Meldrim, and pulled off the railroad tracks when they saw lights in the distance to determine whether they were coming from a community ahead, or from an approaching train.     After remaining stationary for a minute, the group began to hear something moving around in the woods on the south side of the tracks, and also began to hear objects landing nearby that they realized were being thrown in their direction.  The witness described fist-sized rocks, and sticks as large as a man's arm landing around them, on the railroad tracks, and in the water of a ditch which was next to them.  After determining the objects were getting too close for comfort, the group decided to leave immediately.",
