I was awakened abruptly out of a deep sleep when a very loud animal scream made me sit straight up in bed, scaring the hell out of me.  For about 15-20 seconds I wondered if maybe I had imagined it, when suddenly another long, loud screaming came.  It was very loud- and close, and it was obvious by the volume and intensity that it was something big.  I guessed the screaming to be about 10-20 feet away from the house, outside my bedroom, on the lawn.  There is roughly 60 feet of lawn between the house and the woods and the screaming sounded like it was maybe one-quarter to one-third away from the house towards the woods.",
