What I saw was a large black head and shoulders coming over the guardrail on the south side of the road. As I came to a stop, I turned on the highbeams and saw the creature step easily over the guardrail. It was about 8 feet tall with a kind of shiney black hair covering most of its body.",

An hour or so later I walked back there to see how he was doing.  I heard what sounded like logs being thrown around and I thought it to be strange, like what the hell is he building.  The area is real thick with under growth and trees both living and dead so to get my direction straight I hollered his name.  The sound stopped and I hollered several times only to hear silence.  I remember feeling odd at that time.  I continued forward into the swamp, I was looking down to avoid tripping on debri and I saw for only a second something big move across in between two big bush type trees in front of me.  It didn't make hardly any noise though, it was very light on it's feet not like you would think for something of it's size.  So this part of my story is just odd, not like an actual sighting.  But I do believe (what I saw in February) was a bigfoot.",

My wife and I purchased our home near Kingston, Michigan in Febuary of 1999.  We were having coffee in the morning on a weekend, date I cannot recall but it was shortly after, still in February.  As we were having our coffee I was looking off into the woods behind our home and saw a tall pitch black \"ape\" walking from south to the north.  It was erect, however slightly leaning forward, not straight up.  It's arms were long and just kinda swinging loosely as it passed.  It traveled about twenty feet in my view.  I saw only it's right side.  My wife did not see it and it is really hard for her to take me serious.  I don't blame her though.  There was some snow on the ground but very scant.  No foot prints.  Ground was frozen.  I was going to investigate packing my 9mm but took something with more power because this thing was huge.",

We spent close to an hour discussing his sighting and other area activity.       The Thumb area of Michigan is flat, filled with farms and small towns.  At first glance, it would not appear to be an area where one would expect any BF sightings.  However, it is an area with much reported activity over many years.",
