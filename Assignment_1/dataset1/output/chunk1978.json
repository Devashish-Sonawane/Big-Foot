So prior to this experience I had visited this place twice and this slope top only once. I was just leaving this nest when doing a check up, I found the eggs predated (common), and the nest destroyed (uncommon), it was torn like something grabbed the side of the nest along with the eggs. Nothing was found on the ground.",

I searched for bird nests in this forest for a total of 3 months June-August Monday-Friday. I was dropped off to search for nests in my assigned plot. This was a mature forest with large mature trees. The trees were mainly Red Maple, American Beech, and similar species. The ground cover had a thick layer of leaves and some sparse vegetation, some downed logs, rocks etc. The tree canopy was thick and let in little light. I was dropped off at this site at 6:30am. The weather was overcast, gray and a slight rain fall.",

The trail itself is nestled in between two rather steep mountainsides with a small stream running down the center, parallel to the trail.  Forest is primary evergreen, with some Aspens.  It's a very moist area, with a large amount of moss on trees and on the ground.  The mountain ridge is primarily on the left side of the trail, but the outcropping we chose to sit on was the lone such structure on the right of the trail.  To explain the topography, the left side of the trail is very rocky, steep, and culminates with a ridgeline.  The right is more shadowed, had large amounts of moss and evergreens, and is exceptionally steep, but not rocky.",
