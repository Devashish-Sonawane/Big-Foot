            "Observed": "In the spring of 2006 several members of the county\u0092s development review team (planners, engineers and legal) were invited to tour a 90,000 acre ranch that was proposed for development.  The intent was to give the reviewers a \u0093base-line\u0094 as to existing conditions, identify areas to be developed  and areas proposed to be established as a nature preserve. The developer provided a \u0093swamp buggy\u0094 for the tour.  It was an  old, modified (top removed) school bus with large tires.  It maneuvered around the ranch, much of which was swamp, for a little more than two hours. The ranch extremely active with wildlife \u0085 the fields and pastures with deer and wild pigs; the swamp with large birds and dozens of gators.  Although the ranch was laced with timber and crop roads, many were flooded from a very wet winter / spring and therefore the swamp buggy was forced to take routes not often traveled.  Near the end of the tour about two miles from the ranch\u0092s bunk houses and barns,  the driver had to tap his breaks to avoid a family of wild hogs (2 large and 3 small).  The guide, who was also the ranch manager, mentioned the wildlife was much more active than usual, offering that it was because of the heavy rains and flooded areas \u0085  joking that \u0093we even brought out the three little pigs for you.\u0094  I was sitting next to where the guide was standing and I said \u0093yeah, you even provided a gorilla\u0094. He looked down at me but said nothing as I pointed out of the bus across a flooded area to a small rise, maybe 150 yards away.  He said nothing so I let it drop.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a retired city planner now residing in NC. His view of the animal was totally unobstructed. No trees or bushes were between him and the animal. It was out in a large fields that floods during the rainy season. It was actually on a small rise so he had a clear view of it for 3-5 seconds.This ranch is a working ranch/farm that grows many varieties of fruits and vegetables. It also attracts dozens of wild pigs and deer. This property would be a great food source for any large animal. The witness described the creature as quite stocky in build, 7 - 7 1/2 ft in height, covered in dark brown hair. It was reaching up into a (fruit) tree when he first saw it. No facial features could be discerned. It appeared to be holding (cradling) something in its arm. He thought it could have been an armful of fruit or some other produce it may have been collecting.  He made the following two sketches, he added the facial features for reference. I inquired about the 2nd witness and he doesn't know his whereabouts.I spoke with the witness several times. He seemed credible and honest in each telling of the story. Since his sighting was in broad daylight and unobstructed, and the fact he was a high ranking city planner with no reason to fabricate a story that might tarnish a distinguished career, I have no reason to believe he saw anything other than what he described.
