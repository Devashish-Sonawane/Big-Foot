            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness does not recall the exact date the sighting occurred.  She estimates the time of the sighing to be between 6:00 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. because she was heading home from work. The witness had stopped her vehicle at the rail crossing before crossing the tracks.  As she looked to the west she saw a large, dark figure approximately 100 yards away.  She at first thought it to be a bear but quickly realized that it could not because it was walking on two legs and, to her knowledge, there have never been bear sightings  in the area.The witness only viewed the animal for a couple of seconds.  It had already crossed the tracks and was heading into a brush line that ran parallel with the railroad tracks.  She described it as tall, entirely covered with long hair and one arm swung as it walked.  She does not believed it looked at her nor could she discern other features given the distance and her state of fright and anxiety.Later she realized that if the animal continued to walk in its direction of travel it would emerged from the brush line into an open field and then cross Rt 31 (aprox. 400 yards from the bush line, due North).  Therefore, other people should have seen it from the highway.  However, it is possible that the animal did not cross the field but walked along the brush line.The Witness lives in the area, not far from the sighting.  As recently as this past summer and fall she has heard strange vocalizations at night (11:00 p.m. and later) that she can not identify.",

I sat watched for a little while and a very very large dark cone headed type person animal whatever you want to call it took a step and was in the middle of the road.  It just stood there like it was watching me watching it. It stood there for a few mins and turned and walked across the street into underbrush and trees over by the creek.  I waited a little longer and it never came back out so I went to work.  This started a sort of strange animals being seen around here and heard.  My father claimed to keep seeing a very large brownish black bear across the street. The next door neighbors grandson was playing in the back yard and came around front and told us there was a big gorilla in the backyard.  The sound I have heard at night is a cross between a scream, howl and growl and some nights you can smell a very heavy wet  dog smell with a hint of mildew mixed in.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After phone interviews and an extensive on-site investigation, I\u0092ve come to the conclusion this report is accurate.  The following can be added:The witness was 100 yards from the creature during the sighting.The creature was approximately 9\u00926\u0094 tall standing in the slumped position and 4\u00926\u0094 wide at the shoulders.It covered the 10 feet from the middle of the road to the edge in one and a quarter steps.The embankment it was standing on before jumping onto the road was about 4 feet above the road.  It leaped across the ditch and to the middle of the road, a distance of 20 feet, from a standing position and without moving beforehand.  The leap was in a one-foot forward style.  It landed standing.The color was very dark/black with a dark face.  The hair was 6\u0094 long and very matted with long, matted clumps hanging from the arms.  The hands reached the knees.The hands were human like and the fingers were spread apart.Muscles could not be seen for the thick, long, matted hair.The estimated time the creature stood in the middle of the road before it walked off was 10 seconds.The sun was up, but still low. It was just after the spring time change.I found 2 identical stick structures up the steep hill in the woods behind the witness\u0092 house.  The first one was about 200 yards away and was most likely intentionally built.  The second one was about 300 yards away and was also built intentionally.  There was not a single stick on the ground within 25 yards of the second one.  The 2 were in alignment with the north and south boundaries of the houses below.  Both pointed due south.The creature would have easy access to about 50 square miles of mostly unpopulated, heavily-wooded rolling hills with bluffs and lakes.Activities include rocks being thrown onto the roof and metal fence posts being pulled straight up out of the ground.Increased activity started when the witness moved her horses to another location and quit putting out oats, apples, and other foods.",
