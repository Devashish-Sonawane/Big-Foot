            "Follow-Up Report": "We met with the witness (JR) at his friends home. He seemed honest and sincere in his retelling of events. JR and a man he was doing work for were standing on an elevated section of property looking down at a pond. This was a small pond of approximately 2 acres. Directly behind the pond is a deeply wooded area that changes to a pine forest, then ends at a large clearing. JR was making this pond bigger so the landowner could stock it with fish. As they were quietly discussing the job, the landowner noticed a dark, large figure walking through the pine forest behind the pond. Since there was little to no underbrush, they could see it clearly as it walked on two legs for approximately 100 ft through the trees, but when it reached the end of the pines where it should have walked out into the open, it could no longer be seen. They waited for some time, but finally their curiosity drove them to walk down and see for themselves where this animal went to. Thinking it had hunkered down or was hiding behind a tree, they slowly entered the area, but found that it was no longer there. Footprints were not found either as the ground was covered in pine needles. The men judged the height of the creature at 8-9 feet tall by the 4 foot fence behind the forest. It walked casually, as in no hurry, and didn't seem to be aware that the men were watching it. As a side observation, a few years later, JR's son was fishing in the same pond, when a rock came from the wooded area and splashed into the pond in front of him. He said it wasn't a fish as he saw the rock come from the woods. This is the same area that both men lost eight goats from a fenced in enclosure a few years prior to the sighting. These goats were inside a 4 ft hog wire enclosure with a single strand of barbed wire above that. JR said something would have to lift them over the fence to get them out, There was no blood, hair, or sign of struggle ever found. They disappeared one by one over several months. The only animal near to the pond now is the landowners' horse that will not stay down there after dusk. It always heads back up to the barn at the first sign of nightfall. ",
