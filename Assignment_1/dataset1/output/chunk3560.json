            "Follow-Up Report": "This report was occasioned by the witness having a conversation with a relative who had an experience in Alaska that could be assigned to a sasquatch. He mentioned that the kids were walked during the day around the perimeter of the camp, probably to dispel any apprehension about the forest environment, but it gave them all a chance to observe the ample number of footprints. The tipped-over evergreen tree, its root upturned, was thick from the perspective of a 12-year old (\"might not have gotten my arms around it\").Nevertheless, the camp was terminated much earlier than planned. He suspects that there must have been dozens of eye witnesses that looked out during the uproar, except that in those days sasquatch or bigfoot was not a commonly recognized entity nor was there any convenient venue for reporting encounters. This event may have been caused by the camp having been recently completed and by the noise made by the campers during this first-time occupancy.The witness has the additional hope that other members of that camp at the time might read this report and come forward with their stories.",

Something came running through camp and made the strangest yell I've ever heard.

We all wondered if it could be what we thought but needed the meat we were after worse. We just kind of left it at that and use it to scare visiting relatives.",
