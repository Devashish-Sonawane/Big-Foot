Your not up to high, but you can look down into the rivers. It's in Pacific Co but pretty close to Lewis Co border.",

            "Observed": "It was a friday, April 20th 2001. I was doing salmon Habitat surveys for the Dept of Fish and Wildlife. My partner and I had gone up to do our Steelhead index in Fall river. He had dropped me off on the 7000 bridge to walk my 1/2 mile section while he drove to mid point and walked lower section where Boss creek comes in. I finished my section of the stream and drove down the 7083 to where the road ends to pick him up. It was probably around 11 or 11:30. I got out of the truck to pour myself some coffee when i heard this loud scream. i heard it twice and it sounded almost like my partner was calling my name. Con...nie!!!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I communicated with the witness, Connie, by phone and email numerous times and found her to be entirely credible.The sequence of events indicate that at the confluence of Fall River and Boss Creek, where she parked, Connie heard what was probably the killing of a deer below her down along the Fall River. Then as Tom walked the river toward Connie's location, he came upon the steaming, freshly mangled remains and splattered blood located on and around the trail he planned to use to exit the river and meet Connie. Concerned, Tom then continued up the river to exit at another location. The blood trail from the kill showed that something carried half of the deer across the road not far from the vehicle, but Connie did not see it. She may have been looking the other way and did not hear it due to the river noise or because she was inside the vehicle. Tom and Connie filed reports of the incident with details of what they observed and heard with the Director of the Fish Program for the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Connie confirmed that what Tom wrote in his report was the same as what he explained seeing to her immediately after the incident. Connie shared that this section of the river was known among her fellow fish surveyors for giving them the creeps as moaning sounds and movement through the brush were often heard.It would be very unusual behavior for a black bear or cougar to rip a freshly killed adult deer in half immediately after killing it, and it's questionable if they even could. Even if a bear or cougar did succeed in dividing the deer, it would drag the half carcass to a safe location away from the vehicle and Connie, not toward her. Descriptions from the event as heard by Connie and seen by Tom indicate that at least one sasquatch was likely involved.  ",

            "Observed": "The six of us, my boyfriend, my children, another couple and me, stopped at a boat rental tourist trap on Lake Livingston. The guys we were with went in and rented two boats for a couple of hours while we waited outside.While on the lake I felt like someone was watching me, I quickly turned around to look into the eyes of a large black hairy creature approximately 8 or 9 feet tall that was standing at the edge of the lake right next to the waters edge looking right back at me. Although I was staring right at the creatures face I could barely see its' eyes due to the extreme amount of hair. Its body was huge and block like. For a few brief seconds we stared at each other then suddenly the creatures turned to its right and took one step and went crashing through the trees which shook even the very tallest trees and sent the birds panicking into flight. Being stunned as to what I saw I hesitated to tell the others what I had seen. But I did tell the others and asked them to take me to where I had seen the ape like creature and let me out to see if I could see any footprints. They too had heard the creature crashing through the trees and believed that I had seen something and wouldn't let me get out and search for evidence.",
