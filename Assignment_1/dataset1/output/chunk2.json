            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness one day after the reported incident. The witness stated while descending from the summit of Mt. Greylock, he and his wife were walking the Cheshire Harbor Trail. They were about a 100 yards down from Rockville Road. They were the only two on the trail at that point.  No one else was in visual range.  They both heard a clapping noise coming from about a 100 feet from the trail line to their left. The stopped and listened. He described the noise like two cupped hands clapping together. The noise was not very loud and non rhythmic.  He attempted to reproduce the noise using rocks and sticks, however it was his cupped hands clapping that mimicked the sound more closely.While listening they heard what they described as foot steps and stick snapping, compared to someone walking on forest debris. They continued on down the trail after a few minutes with no other incidents. They did pass several other hikers that were ascending shortly after experiencing the noises.Both witnesses are avid hikers and outdoors enthusiast. The male witnesses states he has been interested in the Sasquatch mystery for many years and enjoys following the information available. He also states other members of his family having encounters over the years in New York State. The witness was polite and thorough with recalling his incident. He spoke without hesitation and was happy someone reached out to him in a timely manner. He and his wife will continue to hike the area and report back any new findings. He was encouraged to carry a personal recorder and to keep a journal. Mt. Greylock is the highest peak with a elevation of 3491ft and the first state park created in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  It is home to some of the states old growth forests and numerous recreational trails, including a section of the Appalachian Trail. The Mountain is located in the North West corner of the state and has been referenced by writers such as Melville, Hawthorne, Thoreau and others. There are plenty of fresh water sources and abundant wildlife. This mountain chain connects to The Green Mountains of Vermont as well as the neighboring New York Adirondacks. We have has several recent reports from the Berkshires. We will continue to monitor the area and report our findings. On a side note, Adams, the Town where Mt. Greylock is located, is this investigators home town, I am very familiar with this location and hiked the trails most of my years living there. I am aware of multiple suspected sasquatch encounters in this area over the years",
