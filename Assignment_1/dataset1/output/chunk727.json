            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness several times about this incident and have been to the site quite a few times. The area has been one of study for BFRO researchers for the last several months. Further, it has a history of reports of aural and visual encounters with creatures that meet the description of sasquatches. The witness candidly described the whoops that she and others heard as sounding identical to the recorded whoops on the BFRO site. The vocalizations made quite an impression on the witness, as she went from being a skeptical professional to a credulous professional. She had heard of other encounters in the area, but tended to dismiss them. After this incident, she began to seriously ponder the validity of these animals, as the whoops she heard were close and demanding of attention. Others in the witness's family have heard the so-called \"Ohio Howl\" in the area. Another field researcher and I also heard the howl just a few miles south of where the witness was camping. Both of us estimated that we were within 100 yards of the animal. It was loud and intimidating. The witness, who was once a genuine skeptic, now thinks that there is perhaps a small group of these elusive animals who frequently pass through the area. She bases her assumption on her experience and the experiences of family members and others. ",
