            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on the phone for nearly two hours, on Monday, March 6, 2006. The witness seemed very credible and was able to recall great detail.The witness had taken a wrong turn, and was going back toward the Jarrel Cove camping area. \"The road splits and I had went the wrong way, towards a housing development. I turned around and had gotten on the right road,\" he described.His highbeams caught a large bipedal animal on the right side of the road. Its side was turned towards him. He saw it take one step with its right leg, to climb up the hill. The witness is most amazed at the muscle mass of the creature. \"Its hair wasn't shaggy. I would guess about two inches long. Similar to a buffalo hide,\" he stated. \"I couldn't see skin, but you could still see muscle tone.\" The witness could see hamstring and gluteus muscles through the fur. He was also impressed with the muscle form and width in the shoulders. \"It had no neck; just complete trapezius from head to shoulder\" the witness said.The arms were also noticably long. He stated \"Tips of fingers on humans come down to mid-thigh, but these came down to right above the knee.\"When asked about its body position, he said it was standing straight up and down; \"The same posture as you and me if we were about to climb a hill. It climbed up the hill like it was nothing.\" The witness estimates the height to be seven to eight feet. He figures that, based on size and muscle, it must have been a male.The witness was driving a full size diesel truck, going about 20 to 25 mph, and figures the creature was about 100 feet away from vehicle - \"Just caught in my high beams.\"When describing the animal, he says \"It was a cross between a gorilla and human. Too massive to be human.\" The sighting only lasted five seconds, he estimates....Their destination; Jarrel Cove State Park, was about ten minutes away. They found a camping spot, parked and walked a short ways to pay for their spot. That is when the witness and his cousin first heard what he believes was a sasquatch howl. \"It was a long, drawn-out 'Whoooooooooooo!,\" he describes. His cousin does not believe at all in bigfoot, and dismissed it as a wolf.They camped in the back canopy of his truck. While his cousin was sleeping, at around 1:30 to 2am the witness heard more calls. These were long, drawn-out calls, fifteen to twenty seconds long, with no pitch changes. \"Very constant, perfect pitch,\" he described. He compared these calls to the Mt. Baker recordings (the ones recorded from inside the tent) on the BFRO site, and guesstimates that the creature(s) were 100 to 200 yards away from their camp site. He didn't feel threatened at all and thinks they were communicating back and forth....The witness has a theory that the bio-diesel fuel of his truck, which can smell like fried food, could have possibly attracted the animal(s)....There was one other group of campers in the park, in a large bus-like coach RV. He assumes they didn't hear anything....In an afterthought, the witness stated that he should have gone back to the spot the next day \"because there probably would have been footprints,\" but he didn\u0092t.",
