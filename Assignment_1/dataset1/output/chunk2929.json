A few months ago something screamed at me and then went who \"who\" like an owl. I looked up the scream on the web and the thing it sounded most like was a cougar, but the owl sound was not an owl. Other things that happens is rocks being thrown when I'm in garden, or at night when I get home and sit on back porch. Once when I was cutting fire wood at dusk and was loading wood something or someone threw a lot of rocks and made a ruckus. Also at night when I get home I sit on back porch to play with my dogs something hits the side of an old outhouse along with the rock throwing and screams. This happens most nights of the week. I've never seen anything but the day after the scream and owl call I went to where it sounded like it came from and found one track in an old rotten log. It looked like a person was barefoot and the track was the ball of the foot and the toes was showing but rain washed some of it away. Also this weekend I went to check out my treestands and beside one was a tree with big branches piled around it in a way that doesn't look natural to me. Like I said I live on a 200 acre farm and my closest neighbor is a mile away. and I hear stuff and things get tossed off of hillsides night and day.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked extensively with the witness on the telephone.  He is experiencing multiple incidents on his 200 acre farm that was inherited from his grandparents.  The activity seems to happen during the spring and summer months. \u0093Nothing significant has happened since the first week of September.\u0094 The witness works afternoon shift and does not get home until 10 or 10:30 pm.   Last spring, he heard a \u0093whoop\u0094 up the holler at an estimated distance of 600 yards away.  About ten minutes later, he heard the same \u0093whoop\u0094 (only much louder) from the barn area 70 yards away.   He immediately grabbed a gun and a spotlight to go outside.  Living alone, with no close neighbors, he did not see or hear anything while he was outside.  This summer he was putting in a garden and noticed that rocks about the size of your head kept rolling down the hill while he was pounding in tomato stakes.  He would stop and look up the hill, but the rocks would stop.  As soon as he looked down to start working, the rocks would come down the hill again.  This happened three times in a row while either pounding stakes or tying up the tomato plants.  He got an eerie feeling that he was being watched.  Then suddenly a tree fell over on the hill where the rocks were coming from.  He has heard trees fall at least two more times since then.Later that summer, he was splitting wood for winter.  He would get home at 10 or so and split a few logs every night before he went inside.  As he was splitting logs, he would hear pebbles from the hillside hit the tin roof of his car port.One night, he was sitting outside of his house relaxing when a \u0093blood curdling\u0094 scream came from the flat of the hill about thirty yards over his head.  \u0093It sounded like a woman screaming\u0094, the witness shared.  As soon as the scream stopped, he heard \u0093who, who\u0094.  But it did not sound like an owl, it sounded like somebody saying \u0093who\u0094.   He yelled up the hill asking \u0093who is up there?\u0094  But he did not get a reply.Lastly, the witness noted that he has been going through a fifty pound bag of dog food each week for two outside dogs he keeps.  He thinks this is an abnormally large amount of dog food for just two dogs. He is currently using his only trail camera for his deer stand, but plans to train the camera on the dog bowls over the winter.",
