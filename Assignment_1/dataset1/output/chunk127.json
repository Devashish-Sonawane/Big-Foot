            "Follow-Up Report": "Both husband and wife witnesses were independently phone interviewed approximately 3 weeks after the reported incident.  Both witnesses retold the same story and a 40 minute inquiry provided some additional details summarized below.The couple had previously hiked in this rural area of the state forest numerous times and was somewhat familiar with the secondary trails on which they were hiking.  Approximately 1 hr into the hike the husband heard a loud and distinctive, single \u0091grunt\u0092 from close range followed by very brief heavy footfall movement.  The area on both sides of the trail had thick under bush with no significant visibility.  The wife did not hear the vocalization but described the brief movement as \u0091heavy leaf crunching\u0094.   The couple remained still and relatively quiet for approximately 30 seconds, and not hearing anything further continued on the trail.  Approximately one hour later, about 1 PM, the couple was headed back on the same trail.  In the same area of the initial vocalization both simultaneously observed a highly visible set of 6 footprints (3 pairs of right-left prints) on the trail in a patch of relatively hard, dry mud.  The tracks were headed in the same direction as the witnesses were walking.  Both witnesses stated that they did not see the footprints on the trail while stopped earlier on the hike in, and were particularly surprised by both the depth and distinctive toes of the prints.  Upon further questioning, the husband stated that a set of fresh looking deer prints were co-located with the footprints, along with a short track of less distinctive but noticeable smaller footprints.  The husband commented that he believed whatever left the footprints was \u0091chasing\u0092 the deer, since both sets of tracks were co-located and headed in the same direction.  While stopped and investigating the prints and tracks, both individuals commented that the forest was unusually still and quiet.After taking cell phone photos, the couple continued on the trail but quickly became uneasy, nervous and disoriented to the point that both reported becoming temporarily lost on the trail network. Both witnesses reported not seeing any other hikers on the trail that day. The original cell phone photos are of relatively poor quality. The witness and two other adults returned to the site approximately 3 weeks later and the witness reported that several of the prints were still visible.  A cast was successfully made of a single, right-foot print.  Two photos of the footprint cast are shown below. Measurement shows print to be approximately 10\" length, 5\" width, and heel depth of 2.5\". . This incident took place in a relatively unused portion of Leominster State Forest, a 4,300-acre parcel of forested land that has remained largely undeveloped since Colonial settlements in the early 1700s. The forest is part of an expansive greenway area that includes Wachusett Mountain State Reservation containing the largest known area of Old Growth Forest east of the Connecticut River in Massachusetts.  The entire greenway is comprised of upland hardwood forests, alpine meadows, ponds, streams, and wood and shrub swamps.  The area supports a rich and diverse wildlife and bird population.  The location of these prints is approximately 4 miles northwest of an area in southern Leominister known by locals as \u0093Monsterland\u0094, a nickname that originates from purported sightings by numerous individuals of a hairy man on the same stretch of road in the 1950s and early 1960s.  This incident is also approximately 15 miles southeast of BFRO Report 8717.",
