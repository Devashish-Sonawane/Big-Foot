Were parallel to Railroad tracks on the right, woods on the left.  I was focused on the road. It appeared appx 200 ft. in front of the car.  I didn\u0092t see it come out of the woods but saw it right before it crossed the road in two bounds.  It was large, maybe 8 ft., covered in black hair or fur.  There was a difference in color in the face and hands.  They were lighter in color.  Once it crossed the road, it headed toward the railroad tracks and was gone by the time I got there.  This all happened within a span of five to six seconds.",
