My husband and I like to escape the summer heat of the valley (Phoenix) as much as possible, and our usual means of escape is up to the Mogollon Rim in Coconino County.  We have been going there for years, and we know most of it like the backs of our hands, including all the sounds and wildlife in the area.  We generally stay away from the populated lake areas and travel further into the deep woods where there are fewer people.  In fact, some weekends we may not see anyone at all, but most of the time maybe at most a couple of other campers riding ATVs or something.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking to the witness on the phone I had the opportunity to visit this location. I found it using GPS coordinates the witness provided.  Some pieces of glass from the broken mirror were still laying on the ground as she said.  The trees were quite thick around the campsite at eye level which verified that she could not see what caused the bark tearing sound or what threw the branch. I wandered just a few yards into the trees in the direction the branch was thrown from and was unable to clearly see the campsite.  In general the trees and underbrush are very thick around the whole area.The witness said the biscuits were taken from a two piece foil wrapper with the biscuits sitting on the bottom piece and the top foil was crimped around the edges to the bottom piece. The next morning they found the top foil was laid next to the bottom without being torn, biscuits gone and no crumbs left.  A bag of chips and their coolers were undisturbed.During a phone conversation after visiting the site I asked the witness about the thrown branch and what they did with it.  Unfortunately they burned it, at the time not thinking anyone would need to see it.The witnesses intend to return to camp there again.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted witness via email, then set up a phone interview. He is very credible.As stated, he and his girlfriend were settling in for the night, when they heard definite \"heavy & rhythmic\" bipedal footsteps in the woods, seemingly headed straight towards them. He reached outside the tent, grabbed and hand full of chat (gravel) and tossed it in the direction of the footsteps. Whatever it was stopped, and took \"7-8 steps\" backwards in a \"kind of running, about twice the walking gait \" they had just heard. Then after a few seconds, it started back towards them.At that point, They were totally creeped out and they decided whatever it was was large & determined and they hopped in the car and \"tore out of there\". As mentioned, they went back and forth a few times and grabbed stuff that was valuable/essential, and spent the rest of the night in a small rest area.The next morning they went back to the campsite and restarted the fire, had breakfast, and followed pretty much what he had stated above. Then they headed out for hiking the trail. The following is the description of the sighting and physical characteristics of the creature:> 7-8 ft. tall, using the trees as a reference. > Mostly oval head shape. > Walked upright, with no hunching> It was slender, though it was \"very well built\"> \"not chunky like Patty\" (Patterson/Gimlin film). > Very long arms and hair was 5-6 in all over. He only had a side view, so no facial or other features were noted at that distance. It was running and covered 30 yards very quickly before it was gone into the woods.As he stated, girlfriend did not see it. She was several steps behind him as they hiked. When he said, \"we need to leave\", there was no argument from her. He was young at the time, no cell phones, and he had \"some general knowledge\" of Sasquatch, pretty much what he had heard here and there.He couldn't say why he was scared of the steps in the woods, other than it \"walked very heavily, and it was unknown\" to him. Just a funny feeling he should leave. When they went back the next morning, he saw what he \"assumed\" was the same creature from the night before, a half mile or so from the camp where it happened.________________________________________________________________________________________[Notes from Matt Moneymaker:This area is near the eastern boundary of northeastern-most portion of Mark Twain National forest (Twain NF) -- the closest it gets to the Mississippi River on this side of MO.The boundary of Twain NF is not a boundary that Sasquatches would be aware of. It is not a starkly obvious boundary where continuous farmland suddenly becomes continuous forest. That is certainly the case elsewhere but not here. The Twain Nat For is interwoven with small grandfathered farms within its boundaries. So the landscape doesn't change dramatically when you cross out of it. There's just a higher ratio of farm to forest outside its boundaries. If you want to test this area to see if Sasquatches are still around this location, the best approach would be to scout the John J. Audubon Historic Trail during the day and then come back before sundown and walk along it without a flashlight until midnight or so. The loop trail is 12 miles so there's a lot of forest both inside the loop and outside the loop. You will hear Sasquatches before you see them, if they're still around. There's a good chance that Sasquatches are still in the vicinity because the area has not changed much since the 1970's.The 12 mile loop of John J. Audubon Trail near Womack, MO",
