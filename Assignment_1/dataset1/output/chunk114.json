            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness A.J. and found him to be a pleasant person, open and willing to talk about his experience. He described himself as being about 27 at the time of the incident. He is of American Indian descent and manages a local business. A.J.'s recollection of the event was vivid and he expressed a very deep fear of the animal he had seen, both at the time and still to this day. Since his report was of two men parked in a secluded area, I asked him if he had been drinking. As I suspected, he stated that they had just gotten a 24 pack of beer and that he and his friend had each had about two beers. However, he insisted that he was not intoxicated and knew what he had seen. He described the animal as being 8 to 9' tall and guessed that its shoulders were 4' wide. He stated that he never heard the animal itself make any noises, other than its movement, and that he never smelled anything.  A.J. insisted that his sense of smell is good.He stated that as he stood outside of the car to urinate, he heard its movement in the medium length brush, but assumed it to be a smaller, common animal. He noted that it moved, then stopped, then moved, stopped, and so on. He stated that he and the animal stood facing each other at approximately five yards for several seconds, and that when he began moving out of fear back to his friend's car, he saw the animal moving very slowly off to his right. A.J. stated that he returned to the area the next day with others to look for any evidence, but that it had snowed overnight with a pretty good coverage, and they were unable to locate anything. He and the same group returned again later that evening, built a campfire, and waited, but the animal was not seen again. He stated that he told his aunt about the incident about two days after it occurred, and she then related several stories of local men, most of them Indians, seeing the creature in the same area in the past. A.J. said that a lot of people go to the area to \"hang out\" and party, and that he had been there numerous times previous to this incident. He and friends have heard \"things\" in the dark, such as brush breaking, as if someone were trying to walk quietly through the area, and that once they had heard what sounded like a man's voice, \"yelling, or screaming\" in the darkness. On another ocassion when a group was out there, a friend was standing with his arm around his girlfriend when he felt something hit him in the back of the neck. A.J. said that when they investigated, they found that it was fish entrails, which they thought was very strange.  They yelled out into the darkness, asking whoever had thrown the items to identify themselves, thinking it was a person playing  a prank, but that they neither heard, nor saw, anything. This report was investigated by BFRO volunteer M.B., an Oklahoma City metro area police officer.",
