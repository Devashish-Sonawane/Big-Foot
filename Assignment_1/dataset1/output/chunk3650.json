            "Observed": "For several years we have visited my in-laws that live in a small town in northern Utah that borders national forest near East Canyon Reservoir. My mother in law would continually tell me about loud screaming sounds she would hear echoing through the canyons and draws above her home. I never thought too much of it until I spent a night camping near their home with my son. I heard this scream several times throughout the night. I have since heard it many times during the past few years. The scream is so incredibly loud, I can't imagine it could possibly come from a man. It's a fierce scream with a powerful low frequency growl. Loud \"hoot\" sounds can be heard echoing also. It can be quite an intimidating sound to hear at night.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness 11/29/06.The vocalizations have been heard by him and other family members going back about ten years.  He offered more clarification. Each call, he refers to as a scream, lasts up to around 15 seconds with a minute or more between for a total of 5 or 6.  Sometimes the scream would be followed by a few whoops.  He described the sound as deep, growling, masculine, angry and primate like.  The vocalizations are heard around dusk and into the night from a mile or so back in the canyon, echoing makes it hard to estimate.  He has never stuck around to hear if there are more calls, he finds the sound rather intmidating. He has listened to alleged bigfoot recordings and finds them similar but not exactly the same.  He is a hunter and is familiar with native animal sounds. ",
