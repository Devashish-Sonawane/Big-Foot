            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed both the submitter of this report and his mother on two occasions.  I found their accounts to be consistent and believable.  There were two sightings and the following can be added to the report:The first sighting was in 2011 at noon with the mom and son both witnessing the creature from their car.  This route is driven by both witnesses daily. The hair was dark brown, long, shaggy and matted. The legs and hips were extremely thick and full of muscles. The height was estimated at seven feet and weight at 350 pounds with no fat noted. It crossed the road and into the woods in about three seconds.  It moved very fast, running left to right on two legs. It used its hands and arms to shield its face as it sprinted into the thick undergrowth and branches. They were driving at 30 MPH when she hit the brakes.  The biped was about 15 feet from the bumper by the time she stopped.The second sighting was in April of 2014 at 9 pm and happened within a few feet of the first sighting. The son was alone and driving home during the second sighting. The creature was dark in color and about the same size as the one seen in 2011 with a thick back noted. The creature dropped down low and ran away into the woods on the left side of the road when the high beams hit it.The two witnesses went to the location of the two sightings the following day, found and photographed some possible formations made from small, twisted branches and broken branches on the ground. We have reviewed the photos, not enough detail is seen to determine whether or not they were made with hands or if the branches broke and the sticks fell that way naturally.In August of 2014 at 2 am, the son's friend drove up to his house and a biped could be seen walking inside a wood line behind the house.  It stepped behind a tree when the high beams were turned on.  Eye-shine was then seen peeking out to the left then right side of the tree, back and forth for about 20 minutes before the eye-shine disappeared.  The eyes were determined to be about 8 feet off the ground after inspecting the area with his friend the next day.  This happened about half a mile from the other two sightings.",

I heard funny noises, but thought it was a bear or some other animal grunting and what not. Last night (about 4:30 AM actually, so this morning) I was stopped along the road looking over my route sheet, when out of the corner of my eye I saw someone walking. I slowly reached up and turned off the light. I put the car in gear, and looked over. What I saw made the hair stand on the back of my neck, and got tears in my eyes. It wasn't 7 feet tall, more like 6 feet or so -  I'm guessing, because it didn't seem to be bending over too far to look at me. It was maybe 5 or 6 feet away from my car. I was so frightened that I drove off as fast as I could. I called 911 and they thought I was a nut, and said it was most likely a vagrant, or homeless guy. I don't think so.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone and the following comments are the results of that conversation.The witness was working at the time of the sighting and was taking a break from his duty when something approached the vehicle from the passenger side.  The windshield was covered with a light film of dust from the road, causing a reflection of his car stereo faceplate, which is blue in color with a dolphin screen saver.  This is what the witness thought the sasquatch was interested in, as the screen saver was moving on his radio.At the beginning of the sighting the dome light was on.  The witness shut it off to see what the movement was outside of the vehicle. The witness stated that when the sasquatch approached, it was in a crouched position walking toward the vehicle, never taking its focus off the inside of vehicle. The witness also said that there was a small yellow strobe light on top of the vehicle that was blinking off and on because of his job.The sighting lasted less than a minute and the witness gave a very good description of the sasquatch that approached within ten feet of his vehicle. One thing that was noticed about the sasquatch was the reflection of the eyes that were large in size.The estimated height of the sasquatch was around six and one half feet.  The height was estimated from the height of the Jeep the witness was driving. The witness watched as the sasquatch became aware of somebody inside the vehicle and crossed the road.An emergency call was made and the dispatcher mentioned to the witness that this was not the first call to come across the board about a bigfoot sighting in the area.\"I never... NEVER believed in BIGFOOT before that morning.  I was the biggest skeptic out there. I have a degree in science, and I still can't believe it.  To be honest with you, I don't want to go back out there, but it's my job and will just not let it bother me.  I don't think I will stop by the same area every morning.\"",
