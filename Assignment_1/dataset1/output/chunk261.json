The animals were found near the bigfoot sighting location in an opening within a persimmon patch. However, upon examination, the witness, a hunter himself, determined that the deer had not been shot. He moved the deer to check for bullet holes and, in so doing, discovered that the necks had been broken. He and the others looked for tracks, but found none in the surrounding grassy area. The witness is a Vietnam veteran and a state employee. He did not wish for additional information to be shown because he is widely known in the region. In fact, it turned out that we have several acquaintances in common. I'm convinced that this is a highly credible person and believe it likely that the deer kill stash was connected to the sasquatch seen the previous evening.",
