            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness added the following information:The night sky was very clear and the moon was full or near full.  In addition, there had been a recent ice storm which made the ground very reflective, making the surroundings readily visible without a light source.  As a result, the animal was easy to see despite its initial distance from the witness.  The animal's speed was described as rapid, although it did not look like it was running, but more of a cross-country skiing-like motion.  It cleared the fence (barbed wire) without breaking stride.It's motions were animal like, not human-like.  The witness noted the arms were swinging.  He estimated that the closet the animal got was 20-30 yards, and at that distance he could clearly see that the animal \"towered\" over the bridge parapets.  The bridge parapets were approximately 4 ft. to 4-1/2 ft. in height; subsequently, the animal was estimated at 10-12 ft. in height.  At this distance he could also see that the eyes were \"blood red\", similar to lawn reflectors, but he wasn't sure if that was the actual eye color or the reflection off of his car's lights.It should be noted that while the animal's height is certainly at the higher end of the reported height estimates, there are other reports in which the witness(s) claim that the subject animals reached these heights.  It is possible that the witness' postion to the animal created an angle of view which resulted in a over-estimation of it's height, or that in his heightened state of emotion he simply thought it was bigger than it really was.  However, the witness did had an excellent basis for height comparison and estimation (based on the bridge parapets) and so it is possible that the animal was 10 ft.+ in height. This region in New York has a long history of sightings, with at least one story dating back to Colonial times.  Sightings in this region have been the subject of at least one book.",

There was a huge lake there also, it was called Jackson's Lake. Mr. Jackson was a cattle farmer. His cattle were on the other side of the lake. There were many trails in those woods and me and my friend Daniel played in them many, many times. It was very easy to loose yourself out there all day.",
