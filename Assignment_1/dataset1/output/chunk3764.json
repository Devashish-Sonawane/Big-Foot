My sister and I were on our way home late at night (approx. 2:00 a.m.) when a bigfoot walked in front of my sister's Honda touching the front of the vehicle. It was very hairy and had long arms. It walked upright, but this creature had a sideways gait as though limping or injured. It looked straight at us and walked slowly. It did not appear to be afraid. It was approximately 5 foot four I'd say. It closely resembled an orangutan.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke on the phone with the primary witness and then later to her sister.  Although in the report the witness stated that it looked like an orangutan, when I directed her to a website with pictures of orangs she stated that it didn't really look like that.  Her sister stated that she was in such a state of shock when it occurred that she really didn't get a good look at the face.  Her estimate of its height was 4 1/2 to 5 feet tall.  The witness said the hair was orangish-brown, while her sister called it orangish-red.(This area is very near the central Indiana Hoosier National Forest.)",
