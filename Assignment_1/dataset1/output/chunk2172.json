However, I was impressed by his story.The witness was driving his regular route, headed southbound on Hwy 115.  It was pre-dawn and overcast, so the night was dark.  The sighting occurred on the left (east) side of road lasting the short time the animal was lit by his headlights.   While approaching the animal \"it was kind of bent over, and as I got closer it kind of stood up.\"  He then noted that it was not a deer or bear as he had begun to assume.  It had \"eyes in front not like a bear\" and \"was big with shoulders.\"  He couldn\u2019t tell the color of its fur.He would\u2019ve looked for tracks later but it snowed that day.  He didn\u2019t expect to find any.The witness, like other Colorado Springs locals, knows the hill as \u201cRed Hill\u201d though it is not designated as such on the USGS quadrangle.  Red Hill is approximately 6 miles south of the Fort Carson main gate.  Hwy 115 follows the western boundary of Ft. Carson Military Reservation.  This is also about 5 miles from NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) located inside Cheyenne Mountain.",
