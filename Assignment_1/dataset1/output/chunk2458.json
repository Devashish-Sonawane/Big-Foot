The animal was about 50 yards away when he observed it, illuminated by one of the neighbor's flood lights as it ran by.  It wasn't a silhouette the entire time.  Its fur color is described as silver gray.Both PB and RB had not seen or heard anything prior to this incident, at or near this location.The area is loaded with deer.  PB said large numbers of deer are seen almost every night.  At this time of year does (female deer) are giving birth to fawns.  Most deer kills found in the central and eastern states are young deer.PB mentioned a cluster of incidents a few years back in a nearby community.  There were apparently several sightings and encounters around the town of Ironto, VA.  This was happening around the time hurricane Hugo blew through VA.  During the 2-3 days of the hurricane lots of trees were blown down, and the bigfoots were moving around a lot more at night.  Some were seen running around  \"frantically,\" coming close to homes, etc., during the storm. Ironto, VA is in the \"V\" of the fork of the Roanoke River where the North Fork and the South Fork of the Roanoke converge.  The incident occuring a few days ago (4/4/02) is about two miles from the Roanoke River, and downstream about nine miles from Ironto.",
