            "Observed": "When I was young,six years old, Ronnie Joe a friend of mine and myself was playing behind Ronnie's house.  We heard a thumbing sound and moved closer to see what was making the sound.  Just behind a neighbor's house we saw a big foot digging in the ground with a stick of fire wood, at times taking one stick of fire wood and pounding a second stick into the ground. Then he would turn the dirt over, using the stick like a spade. He may have been looking for food, but we never knew for sure.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and his friend walked around to the rear of the friend's house to investigate the source of a thumping noise.  Upon rounding the corner of the house, they stopped and stared at a bigfoot squatting down near the foundation of a neighbor's house, about thirty feet away.  They saw it from the side for five to ten seconds as it was using two eighteen inch long pieces of firewood to dig with.  After a couple of blows it raised up, turned, and started walking towards them, displaying its teeth at them in a kind of snarl, but without making any sound.  The boys, stricken with fear, ran back around and into the friend's house where, after much effort, they got the friend's mother to take a look.  When she did, however, the bigfoot was gone, and the only evidence left was the disturbed ground where it had been digging.  The animal must have moved with great speed to either a nearby creek, or a nearby cornfield.The bigfoot was approximately six and a half to seven feet tall and appeared to weigh over 300 pounds.  It had very dark brown, coarse, stringy hair, similar to a goat's.  The hair on the chest, stomach area and lower abdomen was a dull gray color.  The face was black, and the nose looked like a flattened human nose.  The fingernails and toenails were very thick - possibly from 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick - and dirty.  They looked as though they would be very useful for digging.  It had two canine teeth that were a little larger than a human's.  It had no sagittal crest, no noticeable breasts or sex organs, and no odor.This sighting is notable in that it's an observation of a bigfoot using a tool - two pieces of wood used as a hammer and chisel.  The use of tools is considered by scientists to be an indicator of the level of intelligence of an animal, especially a primate.  There has been much speculation on the intelligence of bigfoot, and on whether they use tools or not.  This sighting indicates that they are indeed capable of using crude tools.",

            "Observed": "Our family kept a bee yard near Mt. Shasta, on the old Oregon Trail.  One evening, after tending the bees, my father looked up towards the road home and saw a man standing near a stump of a tree.  Then he heard a sort of yip-yip-yipee sound, somewhere between a coyote and a cowboy roundup yell, but very loud.  Our old dog Queeny jumped into the car like she was scared.  The man-like creature took off, loping away in a slow run with it's arms sort of hanging down.  When my dad drove closer to the stump later on, he realized that by the height of the stump and the height of the man or man-like creature, that it would have had to be much larger and taller than any normal man.  We believe it was \"bigfoot.\"",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness had the following information to add to the report:\"This happened when I was a little girl, so I don't have a very clear recollection.  When the family was loading up to go home from the beeyard, we heard that strange yelp, and the dog was freaked out.  All the coyotes in the area shut up. He saw a manlike creature near a tall stump. He really thought it was a man and wondered what a man would be doing out in that desolate place, but when he approached with the car, perhaps to give the fellow a ride, that's when the guy ran off, and then looking at the stump where he was, realized the guy would have had to be 9 feet tall.  It was getting near dark, so I don't think he really saw any particular markings, only that it was like a man.  The most distinctive things were the yelping noise, and then the way it ran away.  We weren't even sure that the noise came from it, but we heard the noise twice, once when we were loading up and again after the creature turned away.  Dad said the long gait was not like a man, because it was longer steps, like a very long legged man, but so sure footed, as if accustomed to running through that rocky area.\"",
