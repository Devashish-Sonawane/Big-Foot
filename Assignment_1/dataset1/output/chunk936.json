            "Observed": "I was assigned to Ft Rucker, AL from Oct 1991 until Jan 1997 as a fire fighter. As military firefighters we would often be assigned to small airfields (stagefields) around Ft Rucker. At the time this happened I was assigned to Tabernacle stagefield. Tabernacle was on the north west end of a large impact area used for aerial gunnery by pilots in training. During a typical duty day we would have several down time periods where aircraft were not flying. These down time periods would typically take place around noon and evening lasting 2.5 to 3 hours.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a 37 year old male. He is a military unit administrator for the Army Reserves. As he was repeating the details of his encounter, he stated that he was getting goosebumps and recalling his fear. He states that he is positive that it was not a case of misidentification. That he was in shock at what he had seen and was trying to convince himself, that it had to be something else. The witness also stated that he only saw the creature's right side and back as it turned to leave. The creature did not run, but moved very quickly, with the thick brush offering no resistance.In the written report he stated that he saw a large \" shadow\". During our phone conversation he stated that he did actually see the creature, albeit briefly. What he meant when he said \"shadow\" was that it was very dark colored, but he was not able to see any of it's features. It therefore appeared to him as a \"shadowy\" figure.More info about Fort Rucker Army Base",

The creature stood only about 80 feet away and was illuminated by a hand held spotlight.He described the face as between dark gray and black, with the body covered in rust colored hair. The hair was long and unkempt but not matted. When first sighted, the creature was standing by a four-strand, barbed wire fence. He reported the height was about 3\u00bd feet taller than the fence. The creature shielded its eyes, attempting to see what the witness was doing. It turned and walked 3 \u0096 4 steps and repeated the attempt to watch the witness. It looked back at the witness periodically, during its slow walk back to the treeline, which he estimates took about 10 minutes. The witness was impressed by how casual the creature seemed.  He said his ex-wife doesn't want to discuss the incident.",
