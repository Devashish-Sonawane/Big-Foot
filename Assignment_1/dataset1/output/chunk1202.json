On your left you will see a trail (actually more than one but they all seem to come together).  Looking south toward Hidden Lake you will see the shelters.

The two were walking into the woods off a trail near our home and saw a huge beige gorilla like creature.  The minute they saw it they were so scared they ran home.  Our daughter said there was no way this was a costumed person or another animal.  It was a tall two legged creature covered with beige colored hair. The two girls reported this incident to me almost immediately after it happened.  There was snow on the ground and they were wearing boots.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The place where this sighting occurred is just north of Minneapolis/St. Paul in a loosely populated suburban area. A chain of large marshy lakes with substantial surrounding low lands and some wooded areas extend into the area from the north. I was shown the place where the sighting occurred by \u0093G,\u0094 one of the witnesses (now 25), and her mother, the person who submitted the report. I also interviewed the second witness by phone. Both women described essentially the same thing to me. Fifty to one hundred yards away they saw an upright, blonde colored \u0093gorilla.\u0094  It was seen within the wild area only a quarter of a mile or so from the house lined street where the girls lived.The creature was standing on a rise and was entirely visible to the two girls. At first it seemed to be bending over, but then it straightened up and seemed to notice the girls. At that point they ran home. The sighting was brief but both women impressed me as completely honest and sincere in their belief that they saw what they described to me: a big \"gorilla\" entirely covered with \u0093blonde\u0094 hair. The second woman, \u0093K,\u0094 said the animal was dirty, especially the legs. G told me, at the time, they called it a gorilla because they\u0092d never heard of a bigfoot.The \"shelters\" mentioned by the G's mother appeared to me to have been made by kids.G and K saw something extraordinary when they were girls that has steadfastly stuck with them as real. If it was a sasquatch it is noteworthy for having been so near the Twin Cities. The chain of wild lakes and surrounding marsh land would have provided a corridor from the country to the north into the developing suburb where the creature was seen. It is also interesting that the animal\u0092s color was described by both witnesses as blonde. A 2001 sighting near Bemidji, Minnesota involved an animal described by the witnesses as tan or cardboard colored, and a 1972 sighting near Willow River, Minnesota was of two white creatures.",
