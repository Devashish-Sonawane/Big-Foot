            "Follow-Up Report": "I met this gentleman, whom I'll call \"Jack,\" at his home on January 25th, 2014 to interview him and visit the location he identified.  Although this event occurred over 27 years ago, the major details appeared to be easy to recall, while he was very candid about those things he could not recall with certainty.In 1986 Jack was 16 years of age and working the closing shift at a local McDonald's.  This would put him off work a little past 1:00AM and his Mother would pick him up for the drive home.  On this particular night (the exact date is not recalled) his Mother was driving them home on the usual route, north on Iverson Rd/171st Avenue and as they approached the intersection with McCallister Road, they spotted a figure standing on the left or west side of the road.  The figure was visible first by moonlight and then by the headlights of their car, which was traveling at an estimated 30mph.  Jack described the figure as \"enormous, fully covered in dark brown hair with a reddish tinge\".  He said that as they passed the figure he was looking out the driver's side window and felt that he made eye contact with it.  As he turned  in his seat to visually track the figure, he was watching through the rear window as it crossed the road behind their car, and saw it glance once in their direction.Jack and I drove to the location.  There is still a street sign where the figure was seen, although it is unknown if this is the original sign.  The road runs very straight for over 6,000 feet distance approaching and passing this location, on a slight uphill grade.  Behind where the figure was standing is a deep and wooded ravine that runs south approximately 1/4 mile to the power line crossing the right-of-way.Our efforts to recreate the sighting indicated that the figure was observable for at least 6 seconds, that it was approximately 9' in height and had a shoulder width of 4' or more.There has been some development in this area but many of the homes have large lots or acreage and there is an abundance of natural greenbelts throughout this part of Snohomish County.  Deer, coyotes, raccoon, and bobcat are frequently seen here.  In my opinion, there is enough natural cover to conceal any creature or person who prefers to travel unseen.  Also, this location is only 6 or 7 miles (as the crow flies) from other sightings and the location of the \"Snohomish County Howl.\"",
