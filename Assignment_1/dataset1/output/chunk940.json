            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness the following should be noted: - The witness and his wife observed two sets of tracks in the snow. The track way extended over 200 yards. A typical track was approximately 15-16 inches in length and had a human shape. The tracks looked old, possibly because of snow melt. The typical step (between foot prints, left to right) was approximately 52 inches. The two trackways separated for a time then came back together. The tracks were seen in the March 2003, not 2004 as noted in the submitted report (this was a simple mistake as the report was submitted in July 2004).-The wood knocks were heard at 11:00 p.m. There were 3-4 successive knocks, a pause, and then 3-4 more knocks. The pattern was repeated several times.- There has been no recently observed activity.- In subsequent correspondence with the witness, we discussed further the possibility that a leaping deer had made them.  The witness provided the following explanation:\u0093I was just up in our woods last week after a fresh snow, and I know the type of track that you are describing, they are everywhere and can go for quite a distance. You can usually see the hoof prints in these tracks when they are fresh, but what differentiates these tracks from the tracks that I saw were: 1) the tracks that I saw where more defined in the shape of a large human type track, more flat at the bottom; 2) they alternated between right and left more than deer tracks, which are pretty much in a straight line when they are leaping. The tracks that I saw where alternating more like a human\u0092s walk.  The distance between the deer leap tracks is very similar to the distance between the tracks that we saw. That is the only similarity.\u0094",

            "Observed": "My friend and I were sitting on my porch smoking a cigarette and talking about the recent drama going on in our lives. Straight in front of us about 60 yards was an iron ore hill, the top of it was clearly visible with a straight flat top as most of them are. On the top of the hill in the middle of our view was a single tree. As we were talking and smoking a person comes walking on the top of the hill. I started to make fun of the way this person was walking. The Arms were long and swaded back and forth with each stride. The legs were also long and odd looking as it walked. It walked in a frumpy way. the upper back was hunched slightly. It passed the tree and thats when I said, \"look how tall that person is.\" It was about 4 feet taller than the tree. In the time that it took to walk in and out of our view point was about 40 seconds. After it was out of sight was then when we realized that no person could walk that distance in that short of time, and no person would be that tall looking that far away. I seriously feel that we saw bigfoot that day.",

She did tell me where the trailer she was living in at the time was and where she seen the \"thing\" walking. I went there and visited the trailer and the top of the mine hill. There are many mine hills in the area as the result of all of the mining over the years. The area is dotted with lakes, swamps, and thick forests made up of varied trees. I feel it is very possible and even likely that she and her friend seen a sasquatch walk along the edge of the mine pit as there have been a number of sightings in that area and around that same time. And the fact that they could see it so well from below would suggest that it was of a larger than normal size. The tops of the mine hills are very remote and supposed to be off limits to the public for safety reasons. It would be a great travel route for sasquatch to stay away from people. The trees on the top of the hill range from 8 - 12 feet now. So taken that this happened a couple of years ago it still would be a large animal to be taller than any of the trees.",
