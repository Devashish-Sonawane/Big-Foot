            "Follow-Up Report": "Robert Fletcher (biologist and investigation volunteer) and I visited the site of the encounter and spoke at length with the witness and others who were involved in the incident. The site is at the edge of the Big Thicket National Preserve. The vegetation is dense, and in many areas nearly impenetrable. During the face-to-face interview, the primary witness gave a compelling report of how she viewed a large, hairy ape-like creature as it was peering through the bedroom window. The witness showed us where the animal was positioned and described exactly how it was apparently standing when she saw it. The witness described the animal as standing to the side of the window in what must have been a bent stance; its left shoulder was visible and it had the appearance of being somewhat stooped. The witness saw hair on the shoulder and all over the head. One small human-like ear was visible on the animal's left side; the ear was partly covered with hair. The witness stated that the nose was wide and flat. Hair covered the face except around the mouth and eyes. The skin was black. The eyes were said to be very large and dark - and the witness remarked that the eyes scared her; she saw no white around the eyes. The closest thing that the witness could compare the animal to was a gorilla. Upon comparing my own height of five feet eleven inches in a stooped position while viewing from the side of the window in the same manner as the animal as described by the witness, it became apparent that the animal must have been one foot taller than me; Fletcher and I surmised that the creature was no less than roughly seven feet in height.The witness stated that the animal appeared to quickly recede into the darkness toward the thicket surrounding the house. When the submitter of the report arrived, he and his partner attempted to venture into the thicket to determine the source of the sounds of footfalls they were hearing. As they approached, the footfalls retreated deeper into the thicket. He and his partner would stop, the footfalls would stop; they attempted again to proceed after the unseen trespasser and once again it proceeded to flee deeper into the dense undergrowth. The men did find a single track in the sand and found a section of the fence behind the house bent over. The witnesses have since burned a significant amount of the thicket surrounding the house in an attempt to make the immediately adjacent areas more conducive to visibility. The redounding ashes seemed to make the area quite good for footprints, should the witnesses be revisited.The Alabama-Coushatta word for the animal is \"eeyachuba.\" ",
