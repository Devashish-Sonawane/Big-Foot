It was looking down at the dirt road. Then it turned around and looked at us. It looked to be about 7 feet tall and weighed about 500 pounds. It had long, sparse red hair; the hair was thicker on it's back and shoulder blades. No hair was on it's face. It walked towards us.. I turned around and had the girls start riding their bikes back the way we came. I followed on foot and we never looked back.",
