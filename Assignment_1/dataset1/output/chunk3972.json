            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke to the witness on 12/30/04 whom will be referred to as V. She was playing outside and looked up to notice an animal walking along a dirt road near their farm. She described it as tall, walking slightly stooped over with dark, shiny, wavy hair. The animal appeared to be searching for something in a ditch. She screamed for her mother and sister who came running to see it. Her brother came the next day and they found large footprints which she described as twice as large as a man's.V was approximately 11 years old when this happened and advised me that it would be helpful to speak to her older sister who was about 14 years old at the time and may recall more as she also saw it. I contacted V's sister immediately after I finished speaking to V. J. repeated the story as her sister did and had this to add:The actual year would have been 1961-1962 some time between fall and spring. She remembers as their father had recently passed away in the fall of 1961 and the sighting occurred shortly after his passing.J. was sitting on the front porch when she heard her sister screaming and looked up to see an animal walking along the road. The girls' mother walked out and saw it as well. J. said she felt more curious than frightened. She grabbed a rifle that they had for protection and jumped into the car with her mother. They drove towards the animal and J. said she saw that it had reddish-brown, shiny, wavy hair and estimates the animal to have been approximately  8 feet tall. J. stated they were about 1/8 mile away from it when it appeared to notice them and ran beneath a bridge at which time they lost sight of it. Woods were behind the bridge, into which she believes the animal ran. J. described it as it was walking and running as slightly bent over with \"big, long strides.\"J. went on to add that they heard first hand of other sightings by people in the area over a three month time period. At one point, the sheriff went looking for it on horseback accompanied by two men that worked for the Memphis Press Scimitar. They never found anything, however.",

            "Observed": "My name is Don. I lived with my brother in a small A-frame cabin on Corydon-Ridge road in Corydon In.47112. It was summer of 91 ,it started with hearing sounds\"howl-screams\" in the woods behind the house. It scared the heck out of us and our dogs but we blew it off until it happened again. Being young and very stupid at the time (I was 20) I got the brilliant idea of shooting into the woods from where the sounds came from. From that night till we moved out about 2 weeks later we would hear the screams getting closer We kept shooting up in the air and out into the woods about 200 yards away the screams would stop after 5-10 shots but they would start a night or 2 later. My friend James came over and camped back in the woods. He was only there for several hours he said he saw something humanoid/hairy/tall walk between 2 trees He left shortly there after. The next night my brother woke up to a large shape staring at him in the window it had to be at least 8 foot tall. The next night my friend Mike stayed over out of disbelief. That's when it howled it sounded like it was in the house it was so loud. It was right under my window(my bedroom was upstairs).We went out the next day no tracks but the back steps(WOOD 2x8's)two of them had been caved in from something heavy enough to break the door jam. The knob was not hurt the door lock was still locked it was pushed with so much force it splintered the frame where the bolt met the wood. My dogs were cowering upstairs they messed all over the upstairs they wouldn't even come to me. The house was not touched inside. It smelled like feces/skunky/wet hair/urine/ it is hard to describe it wasn't overpowering it just was strong .I moved out the next day. No one would believe me, so I've only told a few people. I asked the local people about it they all said I was nuts or they would slam the door in my face. Some people bought the place a few years later; it was rental when I was there, I thought it was odd they disassembled the tiny cabin and hauled off on a flat bed truck ,they sold the land. There is a large brick home there today. Corydon is in Indiana,Harrison county,USA 47112",
