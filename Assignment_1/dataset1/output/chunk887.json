My husband and I were driving up Hecker Pass from Watsonville, on our way to Mt Madonna to meet relatives for what I want to say was a dinner or dinner event. it seems so long ago. It happened very fast, but what I saw looked covered in brown hair from head to toe and was huge, walking just like a man. It scared me to death! My husband wasn't paying attention but he knew I saw something that frightened me terribly because I reacted emotionally so quickly. We were coming around a turn. I remember it being a very windy road, and it was walking with it's back to me. It was a very foresty area with lots of redwoods everywhere.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a close family friend. This past 4th of July, the witness and I were at the same party and she enthusiastically shared her experience with me after overhearing me talk about the subject with her cousin. She is as candid and frank as they come.The sighting location is off one of the many windy turns on Highway 152, which is directly southwest of Mt Madonna (her destination) and turns into Hecker Pass, which follows through to Gilroy. This is considered the southernmost portion of the Santa Cruz Mountains and the terrain, although varied with mixed redwood, madrone, live oak and chaparral up by Mt Madonna, is primarily covered in redwoods where the witness sighted the subject. She was able to clearly discern an extremely large, brown, hair-covered biped striding along the driver's side of the road with it's back to her, walking uphill. What she emphasized most was the tremendous size of the subject. Her husband, who was seated on the passenger side of the vehicle, likely began dozing off and didn't have an opportunity to see the subject. He clearly recalls her fearful reaction and her repetitious words \"Oh my god, Oh my god.\" They continued on to their destination of Mt Madonna. Three months prior (mid-June, 1980) to this incident, two young men had a sighting of a large sasquatch in what was then a dispersed residential area of Scott's Valley, CA roughly 30 miles northwest from this location. The incident was publicized in the Watsonville Pajaronian newspaper, but not in Carmel, where the witness of this encounter had resided.",
