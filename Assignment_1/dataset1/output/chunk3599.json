            "Observed": "This happened about 13 years ago, but I remember it like yesterday. I used to knock on my younger brother's window at night to scare him, it had been a long running joke between us. I climbed out the window in the bedroom I was staying in and brought my mom's small dog with me. When I got to my brother's window to knock I got about three inches away from knocking when I heard a load growl/roar. It was really dark so I couldn't really see very well. The figure that growled at me was way taller than me, had to be at least 6-8 feet tall. The growl was so load that it vibrated through my body. I was so scared that I couldn't move at first. When I was finally able to move I ran as fast as I could and dove back into the window I came out of. I was so scared that I ran to tell my brother about it and slept on his bedroom floor that night and never knocked on his window again!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness twice and have the following information to add.  The witness was a 17 year old girl with a 15 year old brother.  Their house was a modular home located in rural Indiana on a 14 acre property further surrounded by woods.  The brother had been complaining over the four years they lived there that something was knocking on his bedroom window and he was scared.  The little boy thought he had ghosts.  In response to his complaints, the older sister would sometimes knock on his window as a joke. During the interview the witness said that she would not always be the culprit of the knocks over the preceding four year period.   One night around midnight, she jumped out of her first story window and ran around to the back of the modular home to knock on his window and give her little brother a scare.   Due to the uneven nature of their lot, the brother\u0092s window was higher off the ground than his sister\u0092s window. The five foot three girl reached up to give her brother a knock and scare him.  As her fist was about an inch away, she experienced a roar.  The roar was like a growl that was really deep, long, and vibrated through her body.  It came from above her and had to be standing two to three feet away from her.  The teenager did not see it.  She was too afraid to look up.  She froze for what seemed like an eternity but was probably only seconds.  She took off running, never turning around to look and went straight back into her room. As it was during summer vacation, she and her brother usually stayed up late.  Her brother was up and his bedroom lights were on.  She presumes that he was playing on his guitar, which is what he constantly did. He never heard the encounter until she came into his bedroom asking to sleep in there with him that night.  The brother\u0092s room was on the forest side of the house.  The witness also spoke of a retired neighbor that would tell anyone who would listen that there were Bigfoot in the woods in their area.  Nobody paid too much attention to him.  This man has since passed away.",
