            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to JR over the phone and he had these details to add--JR was driving at night on a secluded area of Green Mountain Road west of Keyser, WV, when his headlights hit a large pair of yellowish-amber \u0091nocturnal\u0092 eyes on the left side of the road that were reflective. Slowing down, JR says that he saw that the eyes belonged to a large, hairy creature that was sitting on a log, next to the highway, approximately 50\u0092-100\u0092 away from his vehicle. JR thinks that he might have startled the creature at that point because it stood and with one, ten foot leap, landed past the middle of the highway divider line, and ran into the woods on the right side of the road. JR then turned the car towards the spot where the creature entered the woods and turned the car off and partially rolled the window down. He could hear heavy, long stride, bipedal footsteps going into the woods as well as the distinct sounds of crashing and breaking limbs. Then, realizing what he had just seen and feeling very shaken, JR started the car and headed home.-The descriptions of the details of the creature JR saw for approximately 3-5 seconds was that--It exceeded seven foot in height.-It was approximately 400-600lbs, perhaps heavier.-Its movements were quick, exact and sharp for a creature with that amount of bulk.-He had the distinct impression that it was male.-Its hair completely covered the whole creature, except around it\u0092s face. It was brownish with some white interspersed throughout its coat and it appeared matted, or \u0091dreadlocked\u0092. JR likened it to a \u0091Ghillie suit\u0092 appearance. -The arms hung very low and when running, swung them forward and back.-It had no neck.-Its face was large. JR could tell that the face had no hair on it, but could not discern any facial details like the nose, chin or brow ridge.-The girth of its chest was enormous. JR estimates that the length between its breastbone and its backbone was approximately 24 inches.-The shape of its head was \u0091taller and longer\u0092 than a human\u0092s, \u0091sort of like it was wearing a helmet\u0092.-On the way home, JR noticed the flickering lights of a campfire, near where he had seen the creature, with several people sitting around it, partying. Later, after studying the layout of the land and the local terrain, JR feels certain that the exact spot he had encountered the creature would also be the \u0091perfect\u0092 spot for someone, or something, to watch the people around the fire without their knowledge. And if he hadn\u0092t of driven up to the creature at that moment in time, it might have continued watching the oblivious partygoers. -From JR\u0092s description of the Green Mountain area, there is a heavily abundant supply of deer and other game as well as dependable sources of fresh, clean water throughout the area. It is sparsely populated and has miles upon miles of undisturbed terrain in which to hide. JR has hunted the area frequently and is very familiar with the animals that roam there. -I found JR to be honest, forthright and sincere in his rendition of the encounter, and from his description, I am convinced that he had seen a Bigfoot.

            "Observed": "I was born, raised, and currently live near Nashville, TN.  When I was about 13 years old, I had a 4-wheeler. My dad used to take me to a piece of property owned by one of his customers which is located in western Davidson County, about 10 miles directly west of downtown Nashville, on Hwy 70. It\u0092s about 1 mile east of where Hwy 70 intersects Hwy 70 South. There I could ride my ATV and shoot guns. One afternoon, a couple hours before dark, in early October of 1988, I was riding my ATV on an old logging road, which ran along a creek, in the bottom of a holler (valley between two ridges). My 9 year-old stepbrother was on the back of the ATV, hanging on for dear life as I sped down the logging road at over 40 mph. He tucked his head between my shoulder blades as he sat behind me because he was apparently scared of my driving. The power company had bush-hogged or cut the brush in a 150 foot-wide path, centered on the power line, as per routine maintenance. The power line right-of-way had grown up really thick since the last cutting, which must\u0092ve been 2 years prior to this. Just before the old logging road passed under the power line, there was a \u0093dog-leg\u0094 in the road (the road went straight, made a quick 20 degree turn to the right, and immediately turned another 20 degrees back to the left, now running in the same direction as it was originally, just 3-4 feet to the right of the original vector). I had fun seeing how fast I could drive through the \u0093dog-leg\u0094 and also scaring my younger stepbrother. On this particular day, I got up to speed, fishtailed through the \u0093dog-leg,\u0094 and proceeded to drive past the thick overgrowth, approximately 8-10 feet high, which ran under the power line. At this point, I saw something that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up! From the brush on the left side of the road, something ran out in front of me. It was covered in 5-8 inch long dark brown hair, about 7.5-8.5 feet tall, and was running on two legs! It passed right in front of me with lightening speed. I\u0092d say it only took about 2 steps to clear the 12-foot wide logging road. It then disappeared into the overgrowth on the right side of the logging road. I didn\u0092t get a really clear look at the creature because it happened so fast. I didn\u0092t stop either. Out of fear, I applied full throttle to the ATV in an attempt to vacate the area. My stepbrother didn\u0092t see a thing because he was hiding in fear of my reckless driving. I yelled out to him to see if he\u0092d seen the creature but he thought I was joking. The best description I can give of the way I felt after the incident would be to compare it to having a near miss in a fatal automobile crash! My heart just felt like it stopped before it began to beat out of my chest. Nearly an hour passed before I found the courage to return to the location of the sighting. I had to go back through the location because it was the only way back to my dad\u0092s truck. The first time I drove back through, I was travelling at a high rate of speed due to fear. Curiosity eventually got the best of me and I returned, still on my ATV, just as it was getting dark. I found no tracks (it was extremely dry at the time), smelled nothing out of the ordinary, and saw only a path through the brush, which appeared to be seldom used. I didn\u0092t say a word to my dad about what I\u0092d seen when he asked why I\u0092d been gone for so long. If I had, he would\u0092ve thought I was out of my mind. I didn\u0092t tell anyone for a long time. To this day, the event plays over in my mind like a movie.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length and found him to be extremely credible.  He does not wish to have his occupation revealed as he is a public official.  Even though he was only 12 or 13 at the time of this encounter it made a profound impact upon him and it was evident when speaking with him that he is still impacted by it to this day.The area where the encounter occurred was very rural at that time and there are two interesting points that we see over and over with these encounters - 1) the encounter happened on a power line right-of-way, and 2) there was a stream traversing the same area.Because the witness did such a thorough job with his report there are not really any additional details to add.  I am submitting this report as a Class B only because the encounter was so brief that very few details other than size, bi-pedalism, and being hair covered were observed, although I have no doubt that it was a Sasquatch that dashed across in front of the witness and his brother.",
