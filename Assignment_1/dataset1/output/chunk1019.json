The entrance road to the camping area was a few miles north of the southern entrance, the Welcome Center, of the park. The campsite was surrounded by high brush nearly all the way around three sides, the back side faced the woods. There was a small bathroom at the entrance to the camping area, which was about 100 yards or so from our campsite. This site was the last site before the woods began. There was a trail that dropped out almost right into this site. There was a small lake on the south side of the campground.",

            "Observed": "In the summer of 1994, my husband, daughter and I went camping in Ocala National Forest. I love to be out in nature, but frankly, I'm a little freaked out at night. But, nonetheless, I tough it out. Despite my nighttime reservations, I told my husband I wanted a primitive campsite, away from any other campers. We found a gorgeous spot in a primitive camping area that was surrounded by high brush nearly all the way around three sides; the back side faced the woods. We chose this particular site in case other campers moved in. This spot was secluded and private from the adjacent campsites. I have always been an extremely light sleeper, especially when it's night and there are flexible walls between me and the outdoors. I would love to sleep under the stars, but I'm much too chicken.",
