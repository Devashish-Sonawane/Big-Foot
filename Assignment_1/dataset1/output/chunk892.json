            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken with the witness numerous times both in person and by telephone. He grew up in the mountains of Western North Carolina and has lived there his entire life.  He has spent countless hours hiking, researching and hunting in this area, and knows the wildlife and geography very well. His report and recollection are very detailed and I will add some observations from our interview. The witness frequently goes out at night driving in this research area in hopes of sighting a sasquatch and to observe other local wildlife. He has used these trips to monitor wildlife movement and observe animal concentration for future research and hunting areas. The research area is approximately 38 miles from his home. The road he had his sighting on is very heavily traveled and has major curves and hills and runs through the Nantahala National Forest.Shortly before seeing the creature he spotted a coyote in the road and that heightened his senses. He was rounding a curve at traveling at approximately 30-35 mph, at 11:50 pm. when his left headlight illuminated the animal. It was standing behind the guardrail and he could not believe what he was seeing. It took a few seconds for his brain to process the shock of seeing a sasquatch, which caused him to drive past the creature a short distance. The observation lasted only a few seconds but was able to remember many details of his sighting.He could not estimate the height as it was standing on a very steep slope off the side of road. He was very amazed by the extreme width of its shoulders, comparing it to a football player in shoulder pads. It was standing in a vertical bipedal manner, he could see the spinal crease through its hair. The waist was very thin, like a trained athlete. It had little or no neck and the head was leaning forward. Its left arm was curled in front of it like it was carrying something. He described the hair as being reddish-brown in color, around six inches in length, and was very matted in appearance. The animal also had an undercoat that was grayish-white in appearance. The witness did this sketch soon after the sighting to keep the details fresh in his mind, which was suggested by a fellow investigator. The witness turned around shortly after realizing what he had seen, he drove back to the spot but the sasquatch was not there. He stayed in the area and went down the road a few hundred yards and pulled over and listened, hearing nothing he did a howl and coyotes immediately responded from a close distance. He traveled farther down the road, spotting a wild boar feeding on side of road. He then stopped around 1/4 mile from sighting and listened and did another call and had a response from what he described \"as loudest owl call I have ever heard\". He stayed in the area for four hours, but saw and heard nothing further.He returned the next afternoon to investigate with a friend during daylight hours.They found some mashed down vegetation and a kicked over rock on the steep bank. No footprints were found due to the extremely dry and hard packed ground. He was also looking to see if there was any brown vegetation in the area of his sighting, but everything was very lush and green being early summer in the Appalachians.The BFRO received Report #49148 6 days later on June 29th from hikers around 6-7 miles away reporting possible Bigfoot activity.  We feel that these two reports are more than coincidence. I have attended two expeditions in the Nantahala National Forest that were very close to these two sightings. The area is very rugged terrain with high peaks and river and stream bottoms. There are numerous rock outcroppings, and cliff overhangs. The Appalachian Trail is extremely close to these two sightings. It has long been believed by sasquatch researchers to be a North-South highway for Bigfoots. Numerous animals including whitetail deer, wild pigs, black bear, and many smaller animals inhabit this area. In summer months there are lots of edible plants, and berries. With all this food, cover and waterways, it is perfect habitat for a large bipedal primate.",

It was very cloudy that morning with heavy dew rising. I was driving the speed limit 35mph looking for local wildlife like I do every morning. I might add this area is thickly wooded, but also is dotted with many homes. The area is also close to the river. I noticed a very tall shadowy figure approaching a group of cows with a calf. It was at least 8 to 9' tall and about 48 to 50\" wide at the shoulders. I slowed down as much as possible. It saw my brake lights and turned to look at me. I am a good judge of distance for I am a bow hunter and I estimated it to be 45 to 50 yards away. It had a long sloping forehead and very defined brow ridge. I could not tell what color its hair was but I noticed a long beard and its arms hung down to almost his knees. I struggled to get my phone out to take a picture by the time I got it out it turned and walked into the woods. I think it might have been going for the calf. There are many water sources in that area and abundant wildlife in those woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I reached the witness via phone on the evening of 7/2/2014, a little over two weeks after the sighting. The details were very fresh in his mind.The witness was driving to work at 610am on the morning of the sighting. The area is heavily forested, the treeline beginning typically 10 feet from the roadway. Most of the area is private land, the forest is dotted with occasional houses and meadows.It was cloudy, but there was ample light from the sunrise behind the clouds. It had been raining heavily for several straight days prior, but was not on this morning. It was in the high 70's and very humid (very typical for this region at this time of year), which resulted in a visible \"dew rise\", or ground fog. The witness had his headlights on.The witness drives a new Ford F-150 truck with an EcoBoost engine - witness says it is a very quiet engine and may, in combination with the dew rise, have attributed to the Sasquatch not hearing him coming.As the witness approached a clearing, he noted several cows grazing in a fenced meadow adjacent to the road 150 feet from him. Right away he say a huge figure standing amongst the cows, seeming moving towards a calf. The figure did not make any indication it noticed the witness' truck coming. The witness says he calmly slowed the truck to a stop even with the creature, looking at it out of his open window.The witness works with an enormous man - he stands 6'8\" and weighs 500lbs. The witness says the creature stood at least one full foot taller (approx. 8ft) and weighed at a minimum 100lbs more. He said the creature stood entirely upright and was not crouching or bent over. The creature's hands were straight down, hanging to about its knees. He describes the creature's hands as huge, \"large enough to palm a watermelon\". The witness assumed the creature was male due to its enormous size and lack of female anatomy.He described the head as huge, with a sloping forehead and a broad, pronounced brow. Nothing particular was mentioned about the eyes. He said there was no visible neck, just head atop massive shoulders. He said the creature was almost entirely one dark color - like blackish - and very hairy. He said the only area that was not covered in thick black hair was the chest area... he said that area was either a lighter color hair or the hair was thinner, exposing more skin; he could not make out which for certain.A unique observation was that the creature had a distinct beard. It was the same color as the rest of the hair, started just below the cheeks and extended to the chest area. He described it as very distinct and scraggly.He said the creature seemed to notice him when he applied the brakes. The witness feels the creature saw the bright LED brake lights. It watched the witness as he pulled to a stop, then calmly turned and walked back in the other direction. The witness made a point of saying it walked calmly, did not run, in casual, long strides. It walked near a farm house and disappeared into the woods behind it without turning around again.Interestingly, the cows never seemed alarmed or afraid. The witness was unable to follow on foot because it was private property clearly marked as no trespass. The sighting area described as being surrounded by ripe, seeding, wild sunflower plants. After a brief time, the witness drove the short distance to work, but said he didn't tell his coworkers as \"things like this might be embarrassing\". The witness was very confident about what he saw, remained consistent as he recounted his story several times, and sounds very credible. He travels to oil rigs for months at a time for work and is about to leave. He has agreed to meet me at the location for a follow up investigation when he returns. I will post a follow up at that time.",
