I had fell asleep and my son said I was snoring.he then shook me a little and said dad something is coming I woke and immediatley heard something big moving through the brush and fast. It came up behind the blind and screamed I immediatley knew it was nothing I have ever heard before my son was almost in tears. It then started stomping so hard it was shaking the ground,and started snapping limbs and grunting and growling. It did not want us there it made that known.as quick as it was there it was gone and so were we.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone, he is 45 years of age and is an avid hunter and outdoorsman.  He is very knowledgeable of the wildlife that inhabits the area.He began the conversation by saying that this was an experience that he nor his 14 year old son would ever forget.  The morning was dark and hazy before the sun had fully risen.  He said that he had fallen asleep in the deer blind when his son woke him saying that something was outside of the deer blind.  Witness said he woke to a screaming roar and the ground was shaking like something was stomping.  The witness stated that he believed that it was within 2 to 3 feet of the deer blind due to the blind moving and shaking each time the stomping was taking place.  The stomping lasted for 10 seconds but felt like an eternity to the witness.  Once the stomping ceased he could hear limbs being snapped as it walked away.  The witness and his son left the area immediately and had not returned until 2 weeks prior to our conversation.  They returned to attempt to hunt with a couple of dogs, while walking through heavy, thick brush they heard what sounded like a large \u0093spitting\u0094 sound.  He told his son to back out from the direction of the sounds.  Each time they would turn their back from the \u0093spitting\u0094 sound they would hear walking in the brush.  He stated that it definitely was on two legs and would stop each time they would stop.  The witness and his son left the area again.  The witness has since returned and has found trees snapped 6 to 7 feet tall and believe that he and his wife have heard possible wood knocks from their home. There have been other sighting the in the area and local legends.  While on the phone the witness also shared that his father in law had a sighting near an old dump site.  Locals refer to it as \u0093Meadow Creek Monster\u0094 and the stories date back to the 1800\u0092s. The area is 2000 to 3000 acres of forest, ponds and meadows.  There is a large amount of wild game on the property and had been closed for hunting until recently.  ",
