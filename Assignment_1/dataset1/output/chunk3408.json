            "Observed": "I was riding in rear seat of car with 3 others, all college students. We all lived same house in Fayette. It was a fri. nite,weather called for heavy snow overnite. We all were from same area about 25 miles away,decided to head there for weekend or would be snowed in at Fayette by morning. We headed south in my brothers car, he drove, Carl [R.] in pass seat, Al [B.] in LR,and I in RR.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Jerry. He and the others got a good look at it as it crossed the road in front of them.He mentioned that it happened during the first big snowstorm of the season. That is significant. Many witnesses I've spoken with over the years saw one during the first big snowstorm of the season. These creatures may be moving around more than usual when the first big snow hits. They may have to move to a zone that is better protected from the weather. And perhaps, not coincidentally, it would be more difficult to follow them in these conditions, because the falling snow covers their tracks within a few hours, or even a few minutes, depending on the rate of snowfall. Other factors making these conditions attractive are: - It's much easier to be very quiet while walking in a heavy snowstorm. - The fresh snow on the ground and in the air absorbs sound.- They are also less likely to encounter humans outside in these conditions.Although the incident happened many years ago, the witness knows another witness who had a sighting about ten years later at an area roughly 6 miles from this location, near Backbone State Park. If there wasn't continuous presence in the area over that period, then at least it was an area that one or more returned to years later. Hence, they may return there at different points in time. I would venture to guess that Backbone State Park would be the best place in the area to look around for tracks.",

He explained to me that the curtains in place were sheer, and he could see the animal peering into the house. He said that the animal was huge, both in width and height. Its width filled the width of the window, and it appeared to be stooped, peering in. He also said that he could make out one hand of the animal, that appeared to be clinched. He could not really see facial detail, but did remember seeing the eyes. Finally, after minutes of looking at the animal as it looked at him, the witness retrieved a 30.06 rifle and actually contemplated shooting through the window to rid himself of the strange animal, only to find it gone.  When his parents returned home, they did not believe him.  The witness stated that he has heard of other encounters in the area. The Colorado River is in close proximity to where he lived at the time of the incident. ",
