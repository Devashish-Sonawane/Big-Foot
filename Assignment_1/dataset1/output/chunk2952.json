I would routinely skip a class on occassion or have a class cancelled, so I would hike the surrounding area in the time frame I had. Usually from an hour to two hours. I would look for indian aritfacts and watch the local wildlife, occassionally seeing coyote, mule deer or javelina.",

            "Follow-Up Report": " Tonight on November 7, 2000, I talked with Jim Groat, who is now a Cartoon Artiest.  He went over his original report from memory, and he seemed to follow it very close.  I asked Jim Groat the following questions, and he related the following:\tWhere did this incident occur?  \"South of Sabino Canyon road, and 1 mile North and East of the Boy's School that Jim attended back in 1975 and 1976.\"What date did this take place?  \"Late 1975.\"What time of year was it? \"Fall of the Year.\"Do you remember the month? \"It was in Late October, or early November.\"Was it day or night?  \"In the morning, between 10:30 and 11:00AM.\"Describe the area in which this incident occurred.  \"It was desert brush with cactus and creosote bushes in a dry riverbed.\" Where about in Pima County, Arizona did this happen? \"North side of Tucson, about one mile North and East of a Boy's school, West of Sabino Creek.\"Near what area? \"Close to the Fenster School area.\"What distance would you estimate you were from this thing when you saw it?  \"About fifty yards.\"What was your first reaction? \"I first smelled a very pungent body odder.  The next thing, I heard was a digging and scrapping sound, and then I heard roots being snapping from the desert plants. At the first sight of it, I thought it was a bear.\"What was it doing?  \"It was kneeling down, and it was using its right arm and hand while it was digging in a gopher hole area.\"  Were you alone when you first saw this?  \"Yes!\" Did it stand and walk on two legs? \"No! When the creature shifted its weight, while it was squatting, I just turned and began running back towards the school.  \" I didn't stay around long enough to find out if it walked or not.\" Did you see it go down on all fours? \"No!  I just observed it squatting or kneeling.\"Was it covered in hair?  \"Yes! Some places were longer than others. Like its bottom hair was shorter than the hair on the arms.\"What color was it?  \"The hair was 50% warm Gray to 50% brown. Some areas were more brownish, like the back of the head and neck.\"How tall would you estimate this thing to have been? \"While it was in the squatting position, it was about five to six feet tall.\" What would you estimate its weight to have been? \"I couldn't tell, but it was big, and it had a gut.\"Did you see any facial features?  \"No! I just observed its right rear side.  The head seemed like it was cone shaped.\"Could you describe them? \"I was looking at its right side, from the rear, and I noticed its ear.  It looked like ours but seemed small as compared to the size of the creature.\"Could you describe the arms? \"They were long and powerful, and looked very muscular.  Hair was about six inches long on the underside of the arm.\"Could you tell if it was a male or a female?  \"No, but it didn't have any breasts.\"About for how long did you see it?   \"For about 15 seconds.\"Did it ever make any noise? \"It was making grunting sounds when I came up on it.\"Did it see you?   \"I don't know?  Not sure, It shifted its body weight, and that\u2019s when I turned and ran back to the school.\" Did you smell anything? \"Yes!  A very strong body odder and dirt smell.\"Did you check for footprints?  \"The teacher and I went back into that area in the Spring of 1976, and we observed several footprints for 50 to 60 Yards. Prints were about five feet apart, and the prints were about 14 inches long.\"Did you report what you saw?  (IE) Parents or any agency?  \"Yes, I told our school secretary that I had just seen a \"Bigfoot\". What was their response?   \"The secretary thought I was crazy.  But, I drew her a sketch of what I had seen.  The teacher that I took to see the prints, said you probably seen something, but it was probably just a hoax.\" In your own words describe what happened.  \"While I was exploring in the Sabino Canyon area. The first thing that I noticed, was a strong body odder, and a dirt smell.  Then I heard it making digging and scraping sounds.  Also, the animal was making a grunting sound as it was breaking   roots which were making a snapping sound.  I looked up and seen this gray brown animal, it was knelling down, and it was digging in a gopher hole area.  My first thought was that this is a bear, but then I realized this was no bear, but a \"Bigfoot\".  That\u2019s when I really got scared.  When its body shifted, I just turned and ran back towards the school.  I then went into see the school secretary, and that\u2019s' when I made a sketch for her, to show her  what I had just seen.\" ",

When we got to camp we set up our tents, and then we proceeded to the campfire.  Since this camp is at the tree line, which is about 10,000 feet, you are not able to build your own fire. You are either at the main fire, or in your sleeping bag, because it is cold.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "During the evening of the 3rd of September, 2003, I talked with a very outgoing mountain hiking young lady who had a strange sighting back in 1992 on Mt. Shasta. The young lady, B.F., didn't put the sighting together until after having a conversation with her friends, who arrived much later at camp than she had anticipated.At the time of the sighting she just thought it was a strange large person with no backpack on, doing things differently from a normal human at that altitude and at those freezing temperatures. B.F. now feels blessed to have seen one of these creatures because she believes that very few people have ever seen one.I asked B.F. some pertinent questions regarding the subject she saw in the meadow on that cold early morning at a high mountain camp.\u00b7 She estimated her distance from the creature at about one hundred yards or less.\u00b7 Her first thoughts on what she observed was that it was her male Indian friend standing in the meadow; he seemed to be staring at her. She said she never said anything to anyone else about what she saw, because at first she thought it was her friend standing there looking at her. No one else saw the creature in the meadow.\u00b7 She observed it for a couple of minutes, and then she said, \"it then just turned and started to walk away, swinging its arms, across the meadow and down into the tree line, kind of like a human.\" At this time, however, B.F. said she thought it looked \"oafy\" walking away. She described \"oafy\" as being like a Herman Munster type of person.\u00b7 I asked if the subject was covered with hair. She thought at first it was her Native American friend, who had long hair down to his shoulders, but said \"it was too dark, and too far away to tell, and too dark to tell just what color it was.\"\u00b7 How tall was it and about how much did it weigh? B.F. figured it was about six to six and a half feet tall and weighed over two hundred plus pounds.\u00b7 She did not see any facial features, because it was just too dark.\u00b7 She described the body as tall with very broad shoulders and a very big chest, and said \"it just swung its arms as a person would do as it walked off.\"\u00b7 B.F. thought the gender was male, but only because she first thought it was her male friend.\u00b7 It never made any noise, and she never smelled anything strange.\u00b7 She did not check for footprints the following day.\u00b7 She only told this story a couple of times to her friends; some believed her and some didn't believe her, but she knows what she saw and is convinced that it was a bigfoot creature.Summary: I am going to go along with B.F. in her rendition of this report for the following reasons: First is the fact that all the people who were in camp at that time were accounted for; they were either in their sleeping bags or sitting around the campfire. Her other friends were still an hour or more out of camp. Secondly, the subject acted differently in response to the freezing temperatures than the people in the camp.Note: When asked to be more specific regarding the lighting conditions, B.F. noted that there was a bright moon, but that the light was still insufficient to see any details at thatdistance.",
