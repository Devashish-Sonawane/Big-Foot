            "Observed": "On May 9th, 2002 at approximately 3p.m. my buddy and I were headed towards Mt. St. Helens.  We had just passed Hoffstead Bluffs heading east and I was looking down into the wash.  The Toutle splits in this area and there was a section that went between a heavily wooded area and the hillside leading to the road.  It is approximately 300 yards to the bottom.  I noticed something walking thru the creek at an angle and heading northeast.  It happened quickly and I yelled instantly to stop.  I saw it for maybe 5 seconds.  I could see the space between its strides and I knew it had to be much bigger than a man from that distance.  The arms were long and it was dark colored.  We didn't get stopped quick enough for both of us to see it.  We scanned the entire area for at least 10 to 15 minutes but saw no other movement.  I could see the area where I assume it left the woods and the ground did appear to have been disturbed.  I could not see the bottom of the hillside where I was standing.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "BFRO Investigators Richard Noll, Alan Terry, Kevin Lindley, Jessica Stark, and Jeffrey Lemley accompanied this witness to the sighting location on May 25, 2002.  Although the witness did have a clear view of the animal as it crossed the Toutle River, the distance to the animal was roughly 1000 yards.  Misjudging this distance is understandable, as the river lies a hundred yards or so below the road, making it rough to estimate.  Of particular interest is that the witness saw the animal moving roughly in an east-northeast direction, directly towards where another sighting occurred just over 2 miles away, and only 9 days later (see Sighting Report #4359).",

Again no success, as we returned to the freeway in Cle Elum I was saying to my friend we need to watch for elk and deer as I have seen some bad wrecks on I-90. We spotted one deer when the next thing my friend said \"what is that\". As I approached the area I spotted the movement along the highway and he looked at me and said \"bigfoot\". As we came closer this creature stepped onto the edge of the highway looking dead off into my friend's face as we passed, me braking, I looked into the review side mirror only to see it take two steps onto the highway. I turned to look back at the road ahead so as not to crash, I returned my gaze to my mirrors only to have it gone from the road. It was not a person or a bear, absolutely not. I have never feared going into the woods but will no longer do my 3:30am hunting trips for turkey by myself ever again, let alone camp alone.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After interviewing both witnesses in great detail about their sighting, I have come to the conclusion that these men have seen something they cannot explain away. Both men are very familiar with the wildlife in that particular area and were very much alert while driving, scanning the shoulder of the highway for deer and elk so as to avoid a collision. Their ability to spot game combined with their high level of concern for their safety adds particular credibility and validity to what they saw. In addition to merely spotting the subject exit the forest, these men watched as the subject approached their vehicle, and what appeared to be a calculated execution of crossing the highway between vehicles in an attempt to avoid being hit. This was most evident as the driver slowed his vehicle to gain a better look at the approaching subject. Both witnesses stated that the subject walked within approximately fifteen feet of their vehicle so as to pass behind it and cross the road. Both witnesses said that it was a deliberate action and seemed to have a sense of purpose and plan, and almost impatient while waiting for their vehicle to pass as other vehicles were quickly approaching. They also stated that the movements were extremely human like, with the exception of the gait\u0085. The driver stated that the steps seemed to precede the upper body as though it was designed for climbing steep terrain. They also noticed that while it was very tall, it did not possess a heavy muscular build, but rather a somewhat lean and almost lanky appearance. Upon closer examination, the passenger, while having a completely unobstructed view, indicated that the whole face was covered in hair. The witness was absolutely sure of this as he searched for eyes in an attempt to make eye contact. Due to the particular angle of the sun and intensity, definition of eyes nose and mouth were not completely distinguishable, but still evident. What struck both witnesses as  particularly amazing was the color of the hair and how it could aid in near perfect camouflage.  Both indicated that there was a multi-colored appearance ranging from dark brown and beige with dark grey peppered throughout. Both indicated that while the hair was rather uniform, it was not thick but somewhat thin in appearance. The overall size impressed both witnesses the moment they made visual contact, but since the subject was traversing very uneven terrain, it was difficult to estimate a somewhat accurate height. When asking the driver about the height, he stated that once the subject reached the paved highway, it was too tall to see the upper torso and based on the visible arms and middle torso, the driver said that the subject was tall enough to lay its arms comfortably across the top of the shell on his full size truck without raising them above a horizontal position. Upon conclusion of my investigation into this report, I find both men to be sane and highly credible in their recollection of the whole event.This is the third insident within a year that has been reported, that I know of, from the Cle Elum area.
