This is not my sighting and I don\u0092t want my name or any of these names used publicly, but felt that this information might add to the database. About 1960, my husband \"Teddy\" (Name changed at request of submitter) and two high school friends (names unremembered) had an unusual experience in the woods outside of Huntsville, Texas.  Ted passed away in 1975, and only told me this story once, shortly after we were married and when he was somewhat inebriated, as the experience was terrifying, and not something he or the other boys wanted to be teased about forever in a small town. He was very technical and good on detail (an electronics engineer for Lockheed at NASA), so I believe the story.",

She restated that the terror her husband experienced at the ranch, during this event, still showed several years later when he told her this story. She believes it was a true incident.",
