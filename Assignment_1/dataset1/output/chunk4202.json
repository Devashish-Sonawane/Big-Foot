            "Observed.1  ": "Such accounts are told by seasoned woodsmen, reared on a lifetime of stalking wild game in the mountain ranges that surround their homes. Such accounts also are told by second- and third generation loggers who are as hardened and rugged as the terrain they work.  Most, but not all, are reluctant to share their experiences. No one wants to be ridiculed for relating the unexplained things they have seen or heard.  So, few admit they have encountered Bigfoot.  And yet stories of close encounters with this legendary creature keep tumbling into the mountain hideaway of Honobia like a never-ending rockslide.  \u0093There is something out there,\u0094 said Harold Yates, a Honobia resident who retired last week after 30 years with the state Forestry Services. \u0093I don\u0092t know what it is, but something is definitely out there.\u0094  Yates hears the stories frequently from neighbors who trust he won\u0092t laugh at their accounts. Yates would never think of laughing. He is still puzzled by experiences he had five years ago while building a log cabin on Little River, a main waterway that snakes through the valley cradling Honobia.  One day Yates was cutting planks on his saw, listening to the piercing sound of wood colliding with a saw blade. He says that\u0092s when he heard a creature seemingly answer him in a deafening sound that mocked his sawing.  On another occasion, in the stillness of night, Yates heard large rocks being slammed into the river below his cabin. The crashing sound continued for 40 minutes and unnerved his family.  \u0093I don\u0092t know what could have made those sounds,\u0094 said the soft-spoken Yates, 51. \u0093That\u0092s the trouble. I don\u0092t know anything that can make those noises.  \u0093I know a bear can\u0092t.\u0094  Logger Randall Wright, 43, tells of tracks he saw in the woods: \u0093They were 151/4 inches long, 7 inches wide - with five toes.\u0094  \u0093I know Bigfoot is out there,\u0094 said Wright, born and raised in Honobia. Whispering, Wright adds with a devilish grin, \u0093And if I see it, I\u0092m going to shoot it, too.\u0094  Wright is serious. He carries a loaded rifle in his truck at all times.  Yates is left with speculation and wonder. He is far from alone in a valley where Bigfoot sightings and strange experiences also have been reported in the neighboring communities of Nashoba, Octavia, Ludlow and Watson.  The Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, which maintains a national database of purported sightings, has collected 58 such testimonials in Oklahoma since 1971. Nineteen of those eyewitness accounts came from the Kiamichi Mountains, which encompasses vast stretches of timberland in parts of Le Flore, Pushmataha and McCurtain counties.  Honobia sits on the Le Flore-Pushmataha county line - literally.  \u0093On one side of the street is Pushmataha County,\u0094 explained Honobia\u0092s postmaster Karen Pierce, 41. \u0093Cross the street and you\u0092re in Le Flore County. Funny, huh? ... But I love it here. It\u0092s so beautiful.\u0094  Honobia\u0092s beauty is matched only by its remoteness. Residents, some of whom received electricity for the first time in 1952, drive 16 miles to the nearest gas station and 20 miles to the nearest ATM.  A trip to a grocery store could be anywhere from 55 to 70 miles, depending on which direction one travels. If they drive east on State Highway 144, they are traveling on the last unpaved highway in the state.  \u0093There\u0092s only one thing wrong with Honobia,\u0094 said Garland Cogburn, a Honobia resident who lives on Little River. \u0093We\u0092re just so far from anything. Other than that, this place is perfect.\u0094  Honobia is nestled in the heart of the Honobia Creek Wildlife Management Area, which includes 130,000 acres of commercial timberland thick with cedar, oak, box elder, and pine trees. Wild hogs, bear, deer, and panthers are some of the animals that roam its rugged terrain. The land is owned by two private forest investment companies - the Hancock Natural Resources Group and Renewable Resources, LLC. - and is managed by the State Wildlife Conservation Department in a unique partnership.  The vastness of the forest is mindboggling; remote enough for a man to wander into and disappear forever. Or, as some would claim, immense enough for an unknown species to live with virtually no detection.  A Bigfoot shooting? Honobia\u0092s stature as Bigfoot territory grew in January 2000 when a local woodsman named Tim Humphreys claimed he shot at a Bigfoot in the woods behind his home.  Humphreys\u0092 encounter was documented by the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, which sent investigators to interview Humphreys and set up a surveillance at his home. Investigators learned the shooting culminated two years of alleged terror by \u0093at least one Bigfoot,\u0094 which had been prowling his property at night.  The avid Honobia hunter said the creature was stealing deer meat from an outbuilding freezer. As time passed, the creature became bolder by tapping on windows and even jiggling doorknobs.  \u0093Tim and his family were genuinely terrified by this Bigfoot,\u0094 said Wright, the logger. \u0093And I have no reason not to believe him ... He saw it and he was armed to the teeth. He had loaded guns on the porch and in the house - everywhere. He had floodlights all around his house.  \u0093He had just had enough.\u0094  Humphreys told investigators he shined a light into the face of a charging Bigfoot and fired his assault rifle at the massive creature from 70 yards away. The Bigfoot retreated into the woods and cut loose with eerie wails.  Soon, similar sounds were coming from other nearby creatures.  \u0093Tim told me they were talking to each other in all kinds of grunts and gibberish,\u0094 Wright said. \u0093Tim said he was afraid to run in there after it. The next morning I went to the spot where the Bigfoot ran and I personally saw blood splattered on trees 9 feet high for about 200 yards. That\u0092s where it was carried away by two other Bigfoots.  \u0093A logger told Tim later he was driving down the road with his truck when he saw two of these creatures carrying a third one across the road. He turned his truck around six times on that road because he couldn\u0092t believe what he was seeing.\u0094  The logger, like much of the physical evidence from that night, disappeared.  A heavy rain the next day washed away any traces of blood, and Bigfoot investigators found nothing more than a mutilated deer in the vicinity where the Bigfoot supposedly fell. Even the Humphreys vanished abruptly, leaving refrigerated food and furniture in their wake.  Neighbors tell conflicting stories about the family\u0092s whereabouts.  \u0093Tim just grew tired of people laughing and he quit talking,\u0094 said Charla Wright, Randall\u0092s wife. \u0093I know this: Tim\u0092s wife was terrified and she wouldn\u0092t go back to that home after what she saw. And I believe her. I believe they saw a Bigfoot.\u0094  Television media crews and print journalists soon began appearing in Honobia, leaving a legacy of their own with campy or playful reports that made locals feel embarrassed.  \u0093People will make fun of you,\u0094 Yates explained. \u0093I know I\u0092ll never go on camera again.\u0094  A legacy of encounters The sensational ordeal told by the Humphreys actually was a new twist on an old story around Honobia, where Bigfoot sightings date back hundreds of years. Choctaw elders who lived in the region have been telling legends of mammoth, hairy creatures roaming the Kiamichi Mountains for generations.  Charlene Cusher, a Choctaw from nearby Watson, remembered hearing one such story from her grandparents. They spoke of a little boy who wandered into the forest and got lost.  \u0093When they found the boy he was fine,\u0094 said Cusher, 54. \u0093He said \u0091that thing\u0092 took care of him, referring to the creature ... As for me, I\u0092d have to see it to believe it were true.\u0094  Fellow Choctaw Billy Ludlow of Honobia became a staunch believer in Bigfoot 54 years ago at age 11 when he encountered a gigantic, bipedal creature on Little River. Ludlow and two playmates were goofing around one Sunday night after church when they heard metal beams snapping on the unfinished bridge above.  \u0093I looked up and saw this large, hairy animal stand up on two legs like a man,\u0094 said Ludlow, 65. \u0093I\u0092d guess it to be 9 or 10 feet tall with broad shoulders and hair all over. I was always the slowest runner among my friends. But on that night, I was the fastest.\u0094  \u0093We ran to my grandmother\u0092s cabin and slammed the door shut. It was chasing us. Something came and pushed the door two or three times, and then went away. I know they are out there.\u0094  The proof? Proof of Bigfoot\u0092s existence in these mountains - or at least proof of an unknown animal - might be on the way.  Ludlow hunter Odell Rose recently collected a fistful of fine, woolly brown hair on a tree he couldn\u0092t match to any known animals in the region. The foul-smelling hair intrigued Rose so much he has sent it to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization for DNA testing.  Rose, 65, said he doesn\u0092t believe in Bigfoot.  \u0093Odell and I have lived up here for 20 years,\u0094 said LaVelle Rose, 53. \u0093We used to ride mules and horses all over these mountains, and we\u0092ve never seen anything like a Bigfoot. My husband is one of those hard-core people who doesn\u0092t believe in much. He\u0092s from the old school.  \u0093But he\u0092s never seen any hair like this before. He\u0092d like to know what it is.\u0094  Rose laughed, \u0093Maybe it is Bigfoot hair.\u0094 ",
