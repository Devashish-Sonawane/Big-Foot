            "Observed": "I was driving towards Show Low on US 60 about 2:00 in the afternoon on March 24th, 2010. I always look out into the trees in hopes of seeing deer and turkeys, but this time I saw something a bit more out of the ordinary. I saw a very large and tall animal which was about the same redish brown color as a Herford cow, standing about halfway behind a large pine tree. Its arm was very long and it was probably 7ft or more in height. I hit the brakes and slowed way down to get a better look and when doing so, it rotated to make itself more hidden from view. It was too large for the tree it was behind, and now it was visible on both sides of the tree. It definately saw me. I couldn't see its eyes, but it kept its head visible to look at me. Cars were coming so I had to move on.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I was able to speak by phone with the witness four days after the sighting. The following details may be added:\u0095\tThe witness is a hunter who is very familiar with local wildlife.  He has driven this route at least once a month for the last 14 years.\u0095\tThe sighting area was just south of the burn zone of the Rodeo-Chediski Fire of 2002.  The witness was headed north and the bi-ped was on his side of the vehicle\u0097or west side of the highway.  The terrain was relatively flat from the road to the animal.  \u0095\tThe witness saw the bi-pedal animal standing behind about a 2' wide pine tree. He hit the brakes and was then about perpendicular to the animal. It appeared to be looking at him and turned to be more behind the tree, but it was too large to be hidden by the tree. He could still see its right side and left shoulder. \u0095\tThe witness described the animal as having:1)\ta \u0093human-like shape\u00942)\tbroad shoulders with muscular, big and bulky arms3)\tarms which hung down far below the waist and \u0093did not hang straight as ours do but more like a gorilla\u0092s\u00944)\tno visible neck.  The wide head was just a \u0093bump on its shoulders\u00945)\tdark red hair, two to three inches long.  The color of the hair was something very different than what he normally sees in the forest.  He compared the color to Hereford cattle except darker red.  The hair seemed to be \u0093ratty with licked spots\u0094.\u0095\tAt this point, the bi-ped stuck its head out from behind the tree and looked toward the witness again.  He saw the face, but no details of the face, only hair.  \u0095\tThere is a barbed wire fence along the highway and the bi-ped was standing approximately 10 to 15 yards past the fence line\u0097putting the animal about 30 yards off the highway.  He estimated the 7\u0092 plus height of the animal based on the fence height\u0097which comes up to the bottom of his ribs.  The witness is 5\u00927\u0094.  In his opinion, the animal could place a hand on the fence and step over.\u0095\tThe detailed sighting lasted at least 30 seconds before the witness had to move on.\u0095\tWhen he returned three hours later, the witness stopped but was wearing a suit and did not want to risk tearing it climbing through the fence.  There was no snow on the ground at this location to easily see tracks from the fence line.Before this occurrence, the witness believed that in the vast forests of Arizona, the USA and the world, there are probably unknown species of animals unconfirmed by the scientific community.  Now he is certain.",
