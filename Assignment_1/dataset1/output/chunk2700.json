            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness via phone. I got a few other pertinent facts from him for clarity and or questions people may have when reading the report. He has replayed the event \"a thousand times\" in his mind and he, and his son, are certain of what they saw. He indicated he was 75-100 ft. past the warehouse when the creature leaped across the road. Came from right to left. They saw it about 3 seconds after passing the warehouse. It \"came form nowhere\" and was mid air when they saw it at the right front of truck. As stated, it \"cleared the road in one leap\". The road is about 14-15 feet wide. He was driving about 35-40 mph. The road is the type of country road where vehicles coming towards each other will veer to the right to give each other enough room to pass each other. At it's closest point to the truck was about 2 feet at the drivers side front fender. Once it hit the other side of the road, it took another step and disappeared into the brush. The brush consisted of weeds and cat tails, about 4.5 to 5 ft.tall. His windows were down and he did not hear any thrashing or movement once it was in the brush. They did see it \"split the grass\", and then it was gone. Length of sighting was 2-3 seconds, and \"clear as a bell\". Description: Reddish brown as stated, with \"fine hair, not real thick\". Hair was \"flowing in the wind\" as it passed in front of the truck. Skin was \"dark like a dogs nose\" and the hair was \"matted in places\", but it was hair, not fur. Other descriptions in his report are the same, muscular, 4-5 feet tall, upright on 2 legs. He clearly stated to me that an orangutan is the closest thing to what they saw. He felt it was a juvenile.They sat there for a few moments, hoping to see it again, or possibly another one (adult?) trailing behind. Momentarily considered getting out and walking into the reeds and weeds, then decided to move on. He and his son, now 19, discuss it form time to time. The still have unwavering opinion as to what they saw.",

            "Observed": "Me and 3 of my friends were hiking up Rock Canyon.  It was around 10:00pm and we were about 1 1/2 hours up the canyon, just before the rock canyon camp ground.  I remeber that there was no snow in the valley but once we got that high up, there was about 6 inches of hard, crusty snow on the trail.  I remember we had to talk louder than normal to hear one another over the loud, cruch of our feet walking on the crunchy snow.  We heard a noise that was so loud, but so far away it easily silenced our loud conversations with eachother and we instantly stopped in our tracks on the trail and looked at eachother as we all hear this loud noise.  The noise started off sounding like a loud motorcycle way off in the mountain range and then in morphed into a mechanical like scream.  I wish I could impersonate it so you can hear somewhat of what it sounded like but all I have are words.  The noise lasted for about 15-20 seconds.  It was SO LOUD but so far away you could hear it's massivness echoing throughout the entire back mountain range.  When the noise stopped, we all instantly started running down the mountain and didnt stop till we got to the bottom.  We were all 20 years old plus and we ALL heard something unlike anything we have ever heard before that was scary enough to make us all run down the mountain.  We all talked about it once we left the canyon and no one could think of any logical explanation or animal that could have made the noise.  To this day will all admit we heard something up Rock Canyon that night, we just dont know exactly what it was.",

I have no doubt whatsoever that he and his friends had the experience he described, and I believe that what they heard may very well have been a bigfoot.The witness said that he and his friends went back to the area on multiple occasions and at various times of day with video cameras and recording devices but didn't get anything (except for scared). The witness said this experience has been on his mind ever since it happened. He spent a lot of time trying to figure out what made the sound and, as he stated in the report, when he heard a bigfoot recording on the internet he got chills up his spine. He has since spent a lot of time researching and learning about bigfoots.",
