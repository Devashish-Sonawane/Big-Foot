            "Follow-Up Report": "They were travelling westbound on I-84, having just passed Multnomah Falls in the Columbia River Gorge at 9:15 p.m. on 01/09/02 when this sighting occurred. The son, Jason, was driving.  Conditions were dark, overcast, dry, and calm. Appoximately four miles west of Multnomah Falls, both occupants of the car observed a very tall, two-legged creature crossing the freeway in front of their car, and heading toward the Columbia River which closely parallels the freeway.   ***On the return trip from Portland to their home, the witnesses determined that the creature actually crossed at mile marker 29 on west bound side. Appoximately 300-500 feet west of marker. I-84 (Multnomah Falls is at mile marker #31.)***The driver estimated his speed to be 65-70 mph.  He did not swerve and he missed hitting the creature by an estimated two feet.  The creature reached the guard rail as they lost sight of it behind their moving auto.  The motorists quickly phoned their husband/father on their cell phone and relayed the incident.  Husband/father was at home in Idaho, and knowing of the  BFRO website he immediately submitted the report to the BFRO.  I'm a Portland area researcher and happened to  turn on my computer at 10 p.m. not long after the report was submitted.  In the report, the husband in Idaho has  included the cell phone number of the witnesses in their car, so I was able to reach the witnesses by phone while they were still travelling.  I reached them as they were nearing  their destination in Hillsboro, OR on Portland's west side.They were still in a very excited state when I spoke to them forty-five minutes after the sighting.  I spoke with both witnesses. Being from out of state and having just arrived in the greater Portland area, they wanted to know if we see these things around here all the time.  I said I didn't think so. They reiterated the description of what they had seen just as it was stated in the original report.  They emphasized that it was very tall (8-9ft), broad in the shoulders but skinny at the waist.  it was completely covered in dark brown hair which resembled that of a moose in length and shade. Jason described a rounded, dome-shaped head.  He noted the swiftness of it's motion and a swinging of the arms as it crossed the freeway.  Neither witness could see any facial features.  It ran swiftly and smoothly on two legs and was certainly not a bear.  The skinniness and towering height of the creature they observed was particularly remarkable to them.They noticed another car and a truck travelling in their direction a short distance behind them.  They did not see these other vehicles react to the creature crossing the roadway.I am quite familiar with this portion of I-84 and the Columbia River Gorge. There have been other such sightings of bigfoots crossing the freeway  along this stretch.  It is speculated that the bigfoots may be intending to swim across the Columbia River in this general area below Bonneville Dam where the river is narrow and free of development on both banks.I would encourge interested parties to look for fresh tracks on Sand Island in the Columbia River and on the river bank on the Oregon side at the earliest opportunity.The speed with which this report was reported to the BFRO website and then verified by this investigator is most unusual. I was able to interview both witnesses just forty-five minutes after their sighting. This triumph of modern telecommunications would not have taken place without the quick actions of the witnesses and their husband/father Andrew Boydston.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was driving toward Lake Esler, when his truck got stuck in the overflow. It was late June 2012, and the water was running very fast out of the lake and down a ravine.  He had to leave the truck, and walk out for help as the truck got flooded right up to the floorboards.Google earth image of the location:The next morning at around 10:30, he and two friends came back to tow his truck out.  As they hooked up the truck, they discovered a large footprint about 30 feet from the truck.  The witness is a Native Montanan. He is a hunter and a prospector, and he knew the print was very fresh.  He and his friends speculated that the sasquatch walked down the fast flowing ravine to the truck. It seemed to them that the sasquatch had been looking at it when they came back, scaring it away. They could see that it had taken one more step over a snow bank into the woods. They both felt it was nearby and watching them as the woods were, \u0093just too quiet\u0094 that morning.The photo is of the print with his cowboy hat next to it. His hat is 10 inches wide.While getting the details of this report, I asked him what he thought the print was of when he first spotted it. He said he knew exactly what it was as he had seen a bigfoot in 2000.  He was hunting near Deerhead Lake that summer, and from a hill he thought he saw a bear clawing at a stump.  He was about 100-150 yards away and he stopped to watch it. After a few moments, he realized it was not a bear.  It was dark chocolate brown, squatting down and bending over the stump, hitting the stump with a chunk of wood. He watched it pick things from the stump and put it into its mouth. He assumed it was eating bugs of some sort. Its back was to him, but he could see it used its right hand to hit the stump. It was very muscular, and had very broad shoulders that he estimated at 5 feet wide. It moved just as a man would.As he watched, its body language changed. It stopped eating and stood up revealing it to be 8 \u00bd -9 ft. tall. The witness states that it turned to look at him, and threw down the wood as if it was angry. The witness says it literally stomped away in a fast clip like a kid that was having a tantrum. The witness adds, \u0093I could tell he was mad at me for watching him!\u0094 It was too far away for facial details. He believed the stump was of a spruce tree.The witness is very familiar with the flora and fauna of the Montana mountains.  I found him extremely credible, and knowing.",
