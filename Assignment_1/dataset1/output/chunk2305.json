I estimate its stride at about 5 or 6 feet at a liesurely gate. Telling my wife and daughter what i was seeing my wife looked over and saw the same thing I did.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness and his wife on the same evening call. His original sighting of a similar animal was a week earlier than than this reported one. He believes he had seen this same creature carrying a deer carcass around dusk and within a mile or so of this submitted report. Witness described them both as about 9 ft. tall or taller. His frame of reference for the height was a highway sign it had passed as it was carrying the carcass. The sign was the standard green sign announcing the approaching towns and was supported by 2 4x4's. This investigator stood by a similar sign with arms extended overhead and I was still short of the top by at least a foot. The coloring was black or very dark brown with silver or grey hairs as secondary coloring. He assumed it was an older creature because of the grey. He assumed the carcass the creature was carrying was one he had seen by the road a few days earlier because the deer carcass was gone from the spot he had seen it before. The witness mentioned the first sighting only after a good amount of conversation took place between us. I felt he was not comfortable discussing it at first. The second sighting he reported was the exact same creature as far as he was concerned, the coloration being the deciding factor. This time the creature was in an open field along a highway. There was another dead doe and 2 fawn along the highway and the creature was walking away from their location. The creature walked until it was about 400-500 ft. from the witness in the field. When the creature stopped and looked back, he noticed a buck and deer that were standing under some trees that the creature was walking towards. They were frozen in their tracks. His wife was driving, and he pointed the creature out to her, she saw it momentarily, though she did not see it at first. Teenage daughter was in the back seat, texting, and did not see it, nor even bother to look up. Sighting lasted 45 seconds to a minute. Other physical traits were shorter legs in relation to body length, very thick and muscular. Tall upper torso, and the creature had a very odd gait, as though it was \"falling forward\". It covered 5-6 feet with each stride. The weight was estimated to be easily in excess of 500 lbs. The witness and his wife have a lot of stories going back to the 70's & 80's regarding sightings in this general area. As a matter of fact and coincidence, I received another report a week or so earlier totally unrelated to this one. This report was in a town 40 miles from the witness' current home and sightings.  He was familiar with some landmarks and had stories from that town, and as a child was told not to go near certain abandoned buildings where the \"wild hairy people\" lived. ",
