            "Follow-Up Report": "I visited the location and spoke to the witness and her cousin in person. They were very interested in sharing what they heard and described it as something that \u0093had a lot of power\u0094. Although Linda was a long way from the pond, the sound gave her a real feeling of uneasiness and dread and she left quickly. The area is sparsely populated with some new construction of individual homes along the road they live on. The home is only a couple years old itself. During the interview, Linda\u0092s cousin Cris revealed that she had also heard howls behind the home toward the pond the same day earlier in the morning. Cris stated hers was similar to the 1973 Puyallup recording but the pitch was a little deeper.  Both have heard Coyote howls and after listening to various owl sounds and other animal sounds, including other local animals, they both identified the 1973 Puyallup Howl as being the most similar. They also revealed that Cris\u0092 niece heard a similar howl around June/July 2005.I hiked back to the pond where the howls were coming from as well as the creek it flows into. It was a cold rainy day and the dirt road was impassable. The pond was maybe 2 acres in size. I saw evidence of fishing and 2 old johnboats next to it. There was a dilapidated shed I checked out that held an old piece of carpet. I found no hairs or other evidence there.  I found no tracks, yet saw 2 odd shaped tree structures;  one which broke off yet still had leaves on the end of it. It was against another tree along with individual sticks placed next to it. This structure was at the top of the embankment leading down towards the creek. I followed the creek, which was small for about 500 yards until it ran through private property on a farm. The creek eventually flows into the Flint River.  Linda had mentioned there was rumor of a cave in the area as well.This howl was heard by three witnesses on three separate occasions within the same timeperiod in 2 years. The possibility exists for some type of migratory pattern due to the time frames. Both Cris and Linda said they will try and have a recorder handy should they hear the sound again.They said they would let us know. I appreciate their hospitality and willingness to help.",
