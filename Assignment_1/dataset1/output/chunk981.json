We heard an erie yell, it sounded to me like a bigfoot call.  Only two of us heard it, as I said, our window was down.  We only heard it once, which was enough for me.  I went back the next day with the other friend and found a trail leading to an area with pole-sized trees downed by something, with some going one way, others another and on top of each other.  I don't go on that trail anymore, not even during the day.  That yell was inhuman.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On June 28, 2013 I spoke with Daniel regarding the recent incident.  At about 10 pm he and two friends drove out to the parking area at Eagle Lake to hang out, not party. Daniel was in the back seat and the windows were down on the passenger side. After about fifteen to twenty minutes he and the passenger heard a loud, very distinctive scream-like howl, which was more human than animal, and that lasted for about thirty seconds.  The howl sounded like it originated in a heavily wooded area between the parking lot and a boat ramp to the east, and not too far from the shoreline.  Whatever made the howl sounded to be about fifty yards away because it was very loud.The next morning Daniel and the other witness went back to the location to see if they could determine where the howl came from, and found a spot about fifty yards from where they were parked.  Several small trees recently had been physically torn out of the ground and strewn about or snapped off. The damage didn't look at all like storm damage, rather as if someone pulled some of the trees up out of the ground and tossed them aside.Daniel added that the only time he's heard a howl like the one he heard was online which prompted him to file the report.I visited the area with some direction from the witness and took some photos, this is the parking lot where Daniel and his friends were parked when they heard the howl:The area near the shoreline where the howl was heard and several trees had been twisted and snapped off:Eagle Lake is a 575 acre lake located in Vilas County, eighteen miles south of the Wisconsin-Michigan border. The area is densely wooded with an abundant deer population.July Update:On 7/16/2013 Dan and his girlfriend went back to the location just after twilight time to check out if they could hear the creature again. They parked east/west, which would give them a clear view of a footpath leading from the lot and to a boat ramp.  His girlfriend shut off the ignition, and after about thirty seconds she started up car and left right away. After driving for about three miles she explained that she saw something very large and appearing to be covered in hair, walking on the path.  It appeared to be about fifty yards away and was walking upright towards the car.  The path where the tall figure was seen:Unfortunately the now ex-girlfriend was unavailable when I attempted to interview her.",

            "Observed": "Several Bigfoot were observed with binoculars in a deeply wooded area. They were dodging in/out of the tree line, like a game of cat and mouse, with each other. Thought it was a hoax being played on me and just watched them move closer in my direction. We also heard some cackling noises in the distance that I likened to hyenas or coyotes. Separate from these noises were dogs barking in the area. Horses in the area that became real jumpy. After walking into wooded area, we disturbed a large creature that let out a very deep and loud growl that I've never heard any animal make before and we heard a loud thud like a heavy animal jumping. Shots from a .45ACP handgun were fired in the vicinity followed by heavy footsteps and branches/brush being disturbed by the same heavy animal making a hasty retreat. We went into the same distance and reached a creek bed area. There was dead silence and we noticed some smudged prints near the water's edge but didn't hear a splash or any other noise. We got the feeling that we were being watched and feared that whatever we were following had doubled back on us and might corner us with our backs to the water. By this time, it was darker outside but in the more open areas you could see without a flashlight. As we were leaving the area, we heard very heavy footsteps and stomping along with tree branches crashing to the ground that I likened to a bull dozer without the engine rushing behind us. We got to a clearing and turned to face whatever it was and saw a HUGE, silver-grayish colored Bigfoot just at the tree line. It was in the 10 O'clock position from where we were and it was stomping and \"bluff charging\" or \"mock charging\" at us and throwing branches. The trees in this area were middle growth to mature trees and he (appeared to be male by the aggressive nature and sheer size...) was rattling these trees with no problem! We squatted down to get a better look and to take aim at him in case he charged. He stayed within the tree line and rocked back and forth like a gorilla. The only sounds that were heard, at this point, were the stomping and the branches being thrown at us. He was about 20 yds. away from us and the large branches were coming very close. I had the gun aimed right at him and I'm convinced that he had a better sighting on me than I had on him because he reacted just like a squirrel on a tree does. I was thinking about taking a shot at him when suddenly from the 12 O'clock position, we noticed another Bigfoot that was shorter than he was and wasn't as thick, up top, and appeared to be female because of (her) actions. The larger one(10 O'clock position) was at least 8 or 9 feet tall and was very massive in the shoulder areas. The smaller one(12 O'clock position) was at over 7 feet tall and was standing there rocking back and forth, but not as violently as the larger one. (seemed like she was following his lead and waiting to see what he would do next....) As long as I pointed the gun in their direction or shined a flashlight at them, they stayed behind the trees and tried to hide their faces. It became a sort of hide-n-seek as I shined the light to see their faces. I did catch a glimpse and the face appeared more sloth-like, from what I saw. They had BIG heads, the eyes were dark looking despite the growing darkness and flashlights. On one, I did notice a sort of frowned expression on the face and it almost looked sad. At this point, I couldn't shoot because I wasn't sure that it still wasn't a hoax, although I understood what I was looking at. Also, it almost seemed like they could almost understand things more than other animals. (I won't say they were thinking and reasoning.....) But, it was as if they were upset that I shot at them and was asking me \"WHY?\" The larger one (10 O'clock position) became more agitated and wanted us out of the area and began to stomp more and more, so we decided to slowly back out of the area (with gun pointed in their direction) and leave. As soon as we got out of the area, we then heard what I likened to a loud shouting type of horse whinnying shout. That I labeled their victory call, for running us out of the area. I had a camera hanging from my neck but didn't touch the camera until I got home and noticed it hanging from my neck! I was very much afraid and wasn't sure if I'd make it out of there alive or not.",
