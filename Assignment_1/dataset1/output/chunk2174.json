            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness about his sighting on two separate occasions following his son's initial report submission. He had driven into an area northwest of Cleveland to search for Native American artifacts in an area that had been recently clear-cut, and had spent some time there. It had rained very recently in the area, and oftentimes artifacts like pottery or arrowheads will be much easier to find as they are more exposed in freshly dug dirt that has endured heavy rainfall. As he was driving out of the area along what was (at the time) a Forest Service road, he noticed a large, dark animal moving downhill towards a creek that ran through the area. He was immediately struck by its size, and moreover by its gait. The animal moved very quickly, and remained upright for the duration of the sighting. He described the creature as \"well over six feet tall\", and darkly colored; almost black. As it walked, it bent its torso forward, as if trying to reduce its profile slightly. It swung its arms considerably as it moved.  The witness watched it cross a distance of about seventy-five yards before it slipped into a tree line bordering the creek. He drove across the creek to watch the opposite side of the tree line, but the creature never emerged from the trees. The witness was startled by what he saw, and decided not to exit his vehicle to look for the creature.The areas immediately surrounding the location of the sighting are National Forest areas with rich landscape and several documented sightings. The exact location of this sighting has since been developed, and a small lake sits in the area that was clear-cut at the time. ",
