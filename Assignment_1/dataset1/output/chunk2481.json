            "Follow-Up Report": "An event earlier in the month preceded this sighting at the end of May 2005.  At that time, the mother of the witness and her boyfriend had heard something lurking in the woods near the house that ran away when they tore up some cardboard to fuel a fire.  Their opinion was that the sounds created as it ran were bipedal and indicated significant weight.  A few minutes after hearing it run away the couple heard a loud howling sound.  The witness stated he had joked with the boyfriend about a howling Bigfoot up until the night he heard the howl and had the sighting a few minutes later.Initially, the witness thought he was observing a telephone pole along the road as he left his mother\u0092s home.  He described what he saw as being the color of a heavily creosoted pole.  He approached it for an estimated five to ten seconds.  At a distance of approximately 25 feet, the creature jumped off a 4' embankment and ran across the road in three or four steps.  He further stated that he nearly collided with it, as it was as close as 10 feet to the front of his jeep.  It was illuminated by high beam headlights during the encounter and he did get a good look at it in profile and then slightly from the rear.  He estimated that five seconds elapsed between when it jumped and when it disappeared into a field on the other side of the road.  His vehicle speed during the encounter was approximately 35 \u0096 40 miles per hour.  The road is a typical rural road in Ohio, 12 - 14 feet wide in pavement with gravel shoulders to allow cars to pull off enough to pass each other.JW described the creature as being a very dirty, dark brown, almost black.  In profile, it did not have a snout and the head flowed directly onto the shoulders and chest with no neck evident.  He described the hair as coarse and similar to an Airedale\u0092s coat.  His estimate of the height was seven feet and the weight in excess of 300 pounds.   The head had a conical quality to it, but it was rounded at the very top.  He described the posture as that of a big, muscular man with a back problem as it ran bent over leaning forward.  He observed the arms bent and pumping and could clearly see that it had hands and fingers, although the angle of observation only allowed him to see the top of the hands, which were hair covered.  The witness says that the animal did not look at his jeep during the encounter and he did not see facial features or eye shine.His initial reaction was one of disbelief as to what he had observed.  When he returned home his wife stated he was visibly agitated.  He immediately called his mother and told her to be sure that she locked the doors.  He said her boyfriend mentioned he should check the BFRO sounds page and he stated the howls there were very similar.  He decided to submit his report after listening to those sounds and completed the report during that same visit. The area of the sighting is near a small city but is rural in nature with rolling hills, pastures, crop fields and woodlots.  There is a pond and a small creek adjacent to the site of the encounter.  This area is located south of a cluster of reports in the BFRO database, including the Minerva Monster incidents.Discussion and arrangements to do an on-site investigation are proceeding with the goal of having access to the property hopefully in the next two weeks.For a number of reasons, I found this witness credible.",

From 10 yards (or so) away between two trees a blackish figure (8 feet tall) moved and I saw it directly for only a split second. The cat we were with was on a tree stump near by and was looking right by where we saw it and her hair was all puffed up. Then we heard two splashes together (it crossed a puddle). Then the neighbor's dogs ran up to the fence (out of sight) and one barked, then the sound was repeated but in a more girthy tone, and then it was repeated over and over again on different sides of the lake. then everything got louder and very intense and we heard a cow moo from across the lake and they don't have any cows, then we went inside.",
