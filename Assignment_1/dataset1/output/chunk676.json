The quickest route to my mom and stepdad's house is through Cleveland, Texas and take 105 from there to almost Kountz. [At] approximately midnight,  we left from Kingwood and traveled through Cleveland onto 105.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the male witness 6 April 2004; I spoke with the female witness or \u0093girlfriend\u0094 4 May 2004. Both witnesses corroborated the initial report and added a few, heretofore undisclosed details. While I found both of the witnesses\u0092 testimonies of the event compelling, I found the female\u0092s account particularly so.The female remembered awakening from a state of light sleep. Her boyfriend suddenly stopped the vehicle with an animal standing directly in front of them at a distance of approximately twenty feet. The animal was facing away until it turned clockwise to peer at them. The male witness recalled seeing the animal stand up from a squatting position; the female\u0092s first memory was of their vehicle quickly coming to a stop with the animal in front of them. In an instant, the animal quickly stood up and turned to look at them, though it did not turn completely around.  Though their memory of facial details was scant, both witnesses remember watching the animal turn to quickly look at them before hastily retreating across the road to the right. The girlfriend opened her door and the creature disappeared into the sanctuary of the rich forest of the Trinity River bottoms. The entire incident lasted perhaps twenty to thirty seconds; the amount of time of the actual, visual identification was probably less than ten seconds. I asked the female witness why she exited the vehicle upon seeing a large, unknown animal that was possibly feeding. She had no explanation for her behavior other than to say that the act was certainly out of character for her, and admitted that normally she is \u0093scared of the closet monster.\u0094 The witness further admitted that she was indeed scared when she got out of the car, and her boyfriend attempted to prevent her from getting out, but she went despite his admonitions and her trepidation. She told me that she \"just wanted to see it,\" and perhaps get a better look at the creature. Both witnesses eventually got out of the vehicle and had the \u0093feeling\u0094 that they were being watched (this is a common thread of many reports just prior to or after a sighting). Before returning to the vehicle, the male witness pulled the carcass off the road. Upon entering the vehicle, the girlfriend exclaimed, \u0093Oh my God! It was a bigfoot!! Oh my God, it was a bigfoot\u0085..\u0094Both witnesses have told few about the encounter, for fear of ridicule. The female witness confided in her mother, but was greeted with derision, as her mother tried to convince her that what she saw was \u0093probably a coyote.\u0094 About which, the witness remarked, \u0093I\u0092m sorry, but coyotes don\u0092t stand up and walk off on two legs.\u0094 Indeed. The female witness was quite concerned that I would consider her to be \u0093nuts.\u0094 She seemed quite relieved when I told her that there are other sightings in the immediate and surrounding vicinity. She said, \u0093Thank you, thank you,\u0094 as if she and her boyfriend had been vindicated upon hearing that there are other people out there who have reported seeing something similar to what she and her boyfriend saw that morning in East Texas.

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness over the phone. I know this location very well as I have archery hunted the area many times. This witness is also a hunter, and being retired, spends a lot of time camping and hiking in this general area. When I read his report, I knew exactly where it was.He also noted a reference object, a limb on a tree that it pushed aside, so they could judge the height of the creature. Additional details: he said that the hair on the head was long, like a person with long hair, the body hair was shorter, and course looking, and he could clearly see the long \u0093fringe hair\u0094 on the back of the arms move as it walked. They could clearly see the \u0093fringe hair\u0094 as it pushed the limb to one side. I observed this same \u0093fringe hair\u0094 imprinted on the Skookum Cast. It is like the long hairs on the back of the legs of a golden retriever dog. The color was very dark brown. He said it stood up in a very natural, easy, fluid, manner. It walked with a lumbering, yet lanky walk, with big arm swings. I went to the location, following the witness\u0092 route. I was able to find the exact spot and take some photographs. It was just as described. I followed the trail through the next field and on down to the forest and river. There are a lot of elk trails there, as the elk access the hay fields from across the river. He mentioned that they hurried over to the blackberry patch to see if they could still see it crossing the next field. The distance across that field, going diagonal NE corner to SW corner is about 500 yards. The distance from where the creature was, to the far side of the second field was about 400 yards. It would have had no trouble making it to the river and forest beyond before they could get to where they might observe it further.  This picture shows the berry patch and trees from the vantage point of the witness. This picture shows the berry patch from the opposite side. The arrows depict where the creature moved as it left the area. They got a very good look at the creature. Although it was almost 500 yards away, it was large enough to stand out and be seen clearly. Added to this is the report of the wood knocks and the hooting. With five witnesses seeing the creature, I have no doubt that this was a sasquatch. ",
