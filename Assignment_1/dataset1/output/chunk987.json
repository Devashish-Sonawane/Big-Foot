            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness who was 12 at the time, who decided to come forward after discussing the incident with the other witnesses. The group was was hanging out on the swing set and with their backs towards the nearby woods. They were talking when they all stopped, turned around to face the woods, and standing in apparent mid-stride pose was a brown, muscular hairy creature with a face like a monkey with big, black eyes, like Snowflake the albino gorilla. It was looking down over its left shoulder at them and close enough that it could have taken one stride and be standing with them. He described the arms as very long; it's left arm hanging down at its side and its right arm near it's midsection. He described it as being substantially taller than his dad; maybe two feet taller. He said the hair on its head had a widow's peak, and the face was wrinkled, \"Imagine a 150 year old human.\" Everyone was frozen. The creature was staring at him directly in the eyes. He didn't feel threatened, rather he felt that it was curious. And he knew it wasn't a bear. The day before there was was a bear on the property, and the creature he was staring at could, \"... easily pick up that bear and snap its back.\"Everyone was frozen in place. \"Maybe it was curious hearing kids making noises.\" After a few seconds it turned and quickly headed back into the woods, and the kids ran back to the house.A year later his brother, one of the witnesses, checked out a book about myths and monsters which featured stills from the Patterson/Gimlin film from Bluff Creek, California and instantly knew that the creature in the film was identical to the same one they had seen, and half a continent away.Throughout the interview, I could hear the stress and excitement in his voice, even after all these years.
