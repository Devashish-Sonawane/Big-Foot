            "Observed": "I was riding a bicycle north of [the town of Virginia, MN] on a small dirt road.  I saw a creature about 300 feet to the northwest of me on a hill at the edge of a mixed deciduous and evergreen forest.  It looked at me, turned, crouched, and walked up the hill into the forest.  It looked cautious and apprehensive. It had black fur and a very hairy face more like a man than a bear (It had no snout).  It walked upright like a man.  It was not round in the body as a bear, but more lanky.  Its hard to judge the height, but it was at least as tall as a tall man.  It did not move or look like a bear.  My impression of it at that time was that it had sense of humaness about it, but it was a wild, unkempt, hairy creature.  I was quiet scared at the time and turned and got out of there in the opposite direction.  It looked like the purported Sasquatch I saw on a film strip years ago on TV, but it was not as thick as that one.  It was more lanky.",
