            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness and he restated the story and commented again that the sound had a human quality to it.  He and his brother-in-law were approximately 220 yards apart and each thought the animal making the noise was in the direction of the other hunter.   They were sure there were no other hunters in the immediate area. The witness stated he knows what a bobcat sounds like and stated he was sure it was not a bobcat, which is normally nocturnal in nature anyways.They have hunted the area since with no other strange occurrences.    The one other report the witness is referring to in this area is BFRO Report #7272. The witnesses listened to recordings on the BFRO website and other sites and the closest to what they heard was this clip that was recorded at night by a researcher in the Klamath area of California in 1993, this recording is similar to the Puyallup and Snohomish screams found on the BFRO website.
