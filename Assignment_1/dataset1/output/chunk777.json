It was a few hundred yards off the road before Fish Creek campground, near Troy Meadows area on the Kern Plateau, up the road from Kennedy Meadows. The public campground was about 1 \u00bd miles as the crow flies from us. I believe it was a Wednesday so there were not many other campers on the mountain, and we were on the first day of a motorcycle riding trip. We had spent the day gathering wood, setting up tents and testing out our old motorcycles. Two friends were to join us the next day.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Jim called me tonight January 8, 2008 from Orange County, and we went over his and his friend sound encounter back in 1986 which took place where off road motorcycle folks gather to ride the high back country around the Jackass Peak area of the Sequoia National Forest. The witness gave me a co-ordinance of Latitude 36.034893, and a Longitude of -118.123799 which he got from Google earth. This seems a little off from where I know Jackass Meadows to be located. See below for further information on this matter.The witness heard an extremely loud yell that went into a growl. It repeated 5 or 6 times over a 3 to 4 minute span. Each vocalization lasted around 10 to 15 seconds.  The sound went from a high pitch yell to a low pitch growl with the higher pitch variation each time. It was not rhythmic. This yell/growl was so loud it seemed to come from just outside of their fire circle light, but it was further away. They say they could hear it breaking branches and stepping on leaves and twigs as it moved in the distance. They new it wasn\u0092t a bear or a mountain lion, but they were not sure what it was. They knew it was big and they wanted no part of it.The camp site that these two young men were using was a little more remote that the normal camp sites that most folks use at the Fish Creek campground. It was more like a deer hunter\u0092s camp, but not too far removed from other sites at Fish Creek campground. They said there was no one else in the campground at the time. I have been using this area off and on for about 40 years now camping, off road motorcycling, cutting wood, and deer hunting. I believe the road this witness was referring to is the Jackass Meadow Rd. Jim said that road is now closed, but they were using a portion of Jackass Meadow to camp at. I was using this Jackass Meadow road back in the 1960\u0092s through the 1990\u0092s and even later. This dirt road is on the north side of the Sherman Pass Rd. or better known as the road to the Black Rock Ranger Station, about a quarter mile east of the entrance to the Fish Creek campground.Jim has a job that keeps him outdoors. And then he spends his off time outdoors as well. He is a very credible and believable person, and has a vivid recollection of that night. He has listened to sounds on the BFRO site but did not hear anything close to what they heard that night. In later correspondence he mentioned that he found a YouTube clip with sound that is close.  The sound turns out to be Roger Patterson's simulation of yell/growl he heard in the 1960's. To clarify, this recording is not an actual recording of a sasquatch, but rather a person imitating a sasquatch howl. In this case Patterson was howling into a church steeple to give the vocal some reverb effect.Please click on the link above to view and listen to the recording.",
