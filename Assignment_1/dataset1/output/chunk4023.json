            "Observed.1  ": "The story-telling happened two to three weeks ago at the BP Quick Stop on Alabama Highway 165 in Fort Mitchell, Ala. The women who run the store said a terrified young man came in there around 10:30 p.m. on a Thursday and said he needed to call a game warden right away.  He looked to be about 18, and \"he was petrified,\" one of the women said. The guy said that he and his companion, a man in his late 30s or early 40s, had just fled from Rood Creek Park, a small campground and boat landing across the Chattahoochee River in Georgia, just south of Florence Marina. Fort Mitchell's a fair distance from Rood, but the guy said the Quick Stop was the first open store they'd come to.  He said they had been camped at Rood when his dog, a yellow Labrador retriever, suddenly started making weird noises. It wasn't like the dog was barking; it was more like the dog was screaming or crying. So he went to check on the dog, and when he did, he heard something big coming through the woods.  When it got closer, the guy could see that it was much bigger than he was. (The women in the store said he was about 6 feet tall.) It wasn't clear whether he perceived it to have a human or ape-like form; he just said it towered over him and he could just barely make out its eyes. He said he shot at it with his pistol - firing either two rounds or emptying two clips; the women weren't sure - but the thing seemed unaffected by the gunshots.  It's unclear why the guy went so quickly from hearing something approach to gunning it down. Maybe the creature had injured his dog. What happened to the dog is unclear, too. When I first heard this story, the teller told me \"it took the dog.\" I wasn't sure if that meant it stole the dog, it killed the dog, or it just beat all you'd ever seen.  \"He said it had tore his dog up,\" said a Quick Stop witness. She said she saw the dog, but didn't see any blood on it.  The guy called a game warden from the store, and the warden asked if the two fellows would go back to Rood with an officer to look around, and the two flatly refused and got back in their car and left.  The women at the store have no idea whether there's any truth to this tale, but they said the guys did look scared silly. The older one wouldn't get out of the car, which the campers very carefully had parked under the brightest lights in the lot and as close to the store entrance as they could get.  They said they had fled in such a hurry that they abandoned their camping equipment, and apparently they had. Another Quick Stop customer went down to Rood later and found it, said the women. The women didn't get the men's names and declined to tell me their own, not wanting to become too closely associated with alleged creature encounters. They said one of the men claimed to be from Louisiana, though they were in a car with an Arkansas tag. It looked like a Ford Mustang, the women said.  That's about as far as this story goes. No one else has heard or seen anything like it. I drove down to Rood on Monday and found no one who'd heard about this. One camper on the park's west side said he was there two weeks ago and had noticed nothing unusual. And if he had noticed something unusual, that would not have been unusual, he said: \"There's no telling what they saw. You can see some strange things out here.\"  Two men on Rood's east side said they also had seen nothing odd.  Up the road at Florence Marina, Superintendent Keith Fleming said his workers were running educational tours down at the Rood Indian mounds adjacent to the campground, and they had noticed nothing weird down there, either.  If this was an authentic local bigfoot sighting, it would not be entirely the first. A while back we heard of a fellow out in Russell County who claimed he knew a place off Old Sandfort Road where you could go every evening and see a big hairy hominid go by. But no one's ever thought much of that story because after all, there are a lot of places around here where you can do that.  Beyond that, you don't hear much bigfoot talk here.  Now down in south Georgia and Florida, you hear a lot more. Down in Florida they've got this thing called a \"skunk ape\" folks keep seeing. It's a bigfoot that smells really bad. Like the creature reported here, the skunk or swamp ape shows up in wet, lowland areas. It has been reported often in the Everglades.  There's a Web site that maintains a database of Florida skunk-ape sightings (www.floridaskunkape.com), and some of the stories sound like the one those women at the Quick Stop heard. Dozens of sightings were reported in the 1970s, a popular era for bigfoot interest. But then reports dropped off until the summer of 1997, when there was another rash.  Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp has tales of a creature called the \"pig man,\" also a bigfooter with noticeably pig-like nostrils. Reports of this south Georgia pig man can be found on a Web site called the Okefenokee X-Files (www.okefenokee.com/xfiles.htm). It cites one creature south of the Okefenokee near Palatka, Fla., that's popularly known as \"The Bardin Booger\" after a small community nearby.  If we did find a bigfoot, skunk ape or pig man prowling about, we wouldn't be the first. But we might be far enough away from the others to give our booger his very own name. He could be the Chattahoochee Cootie, or the Rood Dude, or the Creek Freak - if we've got a real critter, that is.  If all we've got is a big stinker who goes around scaring the tourists, well, that's hardly worth bragging about. ",

            "Observed.1  ": "The Times received calls from readers who believe they have seen what may be a Skunk Ape in South Georgia. One reader account came from Brooks County, the other from Berrien County. A Skunk Ape is reportedly a hairy humanoid creature that walks on two legs. It is described as being similar to the legendary Bigfoot, but of slighter build. Skunk Apes grow about seven-feet tall and weigh 200 to 300 pounds, according to witness accounts. The creature is called a Skunk Ape because of the foul odor accompanying most sightings. The smell is described as being similar to rotten eggs. Skunk Apes reportedly love wooded, swampy areas, and the Skunk Ape legend comes primarily from the Florida Everglades. While the Skunk Ape ranks among legendary creatures such as Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, the Mothman, and others, numerous Internet sites report witness accounts. Several sites mentioned recent Skunk Ape sightings along the Withlacoochee River between Quitman and Valdosta in Brooks County. This repeated Internet mention to South Georgia led to The Times story last week. The article led to these subsequent reader accounts. Both sightings occurred prior to the article\u0092s publication, according to these readers. Both readers gave The Valdosta Daily Times their full names. One asked that we not publish his name. We use the first name of the other caller. Did these folks see a Skunk Ape? We\u0092ll share their stories and you decide. \u0095 Between 10-10:30 p.m. Wednesday, April 21, Joy was driving along Highway 37 in Berrien County. She had a friend on her cell phone. Outside of Ray City, she had her car\u0092s bright lights on and she saw something hairy, walking away from the road, into the woods. \u0093I saw the back of something,\u0094 Joy says. \u0093It was tall. ... I thought it was a bear but a bear don\u0092t walk on its back legs. ... Honestly, it looked like an ape.\u0094 Joy said her husband\u0092s about six feet tall and she gauged what she saw to be about the same height as her husband. She didn\u0092t smell anything driving by the creature. She told her friend on the phone that she thought she saw something like a hairy man walking into the woods. Her friend laughed and asked if Joy had been drinking. \u0093I told her I hadn\u0092t been drinking and, sir, I don\u0092t drink,\u0094 Joy told The Times. Joy continued driving that night. She mentioned what she saw to a few people, but didn\u0092t give it much more thought until her mother told her about the article in The Valdosta Daily Times. During daylight, Thursday, April 29, the day after The Times story, Joy and her mother traveled to the same part of the road where she claimed to witness a creature. She said the area has numerous trees and is swampy. Joy believes she saw a Skunk Ape or a creature like it. \u0097 Last Friday, The Times received the phone message from the man in Brooks County who claimed \u0093... I saw it.\u0094 Calling him back, he said earlier this spring, before the leaves returned to the trees, he was smoking a cigar on the back porch of his Brooks County home, three miles outside of Quitman. It was  between 10-11 a.m., when he \u0093saw something walk out of the woods.\u0094 He first thought it a deer but saw that it had no hind quarters. He then thought it \u0093an idiot in a ghillie suit,\u0094 a type of camouflage clothing covered in loose strips of cloth or twine designed to look like foliage. But even then he thought something wasn\u0092t right. He went inside his house and got a pair of binoculars. He saw a hairy humanoid, with the hair being red, fading to brown and grey. The creature was lean and at least over six-feet tall. The creature was probably about 500 yards away, too far away to smell, he said. He watched the creature for about eight minutes through the binoculars. During that time, the creature leaned on one arm against a tree, looking around. It scratched its left calf with its right foot. Then it ran away. \u0093It didn\u0092t walk like a human,\u0094 he said. \u0093It\u0092s joints don\u0092t quite move like a human.\u0094 He said if you throw a sheet over a man or a woman, you can tell the gender by the way the person walks despite the sheet. This creature had a strange walk that did not match the movements of a human, he said. The man thinks the creature is an omnivore, an eater of meats and plants, rather than a vegetarian. A vegetarian has a bigger belly, like a cow, he said. He believes this creature stays lean from eating meat. What kind of meat? The man says he\u0092s taking no chances. \u0093If I go out in the woods now,\u0094 he says, \u0093I make sure to carry something with me that goes bang.\u0094 He believes he probably isn\u0092t the only person to see the creature. \u0093If I\u0092m calling, there\u0092s probably nine other people who\u0092ve seen it who haven\u0092t said a word to anyone,\u0094 he says, \u0093because they don\u0092t want people thinking they\u0092re crazy.\u0094",
