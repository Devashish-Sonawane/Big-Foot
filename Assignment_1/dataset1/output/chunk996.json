            "Observed": "I was camping with 4 friends at Feather Falls campground several miles outside of Oroville.  We were the only ones camping there.  We stayed up late talking and what not and had gone to sleep about 1:00 AM.  Some time later, it was still dark out, I heard what sounded like a tree branch being wacked against the trunk of a tree, it had specific patterns and rhythms...but the interval of time between \"episodes\" was random...I heard similar noises from another spot in the area. I would estimate that these noises were about 300-400 yards away, maybe more.  My friends who heard it, who don't believe in anything they don't see, said it was a woodpecker.  I've heard a lot of woodpeckers, but never at that time of night, or with the irregularity of the sounds.  I didn't hear any vocalizations at all.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness by phone.  The following details can be added to the report:--No other campers were in the campground.  No other cars were in the parking lot.--Witness and friends stayed only one night there.--The \"banging\" appeared to come from two separate locations, one to the right and one to the left.  The banging from the two locations never occurred at the same time (no overlapping).  It appeared that when the right (or left side) would bang out a pattern, the opposite site would repeat it back immediately following.--Although it was difficult to determine, the object being banged against the tree trunk sounded like a large branch, not a small stick.--The \"banging\" pattern was not consistent with the rapid sound of a woodpecker.  The pauses between each bang appeared to be caused by the need to pull back an arm for the next blow.",

This was before all the development was done so we pulled his truck into a clearing (to the left of the main road as you come up on the lake.) We parked and climbed in the bed of the truck.  I would say 15 mins later we heard a rustle in the bushes.  When we turned to look there was a very large animal of some sort.  It was taller then the average black bear and stood like a man.  We litterly sat there froze for a good 2 minutes.  It would turn to the left and walk 3-4 large steps, stop and face our direction.  A few seconds later it would do the same to the right.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness in great detail regarding her encounter.  Although she didn\u0092t observe the creature emerge from the tree line, she did notice it pacing back and forth several times.  She found it particularly interesting how it walked in a very casual and relaxed manner yet still left her and her friend with a very unsettling feeling.  The witness does recall one particular feature regarding the head of the creature.  She remembers specifically that there were no ears present as one would see on a bear.  She said the head was more round in shape.  After departing the area and trying to understand exactly what it was that they had just witnessed, she did regret not directing the vehicles headlights toward the creature for a better look.  Her friend made no attempt to linger around any longer than necessary and upon departing turned the vehicle away from the creature making a complete u-turn and departed the same way he entered.",
