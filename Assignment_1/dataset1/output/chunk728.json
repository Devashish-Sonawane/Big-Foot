The vocals that this witness described were reported to be very loud, 10-15 seconds in duration, and were repeated 3-4 times.  The witness estimated the calls to be coming from an estimated one mile away.  Another person who was also awake at the time also heard the vocalizations.  The sound was reported to be a very deep-toned howl.  He said that he went on several websites to listen to recordings of Pacific Northwest animals.  The only sounds remotely similar were other suspected sasquatch calls.From  what the witness described, I would agree with him that what he heard was most likely a sasquatch.  His description is about the same as I remember from when I first heard a sasquatch vocalize.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness for about an hour on the phone.  He lives in the eastern part of the state, so we were unable to have an in-person interview.  However, I am very familiar with the location of the sighting, which I visited.  This area is a densely wooded area bridging the Nisqually Valley between the Elbe Hills on the north and Storm King Mountain to the south. This location would be ideal for a sasquatch to be able to cross from one side of the valley to the other with minimal exposure to possible observation by humans.  The place where the creature crossed the road is a two-lane highway with very wide grassy shoulders.  The distance from the trees on one side to the trees on the other side is approximately 120 feet.  The witness was lucky in that the creature crossed the road near two lit street lights, which gave him a good view of the creature. The light enabled him to accurately judge the color of the creature being light brown, which can be difficult at night.  The wide shoulder of the road provided more time to get stopped and have the headlights pointing towards the creature, as it vanished into the woods.  The witness noticed a particular fir tree limb that the creature brushed aside as it entered the trees, and this provided a good opportunity to go back later and measure the height of the creature, which turned out to be approximately 10 feet.  The witness also got a very good look at the side of the creature's head and could clearly see the ear, as stated in his report.This is the location where the creature crossed the road.I find this witness and report to be credible in all respects. I believe this witness actually saw a large, male bigfoot creature. ",
