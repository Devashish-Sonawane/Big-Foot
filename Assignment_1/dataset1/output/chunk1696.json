            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness said it was hard to notice the creature until it moved its head in there direction. Once it moved they became frightened and quickly left the area.    Follow up Field Investigation by B.C. of Ohio.The witness and I set up a day for an on the site interview. The father agreed to join us and we walked to the site on Saturday, January 3rd, 2004. He was more aware of where the location was and led the whole way. About a mile from our car we came to the area and I took several pictures. The father related that they were all fishing and wading deer creek on a hot summer afternoon. He left the water and walked into the woods, probably to relieve himself. He noticed a very foul odor which he described as rotting flesh in the sun, only worst. He saw a crane fly over the creek but it did not land, then out of the corner of his eye he saw something big in the creek. It was watching the boys who were fishing upstream. Its height was estimated to be extremely tall-10-12 feet and extremely bulky-800-900 pounds-it was hairy all over except for face which seemed dark. It was on two feet and appeared like a giant man figure. The father moved to get back to the boys and it turned and looked at him, its head was enormous-he went back to the boys about 50 yards upstream and told them-its a f------ Bigfoot lets get out of here. The boys then saw it and they all climbed the steep bank of the creek and started back to their car a half mile away or so. The father told the boys not to run as animals can sense fear. At one point they turned around to look and it had stepped up onto the high bank and was watching them as they walked away. The father described color as brown with gray tips and the hair was moving in the breeze. The cousin to this day will not talk about the incident. Both (edited) and his dad were happy to discuss this with someone who did not belittle them. It was not an easy walk to this site, I will forward photos when I get film developed. One more thing its face was described as more human than apelike. Photo of the sighting location-",

            "Observed": "My wife and I were night fishing off the docks of chaonia landing at lake wappapello in late fall early winter 2007. At around midnight we heard rocks being thrown into the lake from across the bank.  we went to the end of the dock to see what was going on. coming down the bank along the waters edge rocks were being thrown into the water about every 50 feet or so, big rock the size of bowling balls. the bank I'm speaking of is actually an island with water on three sides of it for about 5-6 miles, and it ends right in front of the boat docks we were fishing. coming straight towards us along the bank something was throwing these boulders into the water, when out of the trees came a rock straight at us and landed in the water 6 feet in front of us followed by a very deep growl and grunt.  the distance from the end of the dock and the opposite bank is maybe 50 feet. we stood there looking into the trees desperately trying to see whatever was growling at us yet it stayed just inside the tree line.  the lights from the docks light up the whole opposite bank from point to point.  up and down the bank this creature went tossing rocks and growling and screaming.  then we noticed another creature on our side of the bank coming down towards us throwing rocks into the water howling after each rock hit the water.  the two were doing this in unison up and down the bank for over an hour while we were trapped on the dock in fear.  the one caught on the island worked his way into a huge angry fit. the two seemed to be letting the other one know where the other was.  there is so much we witnessed, heard saw that i cant possibly write all down here. for nearly two hours we stood terrified as we realized what we were experiencing. we have not really told our story to any other than family. its too unbelievable.",

Being avid fishing and outdoor enthusiasts, this couple really didn't expect or realize what they were experiencing at the time of this incident. From the time it started to the time they managed to build-up the courage to leave, was approximately 45 minutes. It seemed to the witnesses that the animal on the mainland bank was possibly the dominant animal and the one on the island was the subservient of the two. The witnesses recalled that these two animals were not happy about being separated and kept expressing their annoyance until after the couple returned to the cabin area. They didn't see eye-shine or the animals making all the noise but could tell where the vocalizations were coming from and saw the rocks as they were thrown.The witnesses have not been back to that spot  since. But I hope to meet with them there at the location soon.",
