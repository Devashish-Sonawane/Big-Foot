            "Follow-Up Report": "Milton stated this happened very quickly. He estimates he saw the animal for 3-6 seconds. He thought at first it was a tree on the immediate side of the road until it turned and took a few steps, disappearing into woods that were 15 \u0096 20 feet from the road. The creature never looked in his direction. Milton described the creature as being huge and stocky with long, dark, matted, \u0093nasty\u0094 hair that walked like a man. He said the creature\u0092s height was approximately 7 feet at least. I was not able to find Hwy 463 on Mapquest. However, he stated in his original submission as well as on the phone that he couldn\u0092t recall the exact name of the road. After looking up directions on MQ, it is possible he was traveling on US 62 based on available roads in that area that would easily lead him to his destination, however I realize this is  supposition on my part.

            "Observed": "The last two nights I have had interactions with what I think might be Bigfoots.  I live out in the country and have over the last few weeks been wood knocking in my backyard.  Last night at about 9:30pm I smacked the tree 5 times and immediately got a strange high pitched chatter to my left (south by southwest) and then another grumbling sound about 100 yards to the left of the first sound. My step-son also heard this with me and pointed in the same direction to the sounds which only lasted for a minute.  We did some more wood knocking but never heard anymore. I awoke at around 4:00am to go to the bathroom (window was open) and was barely awake when I heard a distinct 4 knocks from across the pond (my backyard faces a pond) where there is no one living closer than a half mile from that area.  It woke me up immediately and made the hair stand up on my neck. My dog growled and barked when she heard the knocking and growled for several minutes.  When she stopped I went back to bed.  Tonight (9/20) 12:30am I took our other dog out for the night to relive herself and walked over to the tree and picked up the log and smacked it 5 times. I started making guttural sounds and got an immediate response making the same sounds back at me.  There was also another sound with it like the night before which was high pitched chattering.  This repeated for about a minute when I realized I had no witnesses and went into the house to get my wife.  When we came back outside the only sound we got was of a tree branch breaking, and it was loud and distinctive.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I arrived at the witness' home about twelve hours after he made his report and found the entire family to be credible. After searching the area with the family, we were able to add the following to his original report:   1)  We found a 5\" diameter tree that was snapped          off about 5ft up.   2) There was a large, fresh path which ended         with scuffed footprints, running through a bean        field.               3) A large degraded footprint was found in mud near        the railroad tracks.   4) A large, dark, bipedal creature crossed the double        railroad tracks in four steps, about 400 yards away,        as we drove across the tracks around 6:30pm.  The        creature was very large, dark brown/black in color and          crossed a double track bed in 4 steps. This was        the area we had just driven out of.I spoke with the wife's brother the next day. He told me that as a teenager he found sets of large footprints on two separate occasions in this same area.  It appears that these magnificent animals may have frequented this area for a number of years. UPDATE:I originally thought that our initial activity had moved the animals out of the area and that they would probably return at some later date. I was wrong! They apparently returned rather quickly to the area to resume visitations. There has been almost constant activity. The following highlights are just a few:9/23/08Two of the family members checked across the pond again and found unidentified scat, an unusual strong foul odor, and footprints with a stride of about 7 feet. 10/15/08October, almost every night 1-2am the family was awakened by loud knocking sounds to the west of the house.12/27/08At about 1:15am the family was on the back porch investigating the strange behavior of the dogs. From 5 different locations they heard animals making a whooping noise. The whoops were as close as 150ft to the south of the house. They had never heard this sound before and weren't sure what it was. This is a common sound often heard in association with wood knocks.    1/4/09 (6:30pm)The boys were outside north of the house and heard tree knocking coming from the treeline about 200ft away. There was also a strong skunk-like smell in the air which dissipated quickly. At the same time, the geese on the pond were agitated and rapidly swimming to the north. As the witnesses looked to watch the geese they spotted distinct red eye-shine lingering directly across the pond.2/17/09 (6:40pm)The father and oldest son went onto the back porch to again investigate the strange behavior of the dogs. The father saw a pair of red eyes peeking out from behind a tree about 40ft away behind a fence. He was able to see the form of a large bipedal animal just before it fled. As this was happening, the son was watching a large figure walking along the pond dam. The figure crouched down at a distance of about 125ft and stayed motionless long enough to convince the son he was watching a tree stump. There are no trees or stumps on the dam.",
