Seconds later we all heard a loud aggressive, violent, bellowing and deep throated sound that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up and made others run for their guns and others their trucks.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness for about 45 minutes on 5/9/06.  During our conversation he corrected the location being west rather than north of Knoll Lake.  He explained that after he submitted the report he discussed the incident with others on this trip and they all agreed on the camp location being west of the lake and the sounds came from the southeast.He emphasized that although similar to sound bites on this website, this vocalization was more violent and harsh, and unlike any other animal call he has ever heard.  He was impressed that the calls were heard over their music and he wondered how long they actually went on before being heard.Each vocalization lasted about 5 to 10 seconds with several minutes between.  The sound had an echo quality to it leading them to believe the calls came from a nearby canyon.  About 15 minutes after the last vocalization coyotes sounded of from several directions.The campers were quiet and a bit shaken after this incident. No more sounds like this were heard during the remainder of their trip.",

There is a house way back in the woods but no one really lives there and they are only there a few weeks out of the year. I cannot see the house from mine. There are maple, oak, pine, and ash trees.

            "Observed": "We moved to this location two years ago.  We only lived here a few weeks and my four year old came running into the house and said he didn't want to play outside anymore.  He seemed upset but not extremly frightened. When I asked him what was wrong he said he saw a monkey man looking at him through the trees.  I went out and nothing was there.  I looked around the area but didn't see anything.  My son took me to the tree and showed me where someone or something was looking at him from between a fork in the tree. That was two years ago.  Yesterday my oldest son aged 15 was standing in the living room and glanced out the picture window. He said something huge and black ran from some trees we have there to beside the garage.  I was kidding and said, \"Is it bigfoot?\" And he said very seriously, \"yeah, I think it was.\"  I ran out the back door which is toward the opposite side of the garage than where whatever it was would be standing.  I ran behind the garage and to the other side but nothing was there.  I live near a heavily wooded area and the woods are close to the house behind and to one side of it.  The garage blocks the veiw of the yard and you can only see the front/side from the window. Whatever it was would have had plenty of time to run into the woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": " I performed a site visit to this area on August 7th and 12th, and spoke to both witnesses'. The following can be added to these reports.  Both witnesses\u0092 describe the animal as being six and a half to seven feet tall. The first witness describes the animal as muscular, as his sighting happened at around three in the afternoon.  The second witness again was unable to describe the animal\u0092s build because his sighting took place at ten thirty at night.  Both witnesses' describe the animal to have a pale face and hands.  Both also describe the head shape as round, with witness one stating that it did have facial hair.  The second witness states that the animal did not have a neck, while the first did not notice it.  Witness one describes the animal\u0092s arms as long with lard hands that were facing rearwards.  Witness one observed the animals from a bay window on the side of the house that was approximately fifty feet from the animal.  The second witness saw the animal from approximately one hundred feet away, and saw the animal near the wood line.  The second witness did state that as the animal was leaving he did hear one wood knock as it was heading further into the forest.  The first incident lasted only about thirty seconds in duration.  The second lasted about two minutes as the witness was trying to figure out what he was seeing.  Both describe the animal as only moving on two feet.  Both state that the animal headed into the wood line to the East.  The second witness was unaware of what had transpired the previous day when his sighting occurred.  Further examination of the area provided the following information.  The area runs along an interstate highway.  The woods behind the house open into a large field followed by more woods.  Further back another field opens up and then again woods are present.  Eventually this leads to a house.  There is a drainage area to the south of the house that leads to a creek that crosses under the highway.  Signs of movement were abundant in the woods with deer and raccoon prints being seen often.  A deer carcass was observed near the road, as was a possum near the south wood line.  No other footprints were found.  The household also throws their peelings and spoiled food out into the wood line that attracts animals.  The cat still has not shown up at the residence.  Farms and a horse barn are nearby as was the abundance of wild berries.  LaDue reservoir is located to the southeast.  ",
