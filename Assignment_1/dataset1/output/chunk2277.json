The noises heard on the first morning were about 40 yards into the thick forest, and sounded like an entire football team breaking through the brush. Several extremely loud screams were heard. They were louder and more powerful than any animal the witness has ever heard leaving him with what he called a primal fear.  On the second day, both the witness and his father viewed the creature at about 100 yards for over 20 seconds. When the animal stood up, it appeared to be at least seven feet tall, covered with shaggy reddish hair, and had the physique of a body builder. As it walked off and turned to look back, the witness said it looked exactly like the bipedal animal in the Patterson-Gimlin film.",
