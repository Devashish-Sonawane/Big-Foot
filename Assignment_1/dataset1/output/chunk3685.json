            "Follow-Up Report": "On 10-3-05, I spoke briefly with the witness who filed the report and then more extensively with the witness\u0092 husband who also witnessed the sighting.  The couple has since moved from the area to another state.  Both individuals were articulate and recounted the incidence with good detail.  The couple was returning to their home from a late-night movie around 12:30 AM.  As the car moved through a right curve in the road, a bipedal figure emerged from the left-hand side of the road approximately 25 yards in front of the car.  The animal traversed the road in 4 quick strides, moving in a slightly hunched position with the arms at its side.  The \u0091gorilla-like\u0092 creature was described as being relatively short with a very broad back and arms that appeared longer than human arms.  The weight was estimated at approximately 250-300 lbs.  The sighting lasted 4-5 seconds.  The couple slowed the car down to approximately 15 mph as they passed the point where the animal entered the bushes and looked, but did not see the figure or any movement. The animal appeared to be headed in a westerly direction toward Rt. 130.   The sighting occurred in the extreme northeastern part of Burlington County, about \u00bd mile from the Mercer County border.  Crosswicks Creek is located nearby which forms the Burlington-Mercer County border and flows in a westerly direction into the Delaware River located approximately 5 miles away.   To the southeast of the sighting is a large contiguous tract of undeveloped land that eventually joins with the Fort Dix Military Reservation approximately 15 miles away.  Fort Dix is located in the northernmost part of a region known as the Pinelands or Pine Barrens, which is the largest tract of open land on the entire Mid-Atlantic Coast. The Pine Barrens has abundant small game and wildlife, and consists of forests of pine, oak and cedar with abundant shallow aquifers that feed area hardwoods, swamps, bogs and marshes. Adjacent to Fort Dix to the southeast is Lebanon State Forest where an incident has been previously reported (Report 1429).  ",
