            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with both the woman who reported the incident and her husband, the witness, who is very credible. He saw something in a secluded part of this hunting area that fit the description of a white furred bigfoot. Sightings of white furred bigfoots are relatively rare, but not restricted to any one part of the country.He described it as a tall, upright walking man-shaped animal covered with white fur. He is sure it was not a human because of the way it moved. The witness thought it ran because it was spooked by the noise his son was making as they walked down the trail.This location is only a mile or two from the Des Moines River. It tends to corroborate what has been said about Iowa sightings for many years -- most happen within a few miles of the Des Moines River. The last Iowa sighting involved what appeared to be a dark furred bigfoot, along the Des Moines River near the city of Des Moines. Pella is about 50 miles from Des Moines.The witness in this case will return to the scene of his incident in a few days. I explained to him what to look for and what to do while he's there. He'll let me know if he finds anything, etc.",
