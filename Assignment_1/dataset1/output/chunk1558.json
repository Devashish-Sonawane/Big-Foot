There was a smell of rancid decay in the area for about 2 days...we could not find the source of the smell. I have read about people smelling them but I don't know what they smell like. The smell that I detected was identical to a dead animal that was in the process of severe decay.",

I was working the graveyard (11pm-7am) shift on top of the mountain at a strip mine that was closing. The company was in the process of moving all of the expensive equipment to another site. I had a little trailer as an office and several large pieces of equipment and machinery surrounded the trailer. The location was sort of in a sinkhole that had been created at the top of this mountain..due to blasting.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a 40 year old male, professional, raised not far from the sighting location. He stated the creature climbed up a steep bank into thick cover in two or three steps. The animal moved faster than he had ever seen a human move. It was bent at the waist at around a 30 degree angle while moving away and seemed to be over 6 feet tall. In the days prior to the sighting, he had heard single Ohio Scream-type  calls near the mine. He was sure the sound was not made by an owl or mountin lion. He described other noises as similar to that of a hand cranked air raid siren.Investigation of the trackway the following day did not produce any distinct footprints. He felt the creature was heading to a trash dumpster where many other animals had also been seen.",
