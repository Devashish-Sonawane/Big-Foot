It was midafternoon when I heard a sound in the woods behind our home that reminded of sounds that bigfoot researchers make on television shows when they are calling to see a bigfoot is in the area.  It really gave me goosebumps.  Last night around dusk I heard a screech from the opposite direction. Again, it was different than anything I have ever heard.",

Both vocalizations seemed to last for about five seconds.  They came from approximately 300-400 yards away from his home but seemed very close and loud.  I sent him to various sites to find out what the vocalizations sounded like.  He reported back that he thought the sound was similar to the 1978 Whoop-Howl Snohomish County, Washington.",
