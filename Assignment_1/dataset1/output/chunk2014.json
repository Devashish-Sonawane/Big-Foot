            "Follow-Up Report": "I was able to meet with the witnesses involved with these encounters in late December 2013.  During my interview with two of the three witnesses \u0096 a daughter and her father, several interesting details emerged regarding their encounters.  The activity probably occurred over a ten day period leading up to the three distinct sightings. Living on a small farm, the witnesses have horses, donkeys, and chickens.  These animals are kept in an L-shaped coral area that extends from the front of the property, along the side of the yard and around the back adjacent to a small creek.  The coral is fence enclosed with the fence being five feet high in the front, and four feet high at the back of the property.  A separate strand of wire in the front of the fence has a low electric current, designed to keep the horses and donkeys from getting too close to it.About a week before the three sightings, the witnesses started seeing their chickens disappearing from the coral area.  What was very unusual, was the fact that whatever was taking the chickens was also ripping each of their wings and discarding them near the small, open chicken coup in the center of the corral at the back of the farm.   (The chickens were not caged or locked-up, but stayed near the coup for food and shelter.) At first, the witnesses thought that a fox or foxes were taking their chickens, but what was extremely unusual was that so many chickens were being taken in such a short period of time and that the wings were being ripped off each bird, and discarded near the chicken coup.A few days after the chickens had disappeared, the first witness (the daughter) was visiting her parents and was getting ready to depart around 3 am, just after her father got home from work.  When she stepped outside and started walking toward her car, she heard the neighbor\u0092s two German shepherd dogs barking widely. The German shepherds bark when people walk by, but usually stop after a few seconds.  When the witness looked over toward the neighbor\u0092s house to see why the dogs were still barking, she saw a large, dark silhouette moving quickly from north to south, along South Clayton Road just on the other side of the neighbor\u0092s fence. The neighbor\u0092s fence is approximately four feet high, and the dark silhouette was considerably taller than the fence and moving very quickly leading the witness to believe that one of their horses had gotten out of the corral, and was running along South Clayton Road after being spooked by the neighbor\u0092s German shepherds. When the object approached a street light, the witness noticed that it was not a horse, because it was running upright, on two legs like a human being \u0096 but was much larger, and moving incredibly fast. What was also unusual was the object appeared to have a very large head and shoulders, long arms, and no visible neck. When the witness\u0092 Great Dane puppy started to bark, she grabbed him and ran frantically into the house. She proceeded to tell her mother and father what had just happened and thought that she had seen a \u0093Bigfoot.\u0094  After seeing how upset and frightened his daughter was, her father grabbed his guns and took his daughter outside to see where she had seen the Bigfoot.The daughter then went back inside while her father stayed outside waiting to see if the Bigfoot would reappear.  After being outside a few minutes, the neighbor\u0092s two German shepherds started barking again.  The father looked over toward the neighbor\u0092s house where the two dogs were barking and saw a large, dark silhouette walking south, along South Clayton Road in the same location where his daughter had seen a Bigfoot earlier.  The father watched the Bigfoot continue south eventually crossing Mile Road, near the Mile Road \u0096 South Clayton Road intersection before entering, and then disappearing in the adjacent cornfield.  Not wanting to scare his daughter or his wife, the father did not mention his sighting.  About 45 minutes later, the father and mother walked their daughter out to the car and she departed for home.A few days later, the farther, mother and daughter all sat down and talked about the two Bigfoot sightings they had witnesses just a few days before.  During their conversation, the mother mentioned that she had seen a large, dark figure walking along the back of the property along their fence line moving east to west, adjacent to the wood line and small stream on the back edge of their property.  The mother observed the Bigfoot for a few minutes before it disappeared into the wood line near the neighbor\u0092s property. She did not mention it to her husband or daughter right away, because she was not sure what it was that she had actually seen.Investigator Comments:  After conducting a follow-up investigation with the witnesses \u0096 I sincerely believe that they are all very credible and did have three distinct Sasquatch encounters.  Their family farm is located south of New Lebanon, adjacent to many cornfields, wooded areas, and small streams. There are large numbers of deer and other game throughout the area, not to mention farm poultry that could easily provide ample food stuffs for a clan of Sasquatch.  Finally, there have been a large number of reported Sasquatch encounters in the vicinity of the New Lebanon area during the past ten years.  I am currently attempting to conduct follow-up investigations on the two other reported Sasquatch encounters that occurred a few miles south of this farm near Germantown and Miamisburg, Ohio. ",
