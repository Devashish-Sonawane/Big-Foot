            "Observed": "My son has convinced me to contact you. I will tell your organization of our encounters. On November 28 2008 I was visiting a friends house in Lacey's Spring Alabama. His house is in a small middle class  neighborhood with mountains and woods that stretch for miles behind his home. I woke up to use the bathroom at about 4:00AM and had just laid back down when I began to hear loud vocalizations. The sounds where very similar to the Ohio and Mississippi recordings. I was inside the house and his heating unit was running so they must have been very loud outside. I got up and went out on his back deck but by the time I got there they had stopped. I listened for about 10 minutes and heard nothing. The heating unit was next to the deck and was quite loud so I decided to go back inside. About the time I started",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke to witness about attempting to record the sounds.Witness said only difference between the Ohio Howl and what he heard is that the howls he heard did not go as long. The area where the howls were heard is very close to vast forest and the Tennessee River. It is not too far from Redstone Arsenal, which usually means no people in a large area. Witness did not go out and look around in daylight because he had to leave early to return home.Witness also had a story of a sighting in the 70's when he was about 10 years old. Sighting took place in Fayetville ,NY, in Madison County. He was walking up a gravel road when something was heard coming up through the woods. Witness assumed it was the neighbor's two dogs who frequently roamed the area and would run up to him when he was around. He called the dogs names and the sounds stopped. He could see something black through the trees and bushes less then 100 ft from him. He could define arms that were very long when it turned. The movement was coming from very high up, about 7-8 feet off the ground. He was very alarmed, frozen in fear he managed to move forward a bit and the creature seemed to move around the tree as he moved like it did not want to be seen. He saw no facial features due to the brush. It suddenly moved away from him in the opposite direction and disappeared. Again the movement he saw was 7-8 feet off the ground always while in sight of the creature. He could hear the creature moving through the brush but the movement was not as loud as the witness thought it should be due to the creature's large size.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone on 21 August. He was articulate and well spoken. He recounted his experience of the unusual scream. He said it so startled him that when he jumped up from his recliner, he pulled his Achille's tendon. It rained during the night and the following morning.The next day he went across the street to his neighbor's house where he felt the sound originated.  They were not home but he found a possible print that he sent to my phone:As his yard is very dry and hard, this area was of softer earth. His shoe size is a size 11 and the potential print was longer than his shoe though he felt it was narrow in the middle except in the heel area which was wide. He no longer talks about the incident as he was teased when he tried to discuss it. He searched the Internet for animal sounds and eliminated owls, bobcat, and coyotes. He found the BFRO site during his search and one of the howls sounded exactly like what he heard.Their have been two additional reports in the area of Pickett's Mill Battlefield Park. This is a protected area in NW Cobb County. The area has had tremendous growth in the last 20 years as a major suburb of Atlanta. The area still supports a large deer population as well as bear and other small mammals. There are several protected WMA's and corridors that interconnect these areas as you move away from the city. The area is mixed pine and hardwood and has had substantial development due to rapid growth of the Atlanta suburbs.",
