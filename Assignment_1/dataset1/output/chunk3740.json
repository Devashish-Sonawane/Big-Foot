IT WAS 4TH OF JULY EVENING JUST AFTER DUSK. I WAS WITH MY 10 YEAR OLD BROTHER, AND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GOING TO THE NORTH END OF THE ISLAND TO OBSERVE THE FIRE WORKS DISPLAY. HOW EVER I REALLY JUST WANTED TO DO ALLOT OF DRIVING AROUND. I HAD TURNED OFF THE MAIN ROAD, ONE WHICH CIRCLED THE PERIMETER OF THE ISLAND, ON TO A DIRT ROAD. IT WAS RATHER NARROW AND WINDING. AS I CAME AROUND A TURN I SAW A CREATURE STEP OUT OF THE WOODS ON TO THE ROAD. IT STOPPED, AS THE LIGHTS FROM MY CAR SHOWN ON IT. IT WAS ABOUT 5 1/2 FEET TALL. IT WAS COVERED WITH LONG HAIR FROM HEAD TO TOE. THE HAIR COLOR ALMOST SEEMED GRAYISH. IT STOPPED FOR A MOMENT THEN JUST PROCEEDED TO CROSS THE ROAD AND GO INTO THE WOODS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE. NO ONE REALLY BELIEVED THE STORY, BUT MY BROTHER DOES RECALL BEING FRIGHTENED THAT EVENING, BUT NOTHING MORE. I NEVER THOUGHT TOO MUCH ABOUT IT UNTIL A SAW A SHOW ON BIG FOOT THAT MENTIONED SIGHTINGS IN THAT AREA.",

He had the following information to add to his report:The creature entered the road at an angle, allowing the witness to first see its left side and its back. It walked with a very fluid, graceful gait that the witness compared to a \"dance-like movement\". As the witness slowed his car to look at the creature, it stopped and turned its head to look at the vehicle. The creature didn't seem alarmed as it moved casually to look at the witness. Its height was approximately five and a half feet tall. Its build was described as lean; not large and bulky. The witness estimated that its weight was approximate to a human of the same size; 120 - 130 lbs. The witness immediately noticed the unusual length of its arms, much longer than human proportions. It was covered uniformly from head to toe in light gray hair, three to four inches in length.  The witness noted that its eyes reflected in the car lights with a yellow-green tint. No contrast was noticed between the coloration of the skin and the hair. The witness had the distinct impression that he was looking at a young individual. After a few brief moments, the creature resumed its course and walked quickly into the forest.",
