This is near where the Tygart Valley River swerves away from the highway and starts to descend into a long \"canyon\" between Belington  and Philippi.  It is extremely steep, there are many waterfalls, etc. and is very hard to access.",

            "Other Stories": "Since looking at your website,  I have gotten up the courage to talk to my uncle who lived near the canyon.  He has seen bear, a mountain lion, bobcats and coyotes out there.  I just asked him if he had ever seen or heard any animal out there that he could not explain.  He said he had heard strange howling sounds many times, but he knew it wasn\u0092t a bobcat.  He wondered if it was coyotes, but wasn\u0092t convinced that was what it was, either.  He did not make fun of me, but was very serious, so I did tell him what I saw.  He feels it\u0092s possible for something to be living down in that canyon, as there are abandoned coal mines they could live in and keep out of sight.  He also knows a man who lives over the hill from where I saw this thing that plants a field of corn and leaves it for the deer and other animals, and speculated the animal had found a food source, so took the chance of crossing the highway.",

About a mile out of town, I had just passed a small group of houses on the right. The highway curves to the right; there is a long guard rail on the right side of the road. As I was coming around the long curve, my headlights caught something up ahead, standing on the white line on the right side of the road.",

The details of the evening are still vivid in her description. The witness is fearful of being alone outside after dark, which is not normal for her. She had previously felt comfortable outside at night while on foot. She sighted the creature while driving westbound at 50-55 mph. At  about 6-7 car lengths from it, she passed and observed it had human like features to its face but the mouth and chin looked more like a chimpanzee/ape than human. It had its eyes closed against her cars headlights and was rock steady as she approached. The creature was broad sholdered, tall and lanky. The hair covering it was not matted and it looked well groomed. It had had a beard surrounding the face. ",
