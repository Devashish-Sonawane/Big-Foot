Upon doing so, she saw a dark figure at the edge of the lit area make its way across the property and disappear into the darkness. We have received other reports from this area that we are working on at this time. The East Fork Wilderness and Wildlife Areas are nearby.",

The creature walked smoothly and stood very erect. At first I thought it was a gorilla, then immediately realized that didn't make any sense; but it had too long arms for a bear, and didn't stand or move like one. At that time I was utterly perplexed and could find no rational explanation for what I had seen. I did not hear of Bigfoot until several years later when some photos were televised and I realized that this looked like what I had seen. I did stop the car and attempt to look across the low traffic barrier and into the woods where the being had gone, but could see no trace of it.",
