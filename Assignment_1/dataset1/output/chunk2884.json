I turned on my porch light, and called my dogs. When my dogs got to the porch, I smelt a strange odor. The air was filled with an odor of raw sewage and rotting meat. I went on out in my yard about 10 feet and looked around. Just over a fence that was about 5 yards from me, I noticed what I thought might be a bear up on two legs. I yelled for it to \"get out of here\". Then I noticed that instead of walking on all 4 legs, it walked like a human, upright. It was about 8 feet high and long, ape like arms. It had long hair on \"his\" body.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness relates further details:-The creature was behind a barbed wire fence.-When the creature ambulated away its gait was upright. \"It walked like an upright ape.\"-Later, the witness and his grandfather walked along the fence row for three hours in an attempt to find tracks or sign, but nothing was found.-The grandmother said the sound she heard was distant.  She thought it was a panther, but lower and deeper; not of the same pitch as a panther.",
