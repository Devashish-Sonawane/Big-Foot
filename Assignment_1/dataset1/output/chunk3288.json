Texture more like the latter. I assumed male but have no reason for that. Very heavily built, we were scared and felt the need to get lost from there quickly with the two little ones - but we walked fast, did not run (as one would do in the African bush where running is dangerous as it makes you look like prey.) So all we saw was the creature crossing the road. I'm sorry I can't think of any more details, I just didn't pay a lot of attention, not thinking it was unusual at the time - just assumed it was a giant bear. He (or she?) hesitated as he walked out of the dense undergrowth on the right with left arm bent so hand would be in front of sternum, I did not see anything carried. He looked startled/surprised on seeing us and then quickly crossed the road - so the noise through the brush was urgent and unabashed, whereas he'd arrived without a lot of noise.",
