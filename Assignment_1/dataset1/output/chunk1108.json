            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness was interviewed for nearly 90 minutes in early December, 2007. His original report did not actually render his encounter, but only made reference to an incident. It was in the interview that the following account came to light.The witness was a teen at the time of the incident in the fall of 1977 when he lived on the edge of a great wooded area near (200 yds) a canal that ran into the everglades, about 5 miles away. He had awakened just before sunrise and was on his way to the bathroom when he looked out his open, screened window and saw what looked like a shadow of a head. To see if it was real or a shadow, (he doubted it was real, since the window was 6\u0092-7\u0092 off the ground) he grunted toward the window and got 2 quick, forceful return grunts that made the screen visibly vibrate and he saw vapor come through the screen. He quickly ran calling to his dad and they immediately went outside where they saw the creature walking near the woods on their property. It stopped as they saw it, seeing them simultaneously. It turned and faced them and he described its upper torso as \u0093gigantic, like two people side by side\u0094.  At that time, it turned and looked towards the woods, and proceeded to run into the woods. His dad had a gun, but did not shoot. There were 2 pines on the edge of their property that were 4\u0094 to 6\u0094 in diameter that it bent and broke in its exit. The next day his dad picked him up from school and when they came home, their neighbor was outside his house with his gun and bird dogs and said, \u0093I saw Bigfoot! I\u0092m going to kill him!\u0094 The following information about the creature was gleaned during the interview;\u0095The creature was about 8\u0092-9\u0092 tall, \u0093\u0085way bigger than Shaquille O\u0092Neal\u0094 and towered over his own 6\u00922 frame at the time.\u0095He estimated hits weight at well over 600 lbs.\u0095The shoulder width was estimated at approaching 4\u0092.\u0095He described the hair as jet black, about 2\u0094 long, and said it glistened in the sun, almost appearing iridescent. The hair was straight and appeared almost groomed. The hair was described as like that of an ape rather than human like.\u0095The eyes were described as very dark, either black or brown. \u0095The creature had a distinct brow ridge.\u0095The face was described as more human-like than ape-like, with no distinctly protruding snout.\u0095The witness stated that ears were very small if they were even visualized. \u0095The witness stated that there was no visible neck; that the musculature from the sides of the head seemed to blend directly into the shoulders.\u0095He stated that the arm length was such that the hand appeared several inches below the knees.\u0095He identified the hands as being huge, \u0093twice as big as mine\u0094. In addition, he stated that the upper arm was extremely muscular and lower arm as being more human-like.\u0095The legs were described as \u0093like the Jacobs photo; long and muscular, \u0093ripped\u0094 with no fat, and long and slender. He stated that the thighs were heavily muscled, 2-2.5 times bigger than a man\u0092s. He described the calves as slender.\u0095He could not describe the feet, but stated that the ground was hard limestone based and showed no prints, which they looked for.\u0095No odor was described.\u0095He stated that the creature ran in its exit and described a \u0093very long stride\u0094. This witness was found to be entirely credible. It is the opinion of this investigator that this account is a record of an actual experience.",
