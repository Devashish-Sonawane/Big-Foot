            "Other Stories": "I can't believe i didn't relate these events. About a year prior, my cousin and I were camping at my parents house (on the same river, downstream from above incident). Around 11, above the wind we could hear branches and twigs breaking. We brushed it off, then came a small ker-sploosh in the river. Five minutes later came another ker-sploosh. My cousin (12) got scared and I was trying to be brave. I knew i was being watched, beacuse I was trying to act normal, but was very scared. We stayed up and talked to try and dissipate the fear, I guess. about 45 minutes later, as we were dozing off, a loud CRASH and a THUMP! like a tree full of leaves falling to the ground. We were a half mile from my parent's house. We both bolted, full of fear. My cousin had no shoes on, I raced to put mine on, and we ran in the complete dark. (It was a cloudy and slighty breezy night, but really warm, early summer 1994 or so). I couldnt see my hand in front of me and yelled at my cousin to stop. We were both so scared, and when we got to the house, we couldn't talk or even think of sleeping. The house is full of large windows and we couldnt take our eyes off the floor. I KNEW something was watching us. My dad yelled at me a few days later for not cleaning up our campsite, but there was no way I was going down there.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "In two phone interviews with the witness I learned more about the sighting he briefly describes in his report. It was quite an extraordinary encounter for him, that became clear as I listened to him tell his story.As the witness suggests, the sighting really frightened him. He told me that as he approached the creature, which was just off the road walking parallel to it, it became increasingly clear that it wasn\u0092t a man, and then that it definitely wasn\u0092t, that it was a huge hair-covered creature, and he started screaming. But neither his car rolling past \u0096 closely past \u0096 nor his screaming seemed to bother the creature. It showed no reaction to him passing by at all.The witness\u0092s description of the creature:\u0095 It was \u0093huge.\u0094 He used that word several times in telling me about it.\u0095 The color was interesting, seemingly very light \u0096 gray/silver/white \u0096 and he got the impression the hair color was somewhat darker closer to its body. He thought the cowlick he mentions might have revealed that, because roots of the hair showed somewhat there.\u0095 The cowlick was striking to him. It was at the top of the creature\u0092s back at the base of its neck. Otherwise the animal was \u0093sleek,\u0094 he said. The hair was not more than two or three inches long and lay close to the body so he could see its muscles and strong build well. The color did not vary over the creature's body and it was entirely (his view was only of the animal\u0092s back side) covered in hair.\u0095 The shoulders were very large and the waist was narrow; \u0093Its upper body was like a triangle,\u0094 the witness said. And when I asked if it looked healthy he said, \u0093Oh yeah.\u0094 \u0095 When I asked the witness to speculate on the animal\u0092s gender, he said he\u0092d guess male, and thought it seemed masculine.\u0095 He described the head, which he saw only from behind, as being set quite low and forward on the shoulders. It didn\u0092t have much of a neck, he said. And he didn\u0092t think the head had any kind of a point at the top (he\u0092d recently read some other BFRO report indicating pointed heads).The witness, a man in his middle twenties, (and in his middle teens at the time \u0096 he\u0092d recently gotten his drivers license), was very believable to me. His reaction to seeing such a creature \u0096 in the dark, by himself \u0096 was to freak out. He said he pulled over shortly after the sighting and just roared from the jarring anxiety the experience caused him. And then he told no one about it. He couldn\u0092t quite articulate why for me, but for some reason he just put the experience aside and didn\u0092t think much about it until recently, when he stumbled onto the BFRO web site.When I asked if he was certain about it, he said he absolutely was; he saw that huge, nearly white creature and he\u0092s sure it was a real animal \u0096 it was not someone in a suit. \u0093It looked like a great big monkey,\u0094 he told me.It\u0092s interesting to note that in 2000, and also in the spring, a big \u0093gray\u0094 creature was seen near Granton, Wisconsin, which is about 100 miles east of where this sighting occurred. In 1972 near Willow River, Minnesota (about 100 miles north of this sighting), two white creatures were seen.",
