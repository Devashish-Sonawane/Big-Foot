            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witnesses by phone:The witness is retired and cannot remember exact date they went on this drive. As stated, they had to stop at a bridge over the creek. It is heavily forested as seen on the satellite view below. Due to pandemic lockdowns, they did not see another vehicle on this road.   The girlfriend did not see a figure but heard walking, crunching, two branch breaks about 100 feet away. While the boyfriend was dropping string and cup over the bridge, two rocks landed four to five feet away from him. Each rock was just a little larger than a marble. He saw the second rock roll by him. Then the softball sized rock hit a large boulder that was thirty to forty feet away, in the water but near the edge of the creek. The rock shattered and the pieces landed in the water. No foul odor was detected. The witness is not sure what fish may be in this creek but has seen crawdads in it. He believes, and I agree, that a Bigfoot thought he was fishing because he had a string hanging over the bridge. He believes a Bigfoot wanted them away from that part of the creek and the thrown rocks were a warning.  I find him credible. He was thinking about Bigfoot behavior.  ",

I looked up and saw something moving away from the entrance to my garage (my main door was open). I could see in the lights from inside my garage that it was at least as tall as I (6'+) and was a brownish color. I shined my light at it. It moved purposefully but not hurried, quickly but not in fear. It was upright but I don't recall seeing legs, although my light was at the upper portion of it.",
