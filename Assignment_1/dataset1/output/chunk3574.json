It was like a large human-like footprint that headed towards the road that led to the weir.  We looked for more and located some more that crossed the road towards the Little Manistee River.  In this area, there had been some unsusal sightings and sounds by many fly fisherman, namely seeing large black objects watching them then moving away, generally interpreted as black bear.  Not unlikely, but not on two feet.  Well, that  was around 1983-84.  In 1985, I was working with a guy at the Filer City Mill of Packaging Corporation of America who confirmed a similar sighting near that area.",

I saw his flashlight bobbin in the woods to my right (south) as I headed to my blind. He got into position, kicked up something that smelled awful.  This thing was crashing through the woods like a freight train.  It was too loud to be a deer,as it crashed right by me in the dark, smelling awful. i didn't know what it was, but was frightened sitting there in the dark until it got light out.",
