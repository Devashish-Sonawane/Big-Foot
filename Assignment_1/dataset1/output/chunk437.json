            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness for about an hour. I have been near this location before, and driven the same road off the highway, although not to exactly this place. I am familiar with the area.  From the description of how they got to the location, and by talking to the witness I was able to resolve the exact location.  The significant events are that they were followed after walking in about a half mile. They were followed for another quarter mile to the place where they stopped. Then, the witness stepped off the road to try to look down the embankment to the river below, and this is when the creature growled powerfully at him.  He could feel the growl as well as hear it. Later, after waiting until dark for the other hunters, they decided to walk out. The creature again followed them and made no effort to be stealthy. It sounded like a person walking along in the woods next to them about 20 yards away. It followed them the full distance back to their truck, only leaving them as they came within sight of the vehicle. Considering the context of the situation, and that it is extremely unlikely that a deer, elk, or bear would follow them at all, let alone for such an extended distance, I feel that this was an encounter with a sasquatch. The behavior is consistent with what I and other investigators have experienced first-hand on expeditions where we have also observed the sasquatch through night vision, or thermal imagers.  ",

I had just gotten home and walked up to my front door and was about to push my key into the lock when I heard, what I can only describe as, a \u0093hooting\u0094 noise like \u0093Hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot\u0094 in rapid succession. I paused and turned around slowly and walked to the edge of my doorstep listening closer and it happened a second time \u0093Hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot.\u0094 Following the second vocalization, all of the dogs in town began barking and howling incessantly. The noises did not sound very close, but it was extremely loud and sounded like it carried over from the mountain just south of town.",
