            "Observed": "I was coming home from a school function around 9:00 in the evening on a thursday, down (edited) street.  Shortly after passing (edited) the car in front of me began to slow down, and I thought they were going to turn, but they did not signal.  They then came to a complete stop and I was slowly coming up behind them.  Something then crossed the road.  At first I thought it was deer, not giving it much thought, but then I realized it was probably a good four feet taller than the mid-size car in front of me.  Another one followed not too far behind the first.  They were very large, barrel chested, like a gorrilla walking like a human.  They sort of marched, lifting their knees higher than a person would when they walked.  They did not seem at all frightened by the running cars with bright lights, they didn't even look towards the cars.  I couldn't see their color or texture because of the darkness, and they were definitely not human.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "     I spoke with this witness at length.  He is a young man, 17.  After this experience he went home and told his parents and admits he isn't sure if they thought he was \"crazy\" or not.  He was, as he noted in his report, quite shaken.  However, rather than blowing him off, his Dad did a search on the web and found the BFRO, and he encouraged his son to file a report.  This particular area of the State is not known to me as having had any prior activity, and the area of the sighting is relatively populated - but with many forests and farms nearby.  I feel this witness is very credible for a number of reasons.  He and I would both like to speak with the people in the car ahead of his.  (I can be reached through the \"comments\" link at bfro.net., or, a formal report can be filed.)  This witness has my contact information and we will remain in touch.",

I was about 15 and my friend & I went hiking in the hills between these two neighboring towns of Sutherlin & Oakland, Oregon.  It was in the fall, I believe we were just about to go back to school for the year.  It was a pretty warm day.  We stopped along the way to take a restroom break.  We were on some logging roads, or they may have just been fire control roads put there by the BLM, but anyway we were on a curve in the road.  We knew there were probably other people in the area, and so we each posted a 'watch-out' while the other of us did our business.  Anyway, I was watching out for her, and walked a little way back down the road the way we had just come... when I heard a noise.",
