            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and she remembers that night well. It was a short distance from her rural home, about 11pm. She was nervous about the walk, but her boyfriend reminded her it was a full moon and hardly pitch dark. The area is heavily wooded, with many creeks, ponds and farms. She walked in the middle of the dirt road toward her home, and as she neared an old farm shed situated just off the road, she heard a deep grunt/blow as if she startled an animal...what ever it was shifted its weight and rose in a gorilla-like stance just 20ft from her. She said she could feel the ground shake as this creature adjusted its position.  It emitted a short blow/grunt and she surmised it must have been on the ground and startled into a upright (though not standing) position. She had a perfect silhouette. She described it as huge and muscular. Covered in what must have dark colored hair, she couldn't discern any color. Its two huge arms bowed out in front of it with its knuckles on the ground. She said it appeared like a huge gorilla, with a massive head. Even at her 5' 5\" height, this thing was still taller than her and it wasn't even standing. At this point she was stopped in the middle of the road and face to face with it. She quickly moved to the furthest side of the road and grasped her cross around her neck and began to pray to herself.  She was taught at an early age NOT to run from an animal, so she began to walk quickly toward her home, and glanced over her shoulder. The figure slowly turned its head as it watched her walk. She looked straight ahead and never looked back again. ",
