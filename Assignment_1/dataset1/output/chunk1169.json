It is a tough hike but eventually you will come to the remaining foundation of the deer hunter's cabin.  It was in this vacinity where we met this large, hairy, smelly guy near the creek.

Suddenly he said his dog yelped, and turned around without waiting for him and ran back down the mountain.  This man said that he never did see anything but he felt there was someone watching him and he said he felt the hair on his neck and arms prickle.  He thought maybe it was a bear.  But the smell kept coming back to him.  This story was shared with me before I had told him my own.",

            "Observed": "In Sept. 1984 my friend and I were hiking on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Mtn. Range above Lake Tahoe and the Carson Valley above the town Genoa.  Both of us grew up in this area.  Although in high school I was kind of a cut up, my friend Linda, graduated valedictorian of our class 5 years earlier.  She is very logical.  We have often hiked this trail that basically goes straight up the mountain and over to Tahoe.  It is a strenuous hike.  When we parked our truck at the trailhead there was another car parked there as well.  We were 1/4 the way up the trail when two teenage boys came running down the mountain towards us.  The trail was extremely steep and they were running for all they were worth.  They stopped long enough to implore us not to go any further up the mountain as they had seen a monster or something.  There was an old deer hunter's cabin at about the half way point and we told the boys that we were only going to go that far.  (We thought they were drinking or on drugs) We shrugged off the incident laughed and joked that we wished we had what they were \"smoking.\"",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Following the investigator's interview with the witness, the following information can be added to this report:Just prior to the encounter, the witness reports having the \"sense of being watched.\"The witness reported the \"hairy man,\" as she called it, had possibly been nearby for some time without them noticing, as he was very close when they did notice him. The witness reported he raised his nose to the sky and was heard to take a big \"sniff,\" followed by a very loud, deep \"huff\" which much resembled a snort from a very large bull, which she was accustomed to hearing.The witness reported he then turned and ran off uphill in a very fluid and graceful, yet powerful and agile fashion.  He ran up a very steep hill covered with thick pine needles without missing a step or slipping at all.  He was reported to have run uphill in a \"hunched over\" position, but he used his hands for \"swatting objects out of the way,\" rather than for locomotion.The witness reported he followed them down the hill, staying off to the side and uphill from them.  The hike back down to their truck took approximately one hour.  Upon arriving back at the truck, the witnesses took a rest break and sat on the hood of the truck while the \"hairy man\" stayed on the ridge above them, and appeared to be observing them.  As they began to leave, the witness shouted to him, which may have caused him to rise from his crouched position and stand upright.The witness had several observations on physical features to report as well.  Working from the top down, they are as follows:\u00b7The head was very large, with a prominent brow ridge and deep-set, dark eyes.\u00b7The face was flat, with a \u0093ruddy\u0094 complexion.\u00b7The nose was flat and wide, with nothing resembling a prominent snout.\u00b7Estimated size was 7 feet tall and 360 pounds.\u00b7The shoulders and chest were very wide and very muscular, much like a very serious body builder; the hair was thinning on the chest; no breasts were visible.\u00b7The abdomen was very firm, described as \u0093six-pack\u0094 abs.\u00b7The definition of the muscles was quite visible through the hair.\u00b7The hair was of varying length, with some obvious patches \u0093worn off\u0094 on the chest, buttocks and about the lower portion of the legs.  The hair was described as \u0093human-like, not thick like a bear\u0092s coat.\u0094\u00b7The hands observed were described as \u0093huge\u0094 and hung to the knees.\u00b7The feet were described as \u0093gigantic.\u0094\u00b7The exposed skin color was described as being much the same as the color of the dirt, giving a \u0093very dirty\u0094 appearance to it.The witness reports having been in the same area many times since then, yet she has had no further encounters.The witness also submitted a sketch done shortly after her encounter that she feels fairly depicts what she saw that day.",
