I walked along a somewhat open road and not seeing any birds was on my way back to the camper. About a 100 yards or so from the camper, I heard some very heavy footsteps. Thinking it to be another hunter walking heavily to alert others that might be in the area that he was coming through the cover. I stopped on the road waiting for the person to appear so I could acknowledge his presence, and he, mine. What appeared in an opening was what I thought at first to be a bear. It was standing upright and when it came into view, it spotted me immediately, turned toward me and froze. It stood there for only a few seconds, then suddenly turned to its left and disappeared. It made absolutely no noise when it left. I later went down to where I had seen it to look for tracks. It had come up an old overgrown logging road and the ground was hard packed with tufted grass laying over. I could find no tracks and couldn't even make any myself. I was an absolute non-believer in Sasquatch and Flying Saucers and I had difficulty accepting what I had seen.",
