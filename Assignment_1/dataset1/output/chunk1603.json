            "Observed": "It was late summer at my grandfather's cattle farm. My grandfather owns XX's of acres of property in Pope County, in the city of Russelville. He lives on a small corner of his property on about XX acres of land on which he grazes his cattle. One night when were sitting on the porch of his trailer home, we noticed that something was disturbing the cattle. The \"Brem\" Cattle that were usually calm and scattered by the barn on the far side of the property, came running to the fence as they usually did when threatened by a Coy dog. Without giving it a second thought we hopped in the truck, grabbed the night vision binoculars and the high beam and started around the perimeter of the grazing land. We saw nothing until we came down near the pond where the cattle were watered. At first, we missed it with the night vision goggles because it was so still. But when we ran the light through the trees, we caught the glare from its eyes looking right at us. It was too far up in the trees to be a deer or a coy dog and the eyes were too big to be an oppossum or coon. We trained the light on its eyes and as we scanned down the tree, we saw what looked like a very large man leaning very still against the tree. He was huge, around 8 feet tall with black hair and eyes. His hair covered every inch of his body except for his face which was slightly less hairy around the eyes and forhead. I saw him first because I was using the high beam to scan the tree line and brush for eyes. I was too afraid to say anything and by the time I finally found the words to say and pointed grandpa in the right direction, the creature had turned and walked away. The next day we went to look where the creature was standing, but we found no prints because of the shale that was used to form the levy for the pond.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness in a telephone interview and he was able to add the following:*The fence was comprised of barbed wire 6' feet high.  The animal was approximately 2-3 feet taller than the top strand of wire givng the animal an estimated height of 8' to 9 ' tall.  *Estimated animal weight by the witness, approximately 600 pounds. *The witness stated he was approximately 20-30 yards from where the animal was leaning against a tree, propped by his shoulder much like a man would lean against a tree.  He stated it wasn't acting aggressive, but he observed more of a curious nature about the animal.  *Since the witness was in relative close proximity with almost a full moon above and using a bright \"high beam\" light he was able to distinguish facial features quite clearly and they are as follows:    -The eyes were large and dark brown to black and deep set.    -The witness was able to distinguish a prominent brow ridge    -The nose or nostrils were more flattened, and gorilla-like as were the lips and mouth.*Body features are as follows:*The animal was covered from head to toe in black hair \"the length of a bear's\" (medium in length) The witness stated the only area that was not covered in hair was the face.*The shoulders were broad and well muscled.  The example he provided for arm length was the length of a chimpanzee's arms as proportionate to the body, (long arms) but well muscled.*The animal was barrel chested, also muscular, not fat.*When asked about the sex of the animal, (witness used the word \"he\" in all of his descriptions) he said he did not see breasts therefore thought it was a male.*Witness turned to speak with his grandfather and when he turned back the animal was gone.*Witness stated he believed the animal knew he had seen it, so when given the opportunity had fled when the witness turned away.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke at length with the witness over the phone, during which I was impressed with the witness' recollection of detail, and ability to communicate clearly.After the initial phone conversation, I met the witness and his friend at the location of their sighting.  Both men gave very detailed information, and were able to give consistent information overall.The location of the encounter is close to my home, and I am very familiar with this area and the Buffalo Creek Rec Area and Pike National Forest areas nearby.The witnesses described driving down County Road 126 near the Buffalo Creek Recreation Area entrance at Forest Road 550 in a northeasterly direction.  There was good daylight and visibility at the time, late afternoon, and they initially saw the figure at a distance of approximately 1/10th of a mile. Both men describe seeing a very large, uniformly colored , dark grey bipedal figure with extremely heavy build cross CR 126 from east to west.  The figure climbed a very steep, sandy embankment on the west side of the road with seemingly very little effort.  The embankment is approximately 30 feet high at an angle of 45 to 50 degrees. The area in question can be viewed in Google Street View at coordinates  39.352868, -105.249695.The witnesses also mentioned that there were some deer in the area when they stopped at the road crossing site.  The deer strangely did not flee the area when the men pulled up, and were apparently present when the bipedal figure crossed the road previously. There were no footprints witnessed at the site when the men arrived.  Both men are business owners with excellent communication abilities and I considered them both to be credible witnesses after two lengthy conversations.",

            "Observed": "A friend and I had just started heading home from a day trip in the conifer area of Colorado. As we drove down a stretch of road with approx 1/2 miles visibility, we \"both\" saw a creature run from one side of the highway to the other. This creature was tall considering we had been about 4-500 hundred feet away in the car. It effortlessly took a few long strides and cleared the entire width of the road. It was clearly upright on two feet, which at that point both of us looked at each other wide eyed, like we couldn't really register what we've just saw. Once we pulled off to the spot that it had crossed, we both took notice that there was about 5-6 mule deer that seemed to be completely undisturbed or spooked. We both realized that if this was a human, these deer would not have been anywhere close to the commotion. This was my very first and only sighting and I'm absolutely positive what we saw was authentic. The mix of weather and the time of day reduced the hiker and tourist traffic that day, so the thought of someone playing games isn't a viable conclusion to me. My friend is also convinced, since he was raised in New Hampshire and has had similar experiences. Since that day, I've been hooked! My friend and I are extreme outdoorsmen with many years of survival training, so we will be spending a lot more time in the area of our sighting soon. Just FYI, the exact area of our sighting was between Wellington Lake and scraggy mountain ranch. Thanks for taking the time to read this as I'm sure you get a ton of submissions.",
