It was the second day of antlered deer season and I was surprised I didn't hear any shooting. I was near the top of a ravine/bowl and standing on the ground next to a tree where I could survey the valley and sides of the ravine.At about 3.00 to 3.30 pm I just got an odd feeling that something was wrong...really wrong. I had hunted and hiked in the woods for the past 10 years all the time and never felt that way. I have even done a lot of night hunting and was lost in the woods one night..I still never felt that way.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness over the phone.  He described the creature that he saw through the scope of his gun from 70\u0094 away to be approximately seven and a half-foot tall and bulky, perhaps weighing about 400lbs. He described the general shape of the creature to be the same shape as the Patterson Creature. He is adamant that it was not a bear, and that it stood on two legs the whole time. He states that it was covered in dark brown hair and that he could make out a patch of tan somewhere on the body. The only part of the body that he saw clearly was the arm, as the rest of the creature was partially blocked. -The tree that the creature was swaying was approximately 30\u0092 tall and about 6\u0092 in diameter. And the degree of swaying was such that it whipped back and forth enough to dislodge snow and needles from the top of the tree. -During the encounter he was still trying to rationalize in his mind what he was seeing. He could not explain the sense of \u0091foreboding and dread\u0092 he had been feeling the whole time, nor could he understand how something could have moved so quickly up a steep ravine that was covered in a foot of snow. And when he finally saw what was whipping the tree back and forth, he stated that what he was seeing should have been a deer, or something familiar, that he could wrap his mind around. Not a large, bipedal figure that was covered in hair. -He still cannot figure out how the creature disappeared so quickly and so completely while he was watching it. He thought of going to the area by the tree to look for tracks, or other evidence, but the feeling of dread was so strong that he decided against it.  -I found this witness to be honest, forthright and sincere. I believe that what he heard and saw could not be explained by anything but a bigfoot.  The vocalizations he described as sounding like a Japanese language spoken backwards may have been bigfoot language, often referred to as \"samurai chatter\".",
