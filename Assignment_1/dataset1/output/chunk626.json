            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness has spotted a large biped twice in a ten year period at the same bridge. His mother and brother also admitted seeing the same biped over the years. Its always been seen in the same area. Dark in color, always seen at dusk. About 9 ft. tall, with very wide shoulders about 4-5 ft. across.   It appears to have a large stride as it crossed the road in about 3 steps. They state that the stories go back 30 years or more. The witness reports that he and others have heard strange vocalizations on many occasions.I have found possible tracks in this same area five years ago. The first hand stories go back as many as 150 years. The area is very remote with very few people living there.  The witness is willing to show us the area, any time but night time. I have been working on finding more information about a work crew in the area having large, heavy equipment moved around that affected their job.",
