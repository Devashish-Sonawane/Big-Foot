His girl friend, \"saw it, and she started screaming.\" Bullock related. He said he did not see the \"thing,\" but Barbara described it as \"huge,\" about 10-feet-tall, with a head as large as a steering wheel. It looked \"black\" Barbara told Tim, with a round, \"hairy\" face. Tim and Barbara left the area and reported the incident to Herrin police, he said. Bullock said he returned to the area the next day and found a depression in the grass, indicating a large animal had rested or slept there. Residents in the area told him their dogs had been barking loudly and \"carrying on\" at night for two weeks. Since this all took place Bullock said a carhop at a Herrin area drive-in restaurant told him someone else came to the drive-in \"hysterical\" and reported seeing the creature. At least one other person said he saw \"it\" near Rt 148, Bullock added. Curious area residents who heard the reports drove through the Chittyville area last weekend, but saw no traces of the \"thing.\" Herrin police said residents reported sighting some type of strange animal several months ago. It turned out to be a stray Bull.  ",
