            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length regarding his experience in the Coeur d'Alene National Forest. His written report was very thorough and his verbal retelling added only a couple of additional details.First, I asked him to explain specifically how the old footprint he found differed from 'typical' sasquatch print descriptions. He said the heel of the print was very narrow (more narrow than a bare human foot) in relation to the width, making the print almost triangular. This puzzled him and it does me also. Although no claw prints were visible, this sounds like a possible bear footprint where a hind foot oversteps (and overlays) the front footprint on the same side of the animal. When this occurs, one long, wide print appears that usually has a narrow heal. Without further examination, we will never know for sure.Also, he remembered that the print he found looked like a left footprint (toe marks longer on the right). He was surprised that no companion print(s) could be seen.Then, I asked about any sounds he could remember hearing at the peak when the 'stump' disappeared. He recalled that it was completely silent, save for the occasional sounds of wind gusts moving through the treetops below him. In recalling this, he remembered how strange it seemed to him that whatever appeared as a dark shadow or 'stump' was able to move silently out of view while he glanced the other way.In summary, I think the most likely explanation for the shadowy shape he saw watching him from the tree line is that it was a curious sasquatch. The other possible identities seem less likely. It did not have the shape that a large bear would (with sloped shoulders), and disappeared without the typical crashing or crunching sounds a bear often makes. A human seems equally unlikely given the remote location and the large size of the stump. Additionally, the uneasy feeling of being watched together with a silent, large dark figure blending into the forest are oft-reported characteristics of a sasquatch encounter.",

The creature was very tall, with black hair mixed with gray covering its entire body. The hair had a matted look, described as a \u0093dreadlocks.\u0094 There was no opportunity to view the face or front of the creature as they were traveling in the same direction. The wood knocking and vocalizations it made gave him the impression of a display to encourage his departure. He felt uneasy about staying once the noises stopped. Immediately after the creature became silent, he departed and continued home. He waited several months to tell anyone other than immediate family of his sighting. His first revelation was to a state park employee, who told him \u0093You've seen a bigfoot. Go on line and report it! Following his urging, he went to the BFRO sight and discovered his sighting was similar to others from around the country. ",
