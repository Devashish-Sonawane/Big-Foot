            "Follow-Up Report": "I had a lengthy conversation with the witness. He is very intelligent and educated. He is a biologist with a major, worldwide company, and is very aware of the world around him. From a scientific point of view, he knows what should, and should not be, in the scientific natural order of things. He is knowledgeable of wildlife and the woods, and in his opinion, there was something alive \"messing\" with him throughout the night. Most of what he has reported we, as investigators, have heard before. He was especially unnerved by the \"women voices\" he heard, as they made him sure there were some campers walking towards him. I stopped him in mid-description, before he was going to give me an example of what he heard. I gave him my example of what he was about to say, and nailed it dead on. He was shocked, but I told him I had heard it before and recorded it. Women, or children, mumbling in a sort of sing song whisper. Barely audible, but there. But the rock clacks, howls, sticks breaking and throwing, twisted trees, stick structures, something messing with his ropes and zippers. He had the whole SAS  experience. He had the whole SAS  experience. But the one thing missing was he did not \"see\" anything, but he knew there was \"someone or something\" there. There were moments where he could have turned around and possibly \"seen\" whoever or whatever was there, but being alone, he was quite unnerved by the activity and chose to just lie there and be still, and soak it all in. He did, on a couple of occasions, turn around and whatever activity was going on stopped immediately, then began back up as he resumed his previous position. As you can tell by his copious notes, he is very detail oriented. If you consider that if only one or two of the incidents happened as he described, you might write it off as a spooked camper out alone for the first time, but given the entire range of incidents, there is a likelihood that what he experienced probably happened as he described. In that this report was incredibly detailed, had he actually seen a creature(s), I am certain the detail would have been minute to the last follicle. He sent me these photos he took of the broken trees, hard to see much detail:",
