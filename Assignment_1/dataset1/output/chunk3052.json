            "Observed": "In late spring of 1970 while traveling south between Gatlinburg, Tn and Cherokee, N.C. on Hiway 441 somewhere near the state line in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. We sighted a very tall hairy creature. We were crusing down the road wondering if we would see any bear and as we rounded a curve there was this creature coming from the right side of the road down grade from some small trees and bushes that still had leaves. It moved across the road directly in front of us and after entering the bushes on the left side of the road angled off the same direction we were traveling. We could still see it's head for a few seconds before it dissapeared. I would guess the height to be somewhere in the 7+ foot tall range. It had a very long stride and walked like a human swinging it's long arms with it's stride. It covered the distance of 100 ft or so in seconds.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was interviewed by phone. He was quite matter of fact and certain of his sighting. The witness and his wife were driving through the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and the animal walked out in front of their car, moving from one side of the road to the other side. The witness stated the following about the sighting and the animal:-The animal crossed the road (on 2 legs) in 5-6 steps.-The animal was about 7 ft tall.-As the animal walked, it looked forward, never turning the head nor hesitating as it walked.-The hands were folded up slightly, palms facing backwards.-The arms were long and reached towards the knees.-The shoulder to hip area was long.-The hair/fur was (somewhat) lighter than a walnut brown color, but in that shade. Hair/fur appeared to be about 3\" in length and uniform in its length.-The animal was \"very clean\" and not shaggy at all.-The animal walked with arms straight to the side and seemed to walk with his broad shoulders \"back\".-The head did not appear to be pointed. The neck was not visible.-The animal appeared to be \"very human-like\".",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone:  It was July or August, 1982. He believes the horse saw the figure first. Then he saw it for about ten seconds. He described it as about eight feet tall, but remembers that it seemed \"bigger than life.\" It was dark brown with hair about three inches long, but with shorter hair on the head. It had a huge body with a head that flowed into the shoulders. He describes the face as more similar to a human but the dark eyes were farther apart than a person. The mouth was closed. The arms were down to the knees and he saw arms swing as it walked away. He did not detect any foul odor.He was so shaken up and they ran with the horse for awhile. He said, \"It would have been faster to get away on the horse.\" He has never been back to Bald Butte and he never talked about seeing a Bigfoot until a few years ago. The BFRO report he refers to is #672.",
