The most recent sighting was 10-8-2006 and I'm telling you it was 7\"2 and huge, with big yellow eyes. It was watching my husband put our puppies in the fenced in dog pen. I just grabbed my 3 year old son and slowly walked to the porch. My husband didn't even know at that time that he was being watched. Later on that night he seen something very big and he heard it walking closer to him.... He ran inside and we locked the door. He advised to me that it was no bear that could stand that tall, walk on hind legs!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I called the witness on 11 October 2006. She relates that the family has seen a family of Sasquatches since first moving to the present home in the mid 1990's.  She has seen them around the property over the years since she was 6 years old. There are four adults and three children living on the property. Something has removed food scraps from the burning barrel where they dispose of their household trash. When the animals come to the property looking for food, they do not seem to be intimidated by the human presence The height of the creatures was as follows: 7' 2\u0094; 5' 9\u0094;  and 4' 5\u0094. The larger one was nearly black and had hair which looked well groomed/taken care of. The two smaller ones were somewhat lighter, maybe dark brown.  All of the animals had hair in the three to four inch long range.  She said most of the sightings have been late in the evening. The gunshot which was to scare the animals away has not kept them from returning. They have had one young dog killed by an unknown animal. The dog had been ripped open in the area of the abdomen. They have arranged for a video camera and will attempt to film any of the creatures during their next visit. 10/23/06- Witness called to report a family friend came face to face with an 8-foot sasquatch when they departed after dark. The creature was in the vicinity of a bowl of dog food on their porch.A BFRO investigator (Maisel -OH) has recently visited this location and heard possible sounds coming from the woods.  The situation here will be monitored.  Any other BFRO people wanting to assist should contact Willis or Maisel.",
