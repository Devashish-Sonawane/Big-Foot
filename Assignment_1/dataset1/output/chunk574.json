I had taken the youngest child(about 6) with me, and the other kids(mostly late teens) were looking for us. We were hiding in an overgrown ditch near our home, in a fairly populus, rural area. We both heard a strange groaning noise coming from the direction of some nearby appartments. The little boy I was with, was quite afraid, and wanted to go inside. I scared him so bad, he was crying. We went inside, and I told my wife, the boys mother, and the other kids about the sound. We all went into the yard, and heard the groans. I just listened to the Mississippi groans, and that was what i heard. I also checked to see if there was anymore sightings in my area, and I am about 25 miles from the Lanier county Georgia sighting.",

The area in general is rural with populated areas surrounded by pine forests and swamp with numerous creeks and lakes. There is a large population of deer and wild hog in this area. The area the witness heard the howl was about 150 yards away from his house. The area is wooded with a canal close by. There are sinkholes scattered throughout this area.He reported that a friend had seen a large bipedal creature crossing the road near this area in 1998. There are also numerous reports of large, long tailed black cats from this area of south Georgia.",
