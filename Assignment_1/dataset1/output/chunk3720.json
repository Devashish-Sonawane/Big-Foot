            "Follow-Up Report": "This report was submitted to the BFRO website by the witness' grandson. I spoke with the witness J.H. at length on 10-6-09. The witness was sitting quietly, squirrel hunting in late September 1972. The sighting occurred early morning just after daylight. The leaves had not yet fallen. He described the creature as reddish brown, very muscular, strong legs, at least 7 feet tall, weighing approximately 400-500 pounds.The witness did not hear the creature, but saw it at a distance of about 70 yards, moving away from him from right to left. The area at the time of the sighting was old growth timber, rough terrain, but has since been developed for natural gas exploration, and much of the old growth timber has been cut. The witness watched the creature as it walked casually away on two legs, pausing briefly and looking around before continuing on. He did not feel that it was aware of his presence. After the creature was out of sight, the witness looked for tracks. He found 4 or 5 human shaped, but much larger, footprints about an inch deep, with slight toe markings. He stated that his shoes made hardly any mark at all. The witness' father, now deceased, also saw a similar creature in the same area 3 years before. An avid hunter, the witness stated that he had not seen anything like this since, and was not aware of any other sightings or stories from the area.  ",
