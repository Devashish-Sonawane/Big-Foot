            "Environment": "Silver Star Scenic Area is undoubtedly gorgeous. Silver Star Mountain itself is a craggy inactive volcano with lots of loose/jagged rock and cliffs and is roughly 4,300 ft in elevation. There are trees below the mountain, but not on the mountain top itself. Flowers were starting to bloom and things were very green. Areas not vegetated with coniferous trees were mainly covered in grasses and boulder fields. There are streams and rivers flowing down from the mountain into all of the surrounding valleys. When you sit on top of the rocks and take in the views to the east, the next prominent ridgeline is Little Baldy Peak. There are valleys on either side (north and south) of this ridge that connect Silver Star Mountain and Little Baldy Peak. The north valley is where the sounds were heard. I can provide photos I took at that exact moment for context and would be happy to markup a map of where the sounds came from (roughly the headwaters of Star Creek).",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness explained to me that he is an environmental scientist and is very educated on wildlife and their sounds in the area. He and his girlfriend hike Silver Star Mt. frequently. On their 3rd trip this spring is when he had his first encounter hearing vocalizations. Conditions:There was still some snow near the topTemps were mild in the 50s. Windy but nothing major. Occasional gusts. Description of encounter:They heard an extremely loud noise from down in the canyon.Looking east, the sound echoed from northern area of canyon. The noise was described as a whoop beginning with a low deep pitch then increasing to a very high pitch. An increase described as several octaves. Too low for human then too high for human in his opinion. The sound had a human element but projected over a greater distance at a volume a human could not duplicate. The witness said the hair stood up on the back of his neck. He said they had a 2nd experience at Silver Star after that. They went back around June 20th. No snow left. Arrived around 6pm. They saw Mt Goats. Maybe re-introduced to the area like Mt. St. Helens. They set up camp and went to bed about 10:30pm. Around 2:00am or 2:30am he awoke to something hitting the tent pole. He believes rocks or small pebbles. He heard something rustling outside the tent and thought maybe it was the goats they had seen. He raised up and made noise and whatever it was ran off and was so heavy it shook the ground and with what sounded like extremely heavy footsteps. It was so fast it was out of ear shot within 3 seconds. The campsite was in lots of rock and shale. No tracks found. No smells noted. He said wildflowers were in bloom, but a bit cold for berries that early. Additional Info:He also said they hiked Mt. Jefferson earlier in June and found tracks. He will email the pictures of those tracks. Aerial and Topo of the area:",
