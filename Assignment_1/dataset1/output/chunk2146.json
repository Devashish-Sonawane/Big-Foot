            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness JS and found him to be sincere and forthright in the description of his encounter. While driving south on route 77, near the Salt Fork Lake State Park in Ohio, JS passed something huddled on the side of the road. It was lying up against the guardrail, between the railing and the yellow line on the edge of the highway. At first he thought it was a bear but then realized that it was a humanoid shape that was in a hunched or crouched position, much like the duck and cover position that 1950's school children were instructed to do when going through a nuclear alarm test, on the knees with the head ducked low. His first thought was that whatever it was, had been hit by a car because of its position and location on the side of the road.Confused at what he had seen, JS quickly stopped and put the car in reverse. As soon as he backed up to it, the creature then stood up on two legs and stepped over the 3\u00bd-4\u0092 guardrail and walked into the woods. JS said that once he had backed his car up, he was about 15\u0092 to 20\u0092 feet away from the creature covered with well-kept, long brownish-gray hair and the back was hairier than the front. He likened the length and texture of its hair to that of \u0091Cousin It\u0092 from the TV show \u0091The Addams Family\u0092, smooth and flowing. JS stated that he did not see its face but did remember quite distinctly that it had no ears.  The head was more of an \u0091oval\u0092 shape, rather than a circular shape, and its head sat squarely on its shoulders. The shoulders were \u0091massive\u0092, probably three times the width of his own shoulders, and the torso and legs were huge and \u0091thick\u0092. He also emphasized that the hands were also \u0091huge\u0092 and that they hung down to its knees. When asked for an estimate of the weight and size, JS told me that it exceeded 6\u0092 5\u0094 and weighed close to 500lbs, maybe more.JS commented that in the 15 to 20 seconds he observed the creature, he could see such details about the creature because there was quite a bit of moonlight present at the time. After he lost sight of the creature, he noticed a large pond lit up by moonlight in the bottom of a nearby valley. With the window rolled down, he noted quite a stench in the vicinity, described as being between a skunk and a fishy smell. He did not feel safe in getting out of his car because of what he had just witnessed.While reviewing this encounter which occurred near the Salt Fork Lake State Park, I found that there are five other reports that have also occurred in the same vicinity. They are reports #8843, #9281, #9188, #15371 and #15876. The Salt Fork Lake State Park borders Route 77 and has a land area of over 17,000 acres of wilderness which includes lakes, streams, woods and marshes, as well as the Salt Fork Lake that is @ 3000 acres in size.
