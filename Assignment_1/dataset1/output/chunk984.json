            "Observed": "I think I might have seen a big foot on May 30, 2012.  I went outside to put my trash can at the street at about midnight. The only light was the porch lights on the house behind us.  When I walked around the corner of the house, I froze because I saw what looked like something standing at my neighbor's fence. They have a fence that is fenced in on three sides, just not at the front of the house, and what I saw was standing at the back of the fence, I think on my side of the fence, but not sure. All I could see was the silhouette of a person/thing, but it stood 1 1/2 to 2 feet over the top of the fence. All I could see was the silhouette of the shoulders and head and hair sticking up over the fence. It had long hair and it was not really moving.  Only the hair would move. At first I thought it was a person who had stopped and stood still when it saw me.  Then I realized it was way too big to be a person.  I admittedly have bad eyesight though, even with glasses on at night. On top of that I am a logical person with a master's degree, so I don't rush to conclusions, especially fanciful ones.  So I told myself it was just the shadows and light playing tricks on me.  I figured that something was propped up against the fence and just looked like a head and shoulders in the dark and that maybe the hair was some spanish moss caught on whatever it was. But I still felt uneasy and ran inside as fast as I could.  The next day (today) I went outside and looked for whatever it was that might have looked like a head and shoulders. But there as nothing there.  No plants, no trees, nothing propped up against the fence, no spanish moss, just a fence.  We went back outside tonight to look again and see if there was anything casting a funky shadow.  While that corner of the yard is dark and lights barely shine there from the windows, there was definitely nothing taller than the fence and nothing that looked like a head and shoulders. I would estimate, given that the fence is about 6 feet tall, that it was at least 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 feet tall.  It was broad shouldered. And it had long hair or fur on it's head.  I am not saying it was a bigfoot, because I could not see it well enough to say that for certain, but I don't think it was a person. If it was a person it was a very large, very tall, very hairy person.  Also, when I came back inside, my dog (a lab/border collie mix who is about 90 lbs) started growling.  He kept growling until I let him out of his kennel and he immediately ran to my back door.  I let him outside and he shot off.  Our yard is fenced in so he cannot leave the yard.  But ten minutes later when I went to let him back in, he wasn't near the back door. It took several minutes for him to come back to the door after I called repeatedly.  That is not like him.  He usually is begging to come back inside and doesn't hesitate when I call him.  After that he was very restless all night.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness lives in a newer subdivision that borders a large forest with her husband and toddler.  The witness went outside her house around midnight to put the trash out on the curb.  On the night of May 30, 2012, the moon was a waxing gibbous and five days away from being full so there was enough light to see a silhouette standing by the neighbor\u0092s fence.  She saw what appeared to be a large head and very full shoulders standing behind a 6 ft. fence; it was looking towards her. The back fence was about 50 ft. from where she was standing and although she could not see facial details, she was able to see long hair moving in the wind around the head and shoulders.  She thought at first it might be a prowler, but quickly realized how tall it was to stand head and shoulders over a 6 ft. fence.   She felt very uneasy and could feel the hair on her neck stand up in fear. Quickly dragging her can to the curb, she retreated inside the house.  Once inside her dog uncharacteristically began growling. She let him out, and it stayed out longer than usual. When he returned after repeated calls, it was from the direction of where the silhouette had been.Later that night when she went to sleep, a loud bang was heard. It seemed something had hit the bedroom wall which is located in the back of her house. With further questioning I learned that on occasion, late at night, the family experiences sounds that seem to be objects hitting the back wall loudly, or small rocks/acorns hitting the back windows.  At another time when she and her husband came home, they thought a person had gone through their trash because the bag had been opened neatly and taken out of the can. It was obvious an animal had not gotten into it because there was not a mess.  Also the can had not been tipped over.The subdivision literally sits on the border of Lee County and Dougherty County. It is within 3 miles of Report #18707 and Report #24393.After speaking with the witness and researching the local area, I believe she may have seen a Sasquatch.  The unexplainable sounds of things hitting the house supports typical Sasquatch behavior too. When looking at the location of her house it is possible that Bigfoots go scavenging through the new neighborhood from the forest. Garbage cans and backyard gardens could provide a food source.",

It is only accessible by one road which continues past the lakes to extensive logging loads typical of this country. The area is lowland with numerous marshes punctuated by steep round hills. The area does not receive persistent snow cover. The land has since been logged and a large church camp built along the shore. The forest was replanted and appears to be about 10 years old. The state map indicates Hannon Lake has fish but State Fish & Game does not list it as a fishing lake possibly because it is now privately owned.",
