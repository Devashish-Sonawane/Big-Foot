            "Observed": "During the evening my friend and I parked at the end of an old alder road behind locked gates to bowhunt for elk. When it started getting dark we decided to circle back to the pick up; we were approx. 2 miles away on the top end of the mountain along the east side of the ridge line. I had forgotten to bring my flashlight so my buddy had to shine his light for both him and I while we walked out. During the walk while we were crossing the top of the ridge we could notice an awful smell; the smell was kind of moldy or musky so we thought it was probably just a bear that had gotten into some swampy skunk cabbage or something similiar. We continued to notice the terrible smell off and on all the way back to the truck.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This report is of particular interest to me because as a 10 year-old, I lived in the same town, so I was familiar with the places.  The witness and I talked for an hour about his experience.  Since the incident happened so many years ago, and the site is behind a locked gate many miles, going to the site was not necessary.  As some background, this witness is Native American.  He has lived in and hunted in the area his whole life. He is a reliable expert on the game animals of the area.  Two items stand out in his report.  First is the persistent smell.  He described it as a musky, wet-fur smell.  It seemed to go along with them as they walked out of the woods in the dark, and after they reached the old road, it still was present.  He got the impression that it followed along, and he reported the feeling of being watched.  Second, they found a clear, 16 inch long footprint in the tire tracks of their vehicle.  This place was behind a locked gate, so there were no other people there.  His hunting buddy had a key to the gate, so they were the only people in the area.The witness mentioned that neither he nor his hunting partner said anything to anyone about the incident for many years.  Later, he confided in his brother about what happened.  His brother then told him that his hunting partner had also told him (the brother) of the incident, and that despite the long time since it happened that both told the same account exactly and in great detail.  Based on the smell, the finding of the footprints in their tire tracks, and that they were the only humans in the area, I conclude that the witness and his friend were followed by a curious sasquatch.
