At about 3am we both heard a long high pitched whoop that i've never heard before and i've lived and hunted in fl my whole life. I have never experienced anything like it, the way it made the hair on my neck stand up. I told my daughter it was nothing but needless to say i was awake the rest of the night. this was in 07 and i havn't thought much about it until last night i was watching Finding Bigfoot and BoBo made a call and the hair stood up again, it wasn't exactly like it but pretty close. Maybe someone can tell me what this was because the closest animal i can link it to is a Panther witch sounds like a woman screaming but this wasn't a panther.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to RK over the phone and he gave me more details of what he heard. About 3am RK was awakened to the sound of a long, moaning call coming from a swampy area approximately \u00bd mile away from his campsite. He said that there were four calls in a row with 30 seconds between the first two calls and about 10 seconds between the next three calls and lasted about four seconds apiece. They started out with a sort of groan and then tapered off to a higher pitch and that they were very powerful.He stated that the call closely resembled the 1994 Ohio - Moaning Howl. He also stated that the call Bobo made on the TV series \u0091Finding Bigfoot\u0092 was similar except that Bobo\u0092s voice was lower than what he heard.RK mentioned that he was born and raised in Florida and is very comfortable in the woods. He stated that what he heard that night was unlike any animal he had ever heard before, including panthers, bobcats, coyotes, hogs and alligators. Gore\u0092s Landing sits right on the edge of the Oklawaha River, in the middle of a huge tract of State owned lands that is part of the Ocala National Forest. The BFRO has held three public expeditions in this forest to date because of the reports we receive.This satellite map shows just how remote the area is\u0085",
