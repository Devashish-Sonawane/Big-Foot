            "Follow-Up Report": "On 3/31/2019, we spoke with the witness and his wife on the phone. They recounted that they were camping with their teenage son outside Bonner, MT. The husband and wife were in a large canvas tent and their son was in a smaller vinyl tent. Their camp was at a dead-end road with a large berm to keep people from driving down an old logging road. The witness mentioned that the grass and vegetation was so overgrown it was difficult to hike back there and that it was obviously not frequently used. They mentioned they leave their campsite up all summer long to use for recreational purposes. A month or so after they were using their camp, the husband had gone to use their camp latrine (A 5 gallon bucket with a trash bag inside). He did not feel watched, smell anything bad, or have any noises he noticed. He came back to camp and the wife went to use the camp latrine. When she opened the bucket, there were many large rocks inside. So many she was upset she could not use the camp latrine. She indicated the rocks to be softball size or bigger. Another instance they mentioned on the phone was their teenage son was sleeping in his tent in the middle of the night and had something grab the sides of the tent and begin dragging it back towards the berm and old overgrown trail. He began hollering for his mom and she ran out of her tent. Neither the son or the mom were able to see what drug the tent. She indicated the poles to have left a skid mark of about a foot and a half. the son refuses to go back to that area. The husband also mentioned that there was an older retired man who was camped the next ridge over from them. They ran into him after their experiences and were bringing it up in conversation. The old man said that he had experiences as well, and they swapped contact information. We asked for them to give us a warm hand-off to be in touch with this witness, however we have not received any contact information at this time (6/21/19). We exchanged text messages and emails frequently after the initial phone contact there was too much snow to get into the location. The witness was very responsive and was closely monitoring that location for the snow to melt to be able to get back to camp. On 4/13/19 Thomas did the following research on nearby wildfires:2011 West Riverside Firehttps://www.makeitmissoula.com/2011/08/earth-wind-and-fire-bonner-fire/Fire burned 3,797 acres in the Lolo National Forest and Rattlesnake National Rec Area2003 Mineral Primm and Mineral Boles Fireshttp://leg.mt.gov/content/committees/interim/2011-2012/EQC/minutes/September-15-2011/Exhibit03.pdfFires burned:Mineral Boles 20,713 acresMineral Primm 24,205 acresThese fires burned within a few miles of the location. These fires have cleared numerous acres of woods and scrub brush leaving minimum cover but allowing great sight lines for research. I have investigated the burn area to the north back in 2015 with little to no evidence of what created the tracks from the report. Report number 48722 is roughly 2-5 miles north. With continued investigation into the area we hope to glean more information to back up both reports and add legitimacy to this area and future reports that are received from this area.The burn areas allow for greater grazing areas for deer and elk, and bigger areas for berries that bears will eat before winter on set.With this report and information coming forward it has created a renewed interest into this area.We scheduled a time and location to meet the husband and wife witnesses on 04/27/19. They agreed, however when we arrived they did not show up. We attempted to call, text and email and every attempt was blocked by the witnesses on their end. Not sure why the witnesses had been so forthcoming and then very quickly not. We had verified we would be meeting as recently as two days prior to the scheduled meet-up. Photos of wildfire areas:We did drive to the location from the directions given in the initial phone call and were able to locate the area rather easily. We plan to go to this location this summer and hopefully the witnesses will continue to use the camp location and we can continue to attempt to recreate what happened and get measurements of the area. We are submitting the report as a Class B and will continue to investigate this area. If we are able to contact the witnesses again, we will update as appropriate. ",

On the second day we were following Lion creek which is about 7 miles of just animal trails we had come across multiple spots where bear and elk had been sleeping and at one point we were  about 10 min behind what we originally thought to be a bear, but once we reached its nesting spot we found huge prints that were about 16 inches long and about 7-9 inches wide, we were so close to what I can only describe now as a squatch that we could still smell it in the nest. We stayed there for about 10 min then continued to hike about 5 min later we started to hear tree knocks and such things.",
