Within minutes this same group ran back over the road in the other direction only this time into a wide open clearcut next to the timber.",

            "Also Noticed": "On Halloween weekend of 2005, several relatives and I went to this park to explore in the afternoon.  I\u0092ve found lots of tree sign and wanted to show them.  We took the main trail and came to a spot where the main preserve begins.  There\u0092s a swamp there and a foot trail or two going into the preserve (no main trail).  At this spot, my brother began doing his Bigfoot calls which he does very well.  My niece began making wood knocks with a large branch.  This went on for several minutes as we walked around having fun.  Suddenly a few of us heard a low growl coming from in the preserve.  There was talking and day noises going on (the area is not secluded but in the midst of civilization), so it wasn\u0092t heard by everyone in our party as we were scattered as well.  Also, the growl was not high pitched.  It was very low and rumbly and I could feel the vibration of it.  My brother said whatever was making that growl had to be a very large creature.  The growl happened approximately three separate times in a row.  We were amazed.  We never saw what was doing the growling, but I felt it was definitely a warning growl from a Bigfoot to make us stop imitating their sounds and knocks.  My brother put it like this (from the Bigfoot):  \u0093Okay, you know we\u0092re here and now you know we know that you know.  Now get the hell out and leave us alone!\u0094",

I knew that many sightings had occurred after rainfall.  One night last August, after a day of bad storms that ended by evening, on a whim I decided to drive to this park at night.  It was an eerie night with distant lightning flashes in the sky.  There\u0092s a road that leads to a parking lot.  At one point the road sharply veers to the right into the parking lot.  If you were to go straight, you would be driving down a private drive.",
