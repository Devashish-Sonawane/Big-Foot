It was in July 1997 I had been fishing near the bridge over Spring River and decided to move downstream a bit. As I came around a large group of oak trees I saw a figure walking from the stream towards the woods. At first I thought it was a hunter but realized it was too large to be a man 7-8 foot tall at least and probably over 600 pound ( I'm 6' 3\" and it was taller than me). It had long reddish brown hair kind of matted or curly looking. I was approximately 100 yards from it. I don't know if it saw me or not but it didn't seem to be in any rush to get into the woods. I watched it for at least five minutes before I couldn't see it anymore. I thought about trying to follow it but since I was alone I thought better of it, but I did go back the next day in the afternoon to see if I could find any footprints but didn't find anything that I could say definately belonged to the thing I saw.",
