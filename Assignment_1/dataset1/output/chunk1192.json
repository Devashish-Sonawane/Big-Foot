The witness also states he neither saw nor heard anything that would cause him to suspect there were any other people camping in the area from where the return originated.  The witness reported the return vocalization to be \"non-threatening\", possibly as distant as one mile away and was a single vocalization of approx. 3 seconds in duration.  Although an echo was noted on his own vocalization calls, no echo was reported on the return vocalization.  The witness did not attempt to investigate the area the following morning for any sign, nor did he have anything further to report regarding this incident.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "In the late fall of 2012, the witness and his son were remodeling the bathroom. They had been going in and out of the house to cut boards by the light of a pole light outside. The son carried one board in and the witness grabbed a second board, as he did he looked out over the backyard. The outside light cast a shadow over the trees in the backyard. As he looked around he noticed a raunchy smell like something dead. Then he noticed that he had one too many trees in the yard. The \u0093tree\u0094 took a step and a half crossing the 10 ft. wide path of light.  The creature was 8ft tall, about 500lbs, graying hair like you get as you get older with patches of dark brown. The creature was very muscular with knee length arms. The witness, a fifteen-year marine veteran, stated that he had seen a lot of things, but not once did he think of grabbing a gun and going to look for tracks. He knew what he saw. Two nights later his brother who is a pastor saw the same creature cross between his truck and a car in front of him in his headlights. Two nights after that the witness and his 27 year-old son were leaning against the tail gate of the pickup, as they looked across the yard. The son said \"there\u0092s a little one at the edge of the woods\". As they watched the \u0093little one\u0094 stood up to be the 8ft adult that was seen four nights before. Shortly after that, a few days later, the nieces came running in screaming, saying something was after them and had been throwing rocks at them. The witness and his brother grabbed two rifles a 30-06 and an AR-15. They stood on the pool deck looking around to see what was going on. The longer they stood the more the cool night air took its toll. The witness started inside only to hear his brother a pastor of many years exclaim s**t. The brother stated that when he moved to go in, the creature also moved from behind the tree it had been watching from. The brother was wide-eyed with disbelief as he was told \"welcome to the club\".Since that first night the witness posted on Facebook for the world to see, not caring what people thought because he KNEW. He received a call from his neighbor. That same night as the witness saw the creature; she couldn\u0092t sleep and had gone out to her deck. While on the deck she observed what was apparently the same creature eating pears from her tree. Since then he has had many people step forward with their own sightings.The witness has had 6in diameter trees torn apart, rocks, dirt and other objects thrown in their direction. Just in the past week rocks were thrown. He reports that the creature has never tried to hit them - or has really poor aim.",
