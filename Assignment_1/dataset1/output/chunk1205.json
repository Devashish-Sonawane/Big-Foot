            "Follow-Up Report": "Interviewed witness via phone. He recalled everything with clarity even though this was a 40 year old event. Right after the incident he wrote down the key points for later reference. He put the sheet in a drawer where it has remained all these years.They were driving along the gravel levee road abut 7:45 to 8pm. It was dusk. The creature emerged from below the levee road through some tall grass. There is a catch basin below the levee on the east side. The catch basin (ditch) is where they had dug up the dirt when they built the levee up years ago and it remains full of water most of the time, swampy and muddy.The creature came up about 50 yards away at first, and as they were moving and it was walking. They eventually kept about a 100 ft distance between them as they were moving and it was walking. It never turned towards them and seemed \"to know exactly where it was going, walked with purpose\".As for the physical description and movement: \"It was walking with a human like gait, arms swinging and leaning slightly forward\". \"It had reddish brown hair, a neck and head\". \"We could not determine head shape because there was so much hair\". There did appear to be a neck versus the head sitting on the shoulders according to him.It crossed the road in front of them, still at about the 100 foot range. The width of the levee road is pretty typical size wise, about a two lane rural gravel road. As they slowed down to a crawl, to where it had walked down the opposite side of the levee, it was no longer visible through the brush. There was however, the \"very strong odor that smelled musty and putrid like an old big cat exhibit at the old municipal zoo.\"They both agreed it was \"at least 7ft. tall\". That was based on just knowing \"it was bigger than a really tall man\".He said \"we weren't drinking or anything like that\". Just two friends out driving around. He indicated he was going to reach out to his friend very soon and see if they can have a conversation about the event. They are both getting along in age, mid to late 60's, and he said he would contact me after they connect.Good guy, and good witness.",
