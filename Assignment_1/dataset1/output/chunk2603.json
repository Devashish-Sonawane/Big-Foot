At a point on 54 between the railroad tracks that has an overpass and going west to the top of the hill at the state line my head lights caught something upright on two legs very big, very dark, step off the road to the south side, I only got a look for second but it sent chills up my back. I told my wife about it, she thought I was nuts for watching Finding Bigfoot too much tonight, then I read your website about a trucker in the same area seeing something on 54.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness by phone. After considerable questioning I found him to be credible. He added the following:He was on his way to work in his car. The car is an older model and the headlights are not as strong as he would like them to be. He was westbound on Highway 54, crossed under the railroad and started up a hill towards the Kansas State Line. On the left is a small field of oil derricks. As he was driving he saw a figure standing on the left side of the road in the area of these derricks. In his headlights he could only see from the knees up but was struck by the appearance of a large very stocky upright body from the thighs to the chest. He could see an arm and dimly make out the head. The hair on it was very black and had a sheen in the lights. It immediately moved off of the highway to the left. The encounter was brief, only a second or two, but the witness is sure about what he had seen. He was tempted to turn around and shine his headlights off of the highway but was late for work. He stated he has been very hesitant to discuss this with anyone for fear of being ridiculed. After my interview with this witness I believe he is being truthful. Please see Report #36572.",
