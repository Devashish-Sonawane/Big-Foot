            "Observed.1  ": "Described by eyewitnesses as a small, hairy,  \"mini-Bigfoot\" creature, the Stump Jumper  has been seen in the swamps a few miles  east of Two Egg, Florida, for many years. The  sightings usually take place in the woods  around the ghost town of Old Parramore and  it was in that vicinity that the latest sightings  took place.  The latest incidents include both visual  sightings of the monster as well as reports of  mysterious growling or \"roaring\" sounds  being heard from a swampy area.  Reports of the mysterious \"growls\" or \"roars\"  began in early May when a group of six  people were returning to the picnic area at  Parramore Landing Park following a  sundown hike into the deep woods and  swamps that adjoin the park. As the group  approached the picnic area, it noticed that  something seemed to be following them. The hiking party included a county official, an  optometrist, a retired journalist, an attorney  and two others. The only member willing to be identified so  far is retired journalist and noted historian  Dale Cox. He said that a strange sensation  came over the group members as they  realized they were being followed. \"I don't really know how to describe it,\" he  said. \"I've spent decades of my life in and  around these woods and swamps and  sometimes you just get a feeling that  something is there, watching you as you go  past.\" \"It was like that,\" he continued. Cox said that the members of the group  never actually saw what was shadowing  them, but as they reached the mowed grass  of the picnic area, they heard a startling  sound. \"We had just crossed over into the picnic  area when a sound that I can only describe  as a sort of growling roar came out of the  woods from behind us,\" he said.  The  eyewitness noted that he had grown up in the  vicinity, but had \"never heard anything like it.\" The roar was definitely from an animal and  its volume was astounding, he and the other  members of the party agreed. \"We heard it twice more,\" he said, \"each time  closer to us and louder.\" The witnesses debated what the sound  could be, ruling out a bull alligator, which has  a roar but one that is distinctly different from  the sound they heard. The closest animal  sounds they could compare it were from  either a lion or a gorilla. \"It sounded something like the loud roars  that you hear lions and gorillas give on tv or  at the zoo,\" Cox said.  \"We all are familiar with the Stump Jumper  stories,\" he continued, \" so it didn't take long  for us to wonder if we were about to see it.\" The strange sounds from the swamps  around Parramore Landing Park have been  reported by three other eyewitness groups.  All were returning from fishing on Lake  Seminole at sundown or shortly after dark  when they heard a load \"roar\" from an  unidentified creature. As was the case with  the first group, all have indicated that the  sound was unlike anything they had heard  before in the area. There also has been one visual sighting of  the creature.  During the second week of June, an  eyewitness says she saw the Two Egg  Stump Jumper while driving west on Circle  Hill Road from its intersection with Oak Grove  Road, not far from Circle Hill Baptist Church  in the Parramore community. The sighting location was in a swampy area  about 100 yards west of the church and  about 3.7 miles northwest of Parramore  Landing. According to the eyewitness, who asked not  to be publicly identified, the creature ran from  left to right (south to north) across the dirt  road. She saw it in the headlights of her car  as she was driving west on Circle Hill Road  at about 9 p.m. She described it as \"short, shorter than I  expected, kind of grey colored and covered  with hair.\"   The description was consistent with those  provided by other witnesses, who describe  the Two Egg Stump Jumper as being about  5-feet tall, covered in hair and brown or grey  in color. It was upright and running at a  remarkable speed each time it has been  sighted. The new eyewitness verified the speed at  which the creature runs when she said, \"It  was fast, really fast!\"",
