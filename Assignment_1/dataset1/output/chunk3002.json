            "Follow-Up Report": "I discussed this incident with both father and son and found them to be credible. It is still a vivid memory for both of them, nine years after the fact. The location is approximately 25 miles east of Brigham City and 18 miles northeast of Huntsville, in the Monte Cristo Range of the larger Bear River Range of the Wasatch-Cache National Forest, east of Ant Flat Road in Ant Valley and south of the Hardware Ranch Wildlife Management Area.It was walking parallel to them, in the same direction as they were riding, and along this side of a fence-line about 50 feet away. It never looked at them while they were looking at it and did not alter its steady, direct and \"casual\" pace, neither hesitating or running, and \"acted like it knew what it was doing and where it was going\" until it disappeared into the nearest cover of trees. The upright posture during its stride was also described as very stiff or rigid while moving smoothly.The figure was described as at least 7 to maybe 8 feet tall, evenly dark-colored, fairly broad but \"not overly huge\", with long \"bangs\" and hair on its head, with its \"blocky\" head down and leaning forward slightly.The father estimated that it may have been in their sight for perhaps as long as 7-10 seconds while it covered about 100 feet in distance.While dusk was approaching, there was still ample daylight, they could see well and have no doubt as to what they saw.They continued camping in the area for a few more days, until the job was finished, but saw nor heard anything else unusual.David Petti",
