My family was up in the eastern Sierras, near Mono Lake, approx 13-15 miles above Conway Summit in an area known as Virginia Lakes. My dad told my brother and I to go to the lake and gather firewood. It was late in the day and the sun was down but it wasn't dark yet, only dusk. I was 14 yrs old and my brother was 1 month shy of 16. He had his learners permit so we were allowed to take the truck.",

There was no one on the shore at the time, and since it was a fairly large rock, whoever threw it had to have great upper body strength.",

            "Follow-Up Report": " The witness was interviewed by phone on 5/04/08 and provided the following additional details/observations:The witness reported that the animal he viewed was rapidly coming up a graded incline at an angle from behind them, as if to cut off distance to cover more ground. He believes the animal was chasing down its prey which had possibly crossed the road unseen in front of them. The animal he observed was estimated to be 7ft tall, weighing possibly 350lbs. He described it as being very agile and extremely fast, commenting, \"Don't think you are going to out run it\".The animal was viewed from a distance of approximately 20 to 30 feet. Its hair was blackish brown in color. It was muddy, and matted, and had a shaggy, stringy appearance. He compared the hair to a sheepdog or wolf.He noted that when it landed he could clearly see the structure and distinct muscle definition of its legs. The arms were very long and lanky. He reported that what he saw was ape or gorilla-like but was distinctly more upright, with its shoulders back. He was struck by the way the arm rotated over the top of its head in a full 360 degrees as the animal launched itself off, seemingly from its knuckles, at an angle not straight across the road but back at an angle towards them. It then disappeared down the grade on the other side of the road. The length of the sighting is estimated to be 5 - 7 seconds in duration. His girlfriend, who was also a witness, was present at the time of our phone conversation. He consulted with her on multiple questions, also providing feedback about the sighting. He wanted to stop and investigate but his passengers were not in agreement with him, so they continued on. They were in shock at what they had seen and they talked excitedly using \"colorful\" language. He was adamant about what he saw that night, stating that he doesn't care what anyone else believes, he knows what he saw.We talked briefly about other sightings he knew of in the area, people who also had sightings in the county close to him. I found the witness to be very credible.",
