Roosevelt Lake,\" he said. The lake is a reservoir backed up on the Columbia River by the Grand Coulee Dam. \"The left foot track was 17 1/2 inches long,\" Dahinden said. \"The right was 16 1/2 inches. It was twisted, a toe was missing, and there were a couple of bumps along the outside of the foot. A veterinarian said it appears the foot was crushed at one time.\" Dahinden said he plans to use jeeps, boats, an aircraft and tranquilizer guns in his search. He said he expects to find a creature eight feet tall, with a crippled right foot. There have been several reported sightings of the Sasquatch in Washington in recent months, but searches have not confirmed existence of the beast.",
