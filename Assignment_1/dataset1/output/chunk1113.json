            "Observed": "My sighting was back in 1993 we lived in Ferry county Malo Washington state. 2.5 miles up rural area road Empire Creek my driveway turned to the left and you would cross over Empire Creek we lived in a small house that we were building. The time of the sighting was around 6am just light enough to see. The first thing that happened was my two outside dogs were barking at something at the corner where the creek ran through then they came running back to the house with their hair up and wouldn't leave the front porch so I looked to where they stopped and thought that I seen someone standing by a tree. I thought what or who is that, I could see that it was very tall over 8feet and it had dark hair the head was smaller than the shoulders but it had no neck. When we made what I want to say is eye contact it took a step back and got parallel with the tree so I couldn't see him but I knew that he was there. I turned my head for just one second to yell at my husband and looked back and he was gone.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness lived on 40 acres in a home they were building in a ravine, \u0093down in a hole,\u0094 near a creek.  Their property was at the bottom of a steep old logging road.  The area is heavily forested and there are many old logging roads, but the logging operations shut down years before.  The witness was inside their home, which had no curtains on the windows yet.  They had a light dusting of snow during the night and it was just getting light.  Looking out the window, she saw their two dogs running toward the part of the driveway that crosses the creek.  (From Google Earth, the distance was about 150 feet.)  The dogs stopped suddenly, barking at something, and then ran back to the porch.  Her dogs were \u0093freaking out\u0094 and \u0093were acting scared.\u0094 Their hair was standing straight up, so she let them in.She described them as \u0093mountain dogs.\u0094  They lived outside and weren\u0092t afraid of anything.  They often chased wildlife off the property, so their behavior that morning was highly unusual.  She put them back out and they started \u0093barking up a storm.\u0094  From the window, she looked to see what they were barking at and saw a very large \u0093thing,\u0094 that looked like a person, but was too big to be a person.  It was very wide, and \u0093super dark,\u0094 at the edge of the driveway by the creek.As she focused, she could see that it was covered in hair.  She then observed that it was \u0093super big through the shoulders\u0094 and could see the head was right on the shoulders, as if it had no neck.  She didn\u0092t see the eyes, but when she looked at the face, she could tell that it saw her looking at it.  That\u0092s when it stepped behind a tree to hide.  Her husband was in the bathroom and could hear the dogs barking and going crazy.  She briefly turned to yell at her husband, \u0093Get out here, there is something up by the creek!\u0094  When she turned back, it was gone.Later on, she and her husband found foot prints at the sighting location, which were twice the size of her husband\u0092s size 12 boots.  They could see where the toes where spread out in some tracks, as if it had slipped in the mud by the creek.  They found broken branches up high, where it must have grabbed those branches or broken through them.Looking back, the witness wished she had gone out immediately to investigate.  She was frightened, but didn\u0092t feel threatened at that moment.  It was hard to comprehend what she was seeing.  They didn\u0092t have neighbors at that time, so it wasn\u0092t a person, and it was \u0093huge.\u0094  She later read a report, in the local rural monthly magazine, about Bigfoot sightings in the area.  That helped her realize she did see a Bigfoot.After that experience, she questioned other incidents.  Sometime before her sighting, their small dog went missing.  She found it six miles away with a broken back.  It hadn\u0092t been run over and had no other injuries, just a broken back as if it had been \u0093karate chopped.\u0094They built a jungle gym out of logs for their three young kids to play on. They played outside a lot.  Her son reported hearing breaking branches, a number of times, above where they played, so the witness wondered if a Bigfoot was watching her kids play.The family spent time hiking, and collecting gems and crystals, but didn\u0092t have any other encounters.  There have been a number of Bigfoot sightings in the general area, including recent reports of road crossings and a sighting by riders on an ATV.  The witness in this report had an unforgettable experience that day, and feels very fortunate.  ",
