It was about 11:30 at night when I saw it.  I thought it was a germiln or a baby bigfoot.  I didn't want to see it up close because I was too scared.  It was maybe about 3 to 4 feet tall and it was runing with long arms swaying back and forth.  Also it ran like the hunch back of Notre Dame.   Then I ran up stairs until my dad got home.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "     Dealing with younger witnesses is always a touchy job, and such reports are easily ignored.  However, after spending time on the phone with this young man's Mother, I am posting it as a credible sighting.  He was, and remains, quite shaken by this incident.  His Mom and Dad have taken him seriously enough that his Dad explored the area looking for whatever he could find.  The animal ran down the middle of the dirt road in front of their house, but no prints were found - the road is hard packed and frequently traveled.     His Mom looked through the internet with him to try to make sense of what he saw.  The internet search is how they found the BFRO, and, after consideration, they decided to turn in this report.  Of particular interest to me, and key in my decision to post the report, was his description of the animal's movement.   Also, the streetlight on their road illuminated the animal well.       The family has my contact information, and we will be in touch over the next several weeks as we monitor for any additional activity.  The area is rural, and approximately 10 miles from another report I processed 2 years ago.  The general area (20 mile radius) has had a variety of reports known to this researcher that go back 20-25 years.  Follow up information will be posted when warranted. ",
