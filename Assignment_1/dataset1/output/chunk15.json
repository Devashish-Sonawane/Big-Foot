            "Follow-Up Report": "We spoke with the witness around 6 pm about his report on 7/5. His report is very detailed and he is very articulate. There were a few things we discussed that were not detailed in his report.  He told us this happened around 8 pm on the Friday evening, June 23.He described his back yard as a 3 tiered landscape.  His house looks down on the second level from his office window and door. He has a swimming pool on the second level. Beyond the second level there is a third level that runs down by a creek that runs behind his property. This creek is known as Brushy Creek. When he first saw the creature he only saw what he described as a possible head of someone or something walking down by the creek. Because of the 3 levels tiers he could only see the head and no body. He dismissed it but thought it was strange that he could see a head from this angle as any person or thing would have to be very tall for him to see even a head at that angle. Later in the evening he heard the howling as described in his report.  Due to the behavior of his dogs he decided to go outside and check it out. This is when he saw the large creature in the 3rd level which was where the creek runs behind his the property. He saw what he described as greenish-yellow eyes which really creeped him out. The creature was heading north but when the creature saw the witness and his dog he turned and headed back south down the creek. Witness states this happened very quickly and before he even had time to really take in what was happening .  I ask him what he thought the creature was doing. He stated his wife has a compost pile in that area where she puts left over fruit, coffee and egg shells. Also there are a lot of dewberries in that area that are abundant during the spring and summer months. He thinks most likely the creature was eating the berries and maybe eating from the compost pile. The witness stated he did go down around the creek the next morning looking for footprints. He states the ground was very covered with leaves so there were no distinct footprints, but the leaves were very disheveled. They do have owls in this area, but he has also heard something that does not sound like an owl. It is more of a deep, guttural growl.The witness seemed to be credible and honest. He said he questioned himself that maybe one of his friends was pranking him as he is nearing his 50th birthday, but when he thought about it more he just did not think a human could move as gracefully and quickly as this creature did. He estimates the creature to be about 8\u0092 tall and probably twice his weight which is 175 lbs. That would put the creatures estimated weight at about 350 \u0096 400 lbs.We met with witness on July 15, 2017 on location of sighting. Area is heavily populated with a small creek running back of property with wooded area around creek.  Witness throws food scraps over fence around creek area. Sighting was in area of location of food scraps.  Witness seemed believable and recalled many details of the night of sighting.  Family along with neighbors have heard loud noises coming from creek area on occasion.   There were several reports in the local Round Rock media around the time of this reported sighting.  Unfortunately, the reporting is really shoddy, and no article we could find did any kind of investigation.  It sounds like one or more people may have reported sightings, but its difficult to discern any facts from the articles.'Bigfoot crossing' signs go up in Round RockFBI to Round Rock police: Bigfoot is 'most wanted fugitiveIf you do a google search on Bigfoot Round Rock, you\u0092ll find other articles.Just west of the city of Round Rock is the Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge, rich with water and wildlife, including deer and feral hogs.",

            "Observed": "We are Southern California residents who were in Washington scouting for places to move after I retire next year.  We were renting a cabin on Lake St. Claire near the Nisqually Indian Reservation.  One afternoon we decided to take the kayak out. We were on the lake for about an hour, it was dead quiet except the occasional bird or splash from a fish in the lake, when we heard this loud mournful yell that echoed all around us. My wife froze and looked at me and said \"What the hell was that?\"  I was trying to make sense of it and it didn't sound like the howl of a dog. It sounded more human like a mid to upper range of a bass singer holding a long mournful note but more guttural at the end, and LOUD very LOUD. Like I said it echoed all around us so it was impossible to get a fix on direction. I told my wife I really didn't know, to wit she said \"Time to go back\" and we returned to the cabin.  When we got back to the cabin instead of going inside I turned on my phone hoping to catch it on video.  I would let the camera go for a minute then stop and then record for another minute. I hit pay dirt on the third try.  The recording is a little thrown off by the cabin inhabitant next to us trying to start a jetski or boat but it starts immediately after the engine is cut off again. Then one more after shorter one right after. Didn't hear or see anything after the recording it was the last time we heard it. Recording available upon request.",
