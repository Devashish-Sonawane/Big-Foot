            "Observed": "One night while fishing with 2 friends on a creek outside town, it was nearing 11:00 pm. pitch black night. Fish were biting decent. But to pass the boredom my one friend found 2 sticks laying on the bridge.  In a humorous way he started beating them together. To join the fun I made a very odd whoop sound just for giggles. He put the sticks down and we went back to fishing.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness. Before we started he corrected the date for me. It was April of 2017, not August. April 17th to be exact. And the time is approximately 10:30 to 11:15. He found a time/date stamped photo of the nights catch so this time and date is accurate.Story is very much like his initial entry. They had watched some reruns of Finding Bigfoot, and thought they would \"make a little noise\" just to see if they get stir something up. (Please see maps attached for witnesses assessment of the creature moving towards them)They were fishing from the bridge from their favorite spot. There were 2 lanterns they had for light since it was pitch black.They made the first knock around 10:30 and witness made his \"whoop\" call immediately afterwards. About 5 minutes later they got the return call. They did this 2-3 more times and each time the call was returned and got closer to them. They were also getting a bit more spooked as well, but not spooked enough to cease the calls. The thought that maybe someone was pranking them was still in the back of their minds, but fading.  The witness deduced, from numerous years of fishing and hunting the area, that the creature started on or near, a large sandbar in the river (\"creature started here\" pin on map). It could have course, been in the woods near the bank. There are usually a lot of game tracks on the sand bar, so the assumption is well founded. There is another sand bar on the curve, slightly north and across the river from his \"starting point\" as well. When they knew the creature was within 100 yards or so, and getting closer, they knew \"something was not right\".At this point is when they decided to pack up their gear and load up the truck, toss the carp back in the creek, and wait while they decided when it was time to \"get the hell outta there\".When I asked about the location where he thought the creature started, witness pointed out that the creature was getting louder because it was moving towards them, not because it was simply raising it's \"voice\". I asked him that specific question and he was quick to respond it was moving in on them.  Witness and his friends know this area extremely well and they were all in agreement about where the creature was when it had first replied. They all also agreed it was moving in on them. As they trained the high beam light on the only opening they could see, they heard it moving through the woods. The following is the specific description of activity and sighting: As it walked along, or in, the ditch by the creek, he described the footfall as like \" a hunter walking through the woods with purpose and taking a known route\". There were no pauses or interruptions in its gait. They were following its path \"with their ears\" as hunters would. When they saw it, it appeared from a level area of brush. They saw the top of the head. It was \" shaped like a baseball cap without the bill on it, rounded, not conical \" It was \"whitish/grey\" with an even mixture of both colors. Estimate of distance at sighting to be in the 30-40 yard range, possibly a bit closer.The sighting was 1-2 seconds. From the gait, it appeared to have stepped ON the log they saw the next day, rather than over it. Otherwise it may not have been visible if it merely stepped over it. It was a minimum of 7 ft and probably taller, by estimate only. They did \"tear ass outta there\" as mentioned and went home to collect their thoughts. They did return with weapons to see if there was anything but it was dead quiet.Witness's conversation with me was accurate as far as his initial report was. The event was very near the Neosho River on a small tributary creek. Locally, the river is called Circle Lake, because of the very numerous curves in the river. There have been 2 other reports filed by this investigator over the past few years, of \"white or white/light grey creatures\" in an area near Pratt and or Wichita Kansas. ",

This area is southeast of the intersection of Packard and Carpenter Roads in Pittsfield Township. It was during this trek into the wilderness that I firmly believe that I encountered a Sasquatch, or family of them.

His family's encounter in 1974 is very well written out in his report and not much detail can be added to that account.  However, he did add that the initial tree twists/breaks found near the 'fort' occurred about 3 meters high, and \"what was amazing is that the trees made an interesting formation, much like an \u0093X\u0094 style tripod with the largest tree bent horizontally over the upper point of the X.\"The occurrence with his parents and his dog is similar to some other encounters involving sasquatch - tree breaks being heard upon entering a specific area, being paralelled by something while going in and out of an area, very powerful odors, and the family pet acting strangely, often with fear.Usually this activity ends at the same place where it began; in this case, it was the clearing at the edge of the forest.  His father was very reluctant to enter forested areas after this encounter, and would only do so with his dog. The 2001 encounter is a 'class A' encounter, and is reported in Report #2953.",
