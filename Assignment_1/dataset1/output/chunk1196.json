We traveled to the scene of the sighting, at the top of Buckhollow Rd. and the intersection of an unnamed logging road, just south of Swift Creek Rd., north of the town of Beaver.On a summer day in 2013 or 2014, the witness and his dog were driving on back roads. It was sunny and about 80 degrees at 2:00 \u0096 3:00 p.m. He had parked his car and walked to the top of the hill. He was looking down the gravel road ahead of him. He was standing at a vantage point of 20 - 25 feet higher than the subject and about 55 yards away. At first, he didn\u0092t recognize the creature  and assumed the form was a decaying tree at the side of the road. He was actually looking past it, on down the road. The witness started to turn to his right when he caught movement out of the corner of his eye. When he turned his eyes back on the subject, he noticed that it had turned to its left. It took 2 or 3 steps and disappeared into the treeline. The witness saw the creature from the side and described it as about 7-foot-tall and weighing about 800 \u0096 900 lbs. Its hair was gray, about the color of burned charcoal and was very matted and clumped together. He said it was perfectly camouflaged and that was why he thought it was a decaying tree. The body was very thick with \u0093huge, super thick\u0094 thighs, butt and chest. Its arms hung to about its knees. From the knees down was covered by the tall grass and weeds in which it was standing. He was unable to get a good look at its face. The witness described the strides as being very fluid, almost like someone riding an escalator. Even though it was walking, its upper body didn\u0092t dip or bob. The reporter didn\u0092t notice any odor.The area was heavily wooded, with hills and small creeks and ponds. Wildlife is abundant as I saw deer tracks and coyote scat. The area was also infested with ticks. I didn\u0092t notice any apparent bigfoot tracks or other evidence in the immediate area.The trees have been trimmed, the weeds cut and the road widened since the sighting. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I made contact with this witness, a Reno police officer, on the afternoon of December 21, 2007. We went over his report. He couldn\u0092t add much more to what he and his friends saw on Boundary Peak Mountain. He has bought property close to where this all took place, but a little further down the mountain. The reason he mentioned the property is because something unusual happened there (long after the sighting described above), which may be connected: After he cleared a pad for his 5th wheel camper on his 10 acre plot, he and his dog were burning off the brush and weeds the following night and had a pretty good sized fire going. His dog started to look out into the darkness and began to bark and growl at something. He only had a strong spot light to look around with, but he didn\u0092t see anything. He was a non-believer about the Sasquatch phenomenon before this sighting. He is now a 100%\u0092er, and he is going to do more investigating in and around his new property.As mentioned in his report, there were two friends with the witness as they were hiking/climbing up towards Boundary Peak. They spotted the figure as the group stopped and were waiting for two other climbers that were on their way down the trail. The trail was narrow at this point. As the two groups were passing on the trail this creature decided to start moving across this mountainous bowl area. According to the wit, all five of the mountain climbers observed this movement.  The witness said that he first saw the figure about 200yards below them and about 300 yards out in front of their position on the trail. They were somewhere above the 12000 ft level on the mountain. He thought he first heard a rock falling, which might have startled this figure, because it began to move in the opposite direction from the climber who dislodged the rock. That climber was on his way down but he was even higher up on that mountain trail than the witness his friends.The witness was very impressed by how fast this creature was moving in this loose shale that was on the surface of this very steep slope that was part of a large bowl area. If this had been a human, it would have taken one step forward and two steps back. Total viewing time was approximately two minutes or a little less, before it disappeared into the vegetation on the other side of that large bowl area. When this figure came to some larger boulders or rocks that were in its path it went down on all fours and climbed up and over these boulders and then continued on, on all fours, for a short distance. Then it went back up on two legs, still moving relatively fast. The witness thinks the figure didn\u0092t ever see his group of hikers.The figure had longer hair on the head than the rest of the body. It was also darker hair on the head.  The rest of the body hair was light brown except for the crotch area, which was darker than the body hair. The witness could not tell if the figure was a male or female, nor estimate its weight. It was too far away. He thought its arms appeared to be longer than an average human's arms.This witness has hunted and taken bear in Idaho and Montana. He knows what bears look like, and what they can and cannot do on their hind feet.  He was certain it was not a bear. He first became aware of the BFRO because of the recent Pennsylvania trail cam photo (the \"Jacobs creature\").  He said, \u0093That also is no bear!\u0094 and he's right.---------------------------------I use to hunt deer on the California side of where this took place back in 1980\u0092s. This mountain range has its own special beauty and loneliness that keeps drawing you back. In certain places you feel like you are on a different planet all together, like the moon. There are bristlecone pine trees in this area. One of those bristlecone pine trees is the oldest known living thing on the planet. It is 4000+ years old. I have a picture of it. At one time it was marked, so people could find it and photograph it. Now the Forest Service has wisely changed the trail and removed the sign to protect it. This witness is a highly reliable and believable. It seems he saw a sasquatch, but what was it doing at that elevation?  Deer cross over those mountains, using those high mountains passes. So it may have been following their path.---------------I spoke with one of the witnesses friends by phone on January 10, 2008 -- one of the friends who was with him when the incident happened. He confirmed corroborated the story, but he couldn\u0092t say just what it was. He said it was covered with hair and was moving very fast in lose shale headed down and away from them. He saw it moving for a little over a hundred yards.The following photos were taken about twenty years ago by me, a few miles south of Boundary Peak Mountain. Most of the high peaks in this mountain range are on the  California side. Some are over 14,000 feet. Montgomery Peak is over 13,400 feet and lies just on the California side of Boundary Peak Mountain.  These two mountain peaks are connected by a high ridge/saddle that intersects the state line. The first photo looks north and was taken from a 12,500 ridge that we had to traverse to enter our deer hunting area. It shows Montgomery Peak. Boundary Peak is located behind and next to this mountain.The second photo shows me standing next to the 4000+ year old bristlecone pine. We had to go through this grove of bristlecone pines on the way to our deer hunting area.The third photo is another grove of bristlecone pines trees a little further north of our old deer hunting area.The last photo shows the deer hunting area that slopes off into Nevada.",
