            "Follow-Up Report": "Two young men were hunting coyotes SE of Tower, Michigan when they came upon tracks in the snow with strides of five to six feet between each print.  A total of about three to four dozen tracks were seen. The witness\u0092 tracks are seen along side the unknown tracks in the following photos.  He wears a size twelve boot and the tracks were fourteen to fifteen inches long, six to seven inches wide. There was a light, fluffy snow that fell early in the morning and the witness believes the tracks were made the previous night,  sometime before the new snowfall.  January was a weird month for us as far as snow goes.  We had a lot of snow and then it melted - and then we had a lot more fall. The snow that the tracks were made in was a heavier, wetter snow than the \"fluff \" that fell early in the morning on this day. Thus, in my experience, the way the snow is covering the prints does not look unusual to me at all.  When I asked the witness if he thought the tracks could have been made by any other kind of animal he responded with the thought that they could have been made by a running deer or elk because of the length of the stride (5 -6 ft), but then he saw the outline of the toes.  Its the toes that is causing him trouble....He didn't really believe bigfoots were real before, but now he has no explanation for the toes. Also, the tracks were coming from the local Pigeon River nature preserve which is a protected area for elk. This area is prime Bigfoot habitat, miles and miles of dense forests, lakes and rivers.Both men were taken off guard and became frightened at the thought that there actually could be something so large in the area.  They left shortly after coming upon the tracks and the witness said, \"I've been in the woods my whole life and never seen anything like that!  I've seen and hunted bear and I've seen cougar in the wild, but I have never been so afraid!\"  This experience caught the witness off guard and he said he still gets goose bumps when he thinks about the tracks he found that day. I could hear a quiver in his voice and he explained that talking about it brings the fear back up. He described it as \"tremendous fear\". ",
