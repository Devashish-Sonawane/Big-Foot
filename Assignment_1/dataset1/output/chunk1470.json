            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness on October 10, 2006. He talked freely about his incidents over a ten year period. Many of his experiences took place not far from Morgantown, WV -- a large northern town in West Virginia. He has hunted since the age of 8 and is now 42, and spends a significant amount of time in the woods hunting and scouting for game. He has never told anyone about his unusual incidents.The place where he squirrel hunted was a location where being followed and feeling uneasy happened nearly every fall. On two separate occasions something large followed him along a railroad grade, one moving through rhododendron bushes with ease. He could see the wake of what was trailing him but without making much noise.  The second was from the up hill side of the tracks. There he experienced an intimidation display of limb breaking and sounds of something moving back and forth, seeming to make their presence known.  He believes his residence (a mobile home) has been slapped on several occasions with great force. It has been loud enough to waken him. On one occasion, he was awake between 2 and 3 in the morning during the summer. He observed three silhouettes walk past his window on one occasion. The next morning he walked outside the residence to determine their approximate height. He is 6-1 and his head was below the level of the window.  He estimated the height of the three as 8+ feet, 7.5 feet and 6-8. Once in Upsher County near Buckhannon, he found a pile of dead deer. The animals had been stacked, all having their necks and legs broken. He stated they may have had their backs broken also. He stated the carcases had been opened along the stomach.",

These are cousins of my brothers friend, I befriended all the cousins.  So there were 8 of us in my car.  We were almost to their house, came around the S curves on Holmes Road/D High way.  We were just about to get onto the dirt road and a bigfoot passed right in front of us heading into the cemetery just off the paved road.  All eight of us seen the creature, a little freaked out and high tailed it to their house.  I took another road to get home!!",
