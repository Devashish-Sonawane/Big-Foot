            "Follow-Up Report": "After conversing at length with the witness, the following information can be added to his report:While following the Big Schloss circuit hike in the George Washington National Forest, the witness and his hiking partners camped at Sugar Knob cabin, a small stone structure maintained by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club. The cabin is located very near the Virginia/West Virginia State line, approximately 10 miles north west of Woodstock, Virginia. The area around the cabin is densely vegetated with mountain laurel, oak and pine, making it difficult to see a great distance into the forest.Before sunset the party built a fire in the ring outside the cabin and began to hear loud, clear sounds of movement in the forest around them. As they listened to the sounds, they became convinced they were bipedal and from something large. Expecting a hunter, they called out, but received no response. Eventually they moved into the cabin and secured the door, increasingly concerned over the noises that continued to come from outside.The sound of movement continued off and on for nearly three hours, coming closer to the cabin. And from inside the cabin, a small but sturdy structure of cement and local stone, the trio could clearly hear foot steps moving, and then stopping, and eventually moving on again. They grew increasingly \"freaked out\" when the footsteps finally circled around behind the cabin and stopped just outside a small shuttered window.By now a layer of snow and ice had blanketed the area and outside visibility was noticeable better, despite being well after sundown. When the witness opened the shutters they were startled to see a \"large, hairy face with large eyes\" just outside and staring in at them. The witness could tell this was a large creature that was bending down to look in the window. But his attention was mostly drawn to a dull red shine in the creature's eyes and the immensity of its head. The witness described an immediate sense of panic at what he was seeing and knew the creature could easily enter the cabin if it wished.After 3 to 4 tense seconds of staring through the window at each other, the creature turned away and move off quickly. The witnesses were all shocked by the encounter and relieved that the creature did not move to harm them. They remained awake the rest of the night, however no other sounds were heard. In the morning they quickly departed and made their way down an icy path to their vehicles at the trail head.The witness has since moved to Alaska and lost touch with his hiking partners, so their perspectives on the event are not available for this report. However, as noted by the witness, anecdotal information of other encounters were recorded in the cabin's visitor log, and the BFRO is investigating reports from other witnesses within short distances of this location.No one has tried to look at and confirm the cabin's visitor log, both time and distance are big factors. This took place so long ago that the log may no longer be there. Since speaking with this witness, BFRO investigators are attempting to locate and review the visitor's log referenced by the witness in this report.  If it reveals any relevant information then this report will be updated.  If you have any information regarding this cabin and/or its visitor log, please contact the BFRO at contact@bfro.net",

We did not stay long in the grove. On the hillside, we also found large scuff marks in the ground (too hard for footprints), but decided that it wasn't any kind of REAL evidence.",
