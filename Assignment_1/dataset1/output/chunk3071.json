            "Follow-Up Report": "On this early morning, the witness observed the silhouette of a creature approximately seven feet tall.  The creature passed within fifteen feet of the witness. Lighting would have come from the moon that was nearly full as well as the porch-light from the main dwelling.  That porch light would have been behind the creature and approximately 100 to 120 feet away.  The trail along which it walked had a dense tree cover and heads into a swamp.  There would have been few leaves present at that time, however.As witnessed, the creature's arms were proportionally longer than that of a human.  The creature also seemed to have no neck.  The silhouette was that of a tall, lanky creature.  No facial features were ever observed.The creature was observed for thirty seconds as it walked along a trail and disappeared into a swamp.  The gait exhibited by the creature was an odd, side-to-side movement.  The creature was hunched forward as it walked.  He seemed to think that the method of movement indicated that the feet might be pointed out from, rather than parallel to the direction of travel. The creature remained upright for the length of the encounter.The witness believed that the creature was attempting to walk in such a manner as to avoid making sound.  The witness detected no sound as the creature walked by.After having spoken at length with the witness, I find the witness to be truthful, cooperative, and credible.",
