            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was forthcoming and certain of what was seen. He has only told a few people.The witness repeated several times that what he saw was not a deer, a cow, or a bear. He did not travel this road again, a shortcut off the main highway, for several years. To this day, he will not travel that road at night.Several more details can be added to the report:-The sighting lasted about 20-30 seconds after the figure stood in the road.-Deer were abundant so he was scanning the sides of the road as he drove, looking for eye-shine from deer in case one ran out in front of his car.-He saw what he thought was a trash bag or stump in the creek that runs parallel to the road. When he came closer, he was unsure of what was there - a cow? what? Prior to slamming on the brakes, he saw a figure on the side of the road with a hunched back, like someone with bad posture. When he got beside it, the figure stood. -He was driving a '68 Camaro and the figure was about even with the height of his car, while still in the creek.-With the figure being observed in the rear-view mirror, it walked out of the creek and into the road.-The figure was about 6 1/2 -7' ft tall and wide at the shoulders and upper body. He guessed between 3-4 ft, probably closer to 3ft. The neck was not visible like a human's.- He threw the car into reverse and then drive, squealing his tires as he sped off. It went in the direction of the creek & woods, not seeing if it walked or ran.-The area of the sighting is a shortcut off the main road with the nearest home about 5 miles away.There are homes on the road, but not near the sighting area.The road is (or was at the time) a small blacktop road with no lane dividers/ stripes, etc. on the surface.There are woods on both sides of the road for miles.",

            "Observed": "It was August of 1977 and I had missed my ride home from Hacketstown NJ to Byram NJ. The road to get back to Byram is Waterloo Rd. It was about 9:30-10:00 PM so I decided to hitch hike it on Waterloo hoping that someone would give me a lift back to HWY-206. It was very dark and as I was walking past Stephens State Park and then the old Saxton Falls area, I could hear something that sounded like it was on 2 feet stalking me in the woods on the ridge side of Waterloo Rd. It got very interesting when I started sprinting, it also started sprinting keeping up with me for what seemed like at least a mile. When I would walk, it would walk. It was loud as it went thru the woods as I stayed on the road hoping for a car to pick me up. Eventually I did get a ride near a few houses after passing an old Tavern on the river side of Waterloo Rd.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness over the phone. The witness was unable to meet at the location of the encounter because he lives out of state. I am very familiar with this portion of New Jersey and I frequently travel on the road the incident took place. The following details can be added.-- The witness stated that he didn\u0092t think it was a bear or deer that was pacing him. He described hearing a heavy, thumping sound, like bipedal foot falls, from approximately 30-50 yards into the western portion of the wooded area on Waterloo Road. Although some bears such as grizzly and brown bear will track humans, there are no such bears in New Jersey, only black bears, which are not usually known to follow humans. -- The witness used Google Maps to pinpoint the spot where the encounter began. Interestingly enough, a utility company transmission right-of-way crosses the road at the location. Bigfoots are known to use right-of-ways as thoroughfares. Bigfoots are also known to intimidate humans as a defense mechanism, which in this case would be stalking or paralleling.-- From where the incident began, to where the witness was finally picked up, the western portion of Waterloo Road has no houses or side streets, which would mean the biped would have been running at high speed through constant woods. -- At the time of the incident, the witness was a college athlete and in great shape. Although at times the witness was running at full speed on a paved roadway, the stalker in question kept pace with him.-- The location of the incident is surrounded to the west by Allamuchy State Park, which is 9,000 acres of thick woods and to the east by the Musconetcong River.-- The witness had no visual sighting but experienced a tremendous amount of fear and anxiety.-- The location of this incident is right where Sussex, Morris and Warren counties intersect.-- A future visit to the site by me is planned",
