I was running late and got behind a guy towing a boat and he was going well below the speed limit so I took the first opportunity to pass him. He sped up causing me to have to speed up to pass and as soon as I got around him a state trooper came over the hill and I was flying, about 85 mph.  I knew I was in the wrong but the hwy takes a right turn and there is a county road to the left (cr 1579).  I turned there really quickly before the trooper was able to see me and he flew past the turn off and missed me.",

            "Observed": "I had the ecnounter while in college in Ashland Wisconson in 1978. While bowhunting with a friend deep in the woods I took to sitting high in a tree overlooking thick briars. Out of the still and silence of the woods an animal came barreling through the thickest vegetation imaginable. It was thrashing about and shrieking at the highest pitch possible. I was frithened to death and could only stand to try to see it. I could not see it but did see the brush being shaken. Again the shrill sound of its voice filled the air. It was awesome to hear, scary but awesome. My friend who was hunting down from me did see it and it was on two legs and appeared apelike to him. We were too afraid to stick around and never went back. We went to an environmental college and I shared this with one of the professors Dr. V. He never heard of a local animal making that sound. That is my story and I tell it a dozen times a year. Good luck in your research!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking to the witness on the phone, he told me that he had long since lost contact with his hunting friend. This would have been useful as a corroborating witness. He also couldn't recall the location of the incident and his description could be any number of areas. That being said, his recounting of the incident is still very vivid in his mind. After all this time, the witness cannot explain the sounds he heard that October.",
