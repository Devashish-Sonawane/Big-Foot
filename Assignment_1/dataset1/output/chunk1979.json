            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke at length with the witness by phone.  He was able to clearly describe the incident and the surrounding terrain and other incidentals.  While Staunton State Park is a very heavily utilized area, with hundreds of visitors during the time that this encounter happened, the area that the witness and his girlfriend were located was in the far reaches of the park, close to the boundary with the Mount Evans Wilderness Area, and close to an area with a couple of Class A sightings including Report #45666 and Report #7225, and within 3 miles of a winter track-line that I witnessed personally.I am planning to return to the exact location with the witness sometime in January to map the location and terrain in detail.  I am very familiar with the Mt. Evans Wilderness and Arapahoe Forest area adjacent to the park, and will be spending time this winter snowshoeing the area.This incident is obviously interesting because of the combination of sounds that were witnessed.  The first vocalization - the cough/bark, is a commonly described sound that could be made by anything from a black bear to a moose, elk or other ungulate.  But, none of these animals would also emit a whooping sound immediately after, and rock clacking sounds were heard as well by the witnesses girlfriend.In my opinion, this incident may represent a warning to other Sasquatches in the area that the mountain biker was approaching.
