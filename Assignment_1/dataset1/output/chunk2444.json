As we walked down the trails through the woods I occationally heard the sounds of twigs and branches breaking as if somthing was moving through the trees and bushes about 10-15 feet off the side of the trail. I became greatly alarmed because whatever was creating the disturbance had been following us for quite a distance",

The sighting is near the Muckleshoot Reservation, which could provide a safe refuge for the animal. Although this incident was near a populated city, the White River drainage is historically well known for sasquatch type animal activity, especially as it moves past Grass Mountain and Greenwood.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness during a telephone interview and the following information can be included. The witness was with a group of people in an area that was once a public campground.  At the time of her report, the campground had been abandoned and was closed to the general public.  Prior to the encounter, the group had been walking along a path that led to various camp sites.  The path was paralleled by thick tree and brush growth.  The witness recalled that all along the path, it sounded like something was being thrown at them.  She remembered the noise was made by something striking the trees and leaves which led her to believe it was rocks being thrown at her group.  The witness also told me the she and her husband returned the next day to search the area in the daylight and according to the witness, they found the large rock that had been thrown at them and it was so large, that her husband was unable to move it.  Her husband, who is an avid hunter, attempted to back track from the area of the large rock.  He discovered a path of small saplings that had been trampled and branches broken off of trees that led away from the encounter.  At the first opportunity, the witness agreed to meet with me and show me the area.I met with the witness and her husband at the campground where the incident occurred.  As it had been over two years since her encounter, numerous changes to the area were evident.  All of the buildings had been torn down and most of the campsites had been removed.  Nature had begun the process of reclaiming the area including the trails and roads.  With the witness\u0092 assistance, we were able to find the general area of her encounter, but unable to locate the large rock.  During our search of the area, I did discover numerous deer beds, wild berry bushes and the skeletal remains of a deer.  With ample water available from the reservoir, heavy wooded areas, and plenty of resources available, it is very possible that a Sasquatch could be attracted to this area. I've included photographs of the path and area of the encounter as well as pictures of the immediate area.",
