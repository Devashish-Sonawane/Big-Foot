            "Follow-Up Report": "Primary BFRO Investigator--Dave SidotiI received many E-mails from Mrs. C on 10/29-11/2/00 of this incident. The husband and wife have had a few encounters with this creature in the past and Mrs. C said that her husband had seen one back in the late 70's in south Miami. The last report they had was in 1996 & 99 and those reports are on the BFRO's data base. I went out to investigate today (11/3/00) and walked the area with Mrs. C. They had this get-together bar-b-que and there were 12 people at this, including Mr. & Mrs. C. All adults no kids. Adults range from 30's to 40's. I talked to D. which is one of the witnesses that was at the bar-b-que. D. is a realtor in the area.  I asked her to tell me what she heard that night and she said \"I had never heard anything like it before. It was loud and insane. It sounded like it was walking on two feet and it was heavy.\"As I looked around, the area has a lot of oak tress with 4-5\"of brush. They could hear the sounds of foot steps very well because of the oak leaves and dead branches laying around in the woods. (As I walked around I found it hard to keep going in my sneakers because of the stickers grabbing my shoelaces, so when I got a chance to get back to my truck I changed into by work boots.) The sounds started around 10:00pm. Mrs. C then had gotten the tape recorder and got some sounds that it was making. I listen to the sounds that she had recorded and there does seem to be something in the back-ground making a loud scream or screeching sound. But all the witnesses agreed that the tape doesn't compare to the actual sound, as if you were right there listening to it. It was hard to make out over the dogs barking on the tape. Mrs. C said she would give me a copy of the tapes that she has of it.We walked the area where she found what looked to be a foot print, and I took pictures of this print. They seemed small compared to what everyone said that they heard walking in the woods. I was comparing the print (which looks like a small child's foot but couldn't see any toes. The print was about 6-7 inches long and about 1 1/2\" deep but inconclusive as to a foot print.) to what everyone said about the sound. They said the sound was like someone heavy walking on two feet. So this print and the heaviness of the sound don't match. Next, I found a tall young tree that looked to be pulled down and made to stay and another tree that was laid flat (all still had green leaves on them) as to look like a covering or nest. About 2-3'  in front of this is what I found to be a stick formation. At first I thought the sticks had fallen like that, but as I looked closer they looked to be put like that on purpose. As we walked where she said they heard it walking away to the south of them, I found a tree that was still green and broke about 4' off the ground and twisted. Mrs. C told me her and D. found another tree like that and took pictures of it but the one I found was a different one then they had found. Mrs. C called another witness up at work (C.) to have him tell me what he heard that night. C. told me that what he heard \"was something walking in the woods on two feet but heavy like. Also sounded like it was killing something by the sound it made. Something strong and heavy walking through the woods\".",

I stood there a moment longer enjoying the peace when I heard a sound like an air raid siren. It stretched for 3 or 4 seconds and was followed immediately by 3 whoops.  My dog and I were both staring quietly for about 10 minutes and heard nothing else.  After hearing the sound I used my flashlight to search 180 degrees in the direction of the sound.  My dog was with me, he has a strong prey drive though he obeys very well, he heard it and did not move a muscle only stared in the exact direction that the sound came from.  This animal was within 70 feet of me so it was clear and fairly loud (as loud as an amplified siren we use at work).  I went up the following week to look for footprints but I believe it had rained too hard, I did find some but they were too skinny and only about 13 inches long.  I'm not a believer but am very intrigued as the only thing it sounds like is one of the sounds on your site.  Note most of the sounds on your site I find hard to believe.  Maybe someone can help me eliminate bigfoot from the possible list.",
