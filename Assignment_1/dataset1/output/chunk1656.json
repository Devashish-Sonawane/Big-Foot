She is a lifelong resident of Branson and has been to the Henning Conservation area since her experience.  Her testimony relayed the following in detail:... The animal observed was 7-8ft tall, dark shiny straight long hair, extremely large in the shoulders, 3-4ft across the chest, heavy legs, very long arms and small flat head and short neck......The second animal to the right of the larger one was about 2 ft shorter, dark shiny straight long hair, small chest, waist and legs......After shouting at the animals the larger one led the smaller away from the area toward the fire tower lookout area.  .....Both animals, with the larger in lead, went crashing through the tree line, making their escape, south of the parking area......There was no vocalizations heard from the animals.......Witness was adamant about the location, on the second tier winding trail to the Lookout /Fire Watch tower.   The animals were silhouetted against the Branson skyline and city lights.......Witness did not find any credible evidence other than broken saplings caused by the escape of the animals.",

            "Observed": "I was living with my daughter and son-in-law while my new home was being built. They live just down the road from me. A friend of mine had asked me to drive her to Montana at that time, so we left and I was gone for at least a week.  When I returned, it was around 11:00 at night somewhere around the first part of October 2000. I parked my truck down next to the barn area and walked up towards the house.  Off to my immediate right I heard this hair raising guttural growl.  My mind was racing...was this one of my nephews bull cows, or was it a deer, but none of those fit anything like that sound. I thought my feet would never get me to the door of the house. This sound was done once again. I finally went in and told my family what I had heard. My son-in-law insisted that it must have been a bear. I have hunted all of my life and know all of the animal sounds, including a bear. The next morning I called the Conservation office, and they put a gentleman on the phone and I related to him what had happened. I even made a similance of the sound the best I could. He said that he and his wife go to Alaska all the time to study bear and he had never heard anything like that and it definitely wasn't a bear.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. She noted that it was hard to judge how long a vocalization lasted, due to the excitement at the time. On each occasion there was only one such vocalization, which increased in volume as it continued. None of the recordings currently on the BFRO website are similar to the sound she heard. I will try to contact both her son and his friend and file their sighting as a separate report",
