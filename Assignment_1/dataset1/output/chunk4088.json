            "Observed.1  ": "We have the tale of the Pink Lady who supposedly haunts 5-South at the hospital. There are many tales about the former Norwood. Many ghost stories abound in the Marshfield area, but more intriguing to me are two stories of creatures in north Wood County. In the town of Cameron, just southeast of the intersection of highways A and 13/10 (think just south of Schalow\u0092s Nursery) there is reputed to be a clan of pig people, half pig-half human. While this is something touched on in an episode of \u0093The X-Files\u0094 and a couple other old TV shows, and even featured in a 2009 movie called (not surprisingly) \u0093The Pig People,\u0094 I would tend to doubt the assertions of the existence of this mysterious clan, except for the absolute proof provided in the book \u0093Strange Wisconsin.\u0094 It seems at least one of these creatures left hoof prints in black paint right in front of St. Vincent de Paul on Central in Marshfield. I have no idea how the hooves got covered in black paint, or what the pig person was doing in town, but I saw the photo in the book, and I am pretty certain this proves the story! According to \u0093Weird Wisconsin\u0094 and Wisconsinosity.com, on Highway A near Bethel, a few years ago a woman was carried to safety by Bigfoot! That\u0092s right, a sasquatch right here in Wood County! Why, I was as shocked as you are, but I think I can solve the mystery of where that Bigfoot may have originated. According to another legend, at the Smokey Hill Mounds in Auburndale, American Indians living there a century ago feared meeting this creature in the dark. Although I find references to a Smokey Hill Farm and Smokey Hill Road, I can find no Smokey Hill Mounds in the Auburndale area, although it is said it was a former 60-acre island that a band of Indians frequented to trap. They would not remain after dark however, for fear of encountering the \u0093white deer\u0094 or the \u0093hairy man.\u0094 (Page 2 of 2) I can see them being afraid of an albino deer, thinking it perhaps a spirit, especially since it was known that the mounds were in fact burial mounds, but what was that hairy man? It could only have been Bigfoot! Why, for him to travel from Auburndale to Bethel would just be a short sprint! The bigger question in my mind, however, is if Bigfoot has to carry you to safety, what did you encounter from which you needed to be rescued? The only thing I can figure is that maybe it was one of those pig people from Cameron. That would be truly scary.
