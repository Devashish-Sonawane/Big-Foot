            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness on 11/15/15 in the evening. On November 11th, 2015 at approximately 11:00PM, he was returning home from his job at near Tacoma. His route takes him north on Hwy 16 to Purdy, where he takes Hwy 302 west to Key Peninsula Highway, where he turns south for his home. As he was traveling south on Key Peninsula Highway, he was traveling through a wooded area when he saw in his headlights, an upright standing, two legged creature on the right side of the road. The creature turned and walked into the forest, and out of sight. It walked like a human. He described it as a large \u0093person\u0094. He estimated it to be 7-8 feet tall. He said that there are old-growth fir trees which were very large there, and he compared it to one of these trees. He said that its width was about half the size of one of the tree trunks. He described it as being a smoky-gray color all over its body. It had hair covering its whole body. He estimated that he could see it for possibly 10 seconds. He said that it was 25-30 feet in front of his vehicle. That stretch of highway all looks the same, wooded on both sides. It was difficult to establish a precise location. He turned the phone over to his wife. Knowing where he should be on a regular night traveling home at that time of day, she was able to give me a more precise location. It was just north of Key Center a couple of miles. I will use that as the location. It should be noted that this area could have a sasquatch anywhere along this road. I have not had an opportunity to go to the site. This would not be productive, as we have only a general location. I will take an opportunity to go visit the general area on a day trip sometime in the near future.",

We were driving down the road on our way to McPherson bridge, an old condemned bridge that crosses Shoal Creek. We saw what we or I at first thought was a deer or something about 50 yards off the road but about 100 yards in front of us. It started running away from us at a 90 degree angle and was fast but when it got about 200 yards it stood up and ran on two legs and you could its arms swinging real long arms. I guess it had to be at least 7 feet tall. It was about the same color as a white-tailed deer in the summer-time, light reddish brown. It ran to the woods about 500 yards away and turned 90 degrees and started walking.",
