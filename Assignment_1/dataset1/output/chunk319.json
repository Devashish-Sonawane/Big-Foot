I had just got back from a 9 hour drive from florida and I was sitting on the couch with my uncle watching the end of the bears packers game. My sons mother called and I was talking to her when i heard a sound at the window. The only way to discribe it is a hooting sound something like a monkey. Since the lights were on in the house I couldnt see outside so I looked over to my uncle to see if he was messing with me. He was looking out the window and thought I made the noise. Then he jumped up and said \"Did you see that\"? I looked over to the window and saw the bush moving outside. He grabed one of his guns we were planning on shooting at midnight and ran outside. Once he got outside he could see more movement at the end of the house and I heard a grunting noise near my sisters window. It sounded like it came from a big animal, sounding something like uhhhh uhhhh. His dog max heard my uncle yelling whos there and ran around to the front where he was. As soon as max got there he stopped barking and whimpered as he backed up to my uncle. The dog wouldnt get near the side of the house. We didn't hear or see anything for a while so went back inside. When we came back out at midnight we heard some noises but they were far off. Except for that, we didnt hear anything else all night.",

Follow it for about 17 miles and you'll hit Foresthill, then go approximately 20 more miles to Historic Marker 8, which is Ford Point and look to your left, there will be a dirt road going up a hill. Follow that for 1/4-1/2 mile and look for a flat area with a rock ring off the right side of the road. The dirt road continues up the hill where it gets very rugged and you need Four wheel drive to continue much farther; it will then pop you up on another dirt road, which, if you go left, will dead end to another flat spot and another \"primitive\"-type camp ground. During this camping trip we went to that higher campground and thought about camping, but changed our minds",

            "Observed": "I was camping with my father and my brother at a little spot that we had \"discovered\" last year and had camped out a few times. We had arrived early in the afternoon, set up camp, I shot a can or two with my pistol, ate dinner, and had settled in for the evening (it was about sunset), and we had heard this fairly high pitched \"moan\" or wail, that continued off and on throughout the evening. It seemed to be coming from up the hill at first, and if I had to guess, within 300 yards. Well, as time went on, we heard  the noise move down the hill and down the side of the mountain, which is extremely hard to traverse. My dad and I kept speculating as to what it was, as he had hunted bear, deer, and elk, and could not place what it was. We thought, from the tone, that it could have been a lost animal, as it had a mournful tone to it. It had a very resonant quality to it, like it was a good sized animal. Anyway, the noise seemed to move along the side of us, and then we would hear it back at its original location rather quickly. I briefly thought that it was a large bird that kept flying back and forth, but it finally dawned on my dad that there was two sounds; they seemed to be calling to each other; that unnerved me, and my father and I went to take a look with our spotlights and me with my pistol and camera (I always carry a little disposable camera in case I see a bear or deer). We walked up the hill, (on the dirt road), maybe 50 yards and saw nothing; when we got back to camp, I jumped in my truck and drove up the hill maybe 3-400 yards and saw nothing; I did not get out of my truck to look around as I was highly agitated (read:pretty dang spooked) I turned around and kept flashing my spotlight down the side of the mountain occasionally and went past camp down the hill on to Foresthill Road and drove up the road a little ways before turning around again and heading to camp. My dad and brother reported that they had heard nothing and it was quiet for awhile. I sat around the fire and watched the tv that my dad had brought with him; my brother was tired and had gone to bed fairly early. Everything seemed fairly quiet until I went to go \"number one\" by a big pine tree across the road and as I was juggling with the belt that was holding my pistol in its holster, I heard that noise behind the tree and it seemed like it was maybe 30 yards down the hill, it startled me, to say the least, and I ran back to the relative safety of the campfire holding up my pants with one hand and my pistol with the other, much to my dads amusement. Needless to say, I did not venture from camp the rest of the night. We continued to hear the noises until we went to bed, around 0330 or so, I remember hearing it around 0345 and yelling to my dad (he slept in the back of his camper, my brother and I in my tent, 15 ft away) \"there it is again!\", but he was sleepy. I finally drifted off to sleep shortly thereafter and no noise was heard again.",
