            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with both the father and daughter. He was concerned about his experience, so much so that night bothers him still. The daughter's take was that it was a long time ago when she saw it, but she still remembers a large reddish haired thing that was big. Perhaps she remembers most the way it changed her father (his perspective of the outdoors). She doesn't remember much after they turned to leave except that it followed them closer than they liked until they were out of the wooded area.    Initially, I wondered how far away the witnesses were before they could see the subject. The distance was approximately 100 yards, but it registered as a person with a coat on or a hooded sweatshirt. The witness told me that he felt it was just a guy and he payed him little attention while jogging until he got closer and it was obvious that, no, this is not  \"just a guy.\"Some of the characteristics observed when it turned to look at the man and the girls on bicycles included the following :- dark eyes sunk into the brow.- a dark face.- little or no hair on the face.- the nose was small and the face did not stick out so there was no snout look to it.-the hands were noticeable and in its bent stance hung to just below the knees.- no neck,  the head, described as somewhat pointed, was in the shoulder muscles which were immense.-guestimated shoulder width was three and a half feet wide to four feet  wide.- the shoulder width was perhaps the most amazing thing about it along with the hair.  When first seen it was thought to be looking at the road and was walking to either side. A truck had just gone by and it seemed to be curious about something in the road, perhaps the tire tracks. This was described by both him and his daughter.Judging from the descriptions and the emotions in reliving the event, it's evident that something very unusual was observed on that evening in l992..
