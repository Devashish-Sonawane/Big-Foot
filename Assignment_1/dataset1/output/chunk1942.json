            "Observed": "I was squirrel hunting on my grandmothers property, that is around 2 1\\2 miles east of Dayton. I had just walked in a clearing, about 14 x 30ft, surrounded by dense foliage. I had a New England single shot 12 gauge with me. I was looking up into the trees for any sign of squirrels when I caught a movement out of the corner of my right eye. I looked down and to the front of me and saw standing about 15ft away a very large creature. It was about 6ft7in to 7ft tall, very broad shouldered, very hairy except the face. The face was devoid of hair. Coal black eyes, wide nose, very long arms and big hands. It was like I had surprised it. We stared at each other for about 10 seconds, when I cocked my 12 gauge. At that time it turned to its right and disappeared. VERY quickly. It was getting to be dusk but I did look for tracks and found none. There was no smell. I hunted at that location quite often and know the surroundings. That day there were no birds, squirrels or any signs of wildlife whatsoever. It started to get darker so I started home.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "In speaking directly to the witness, I got the impression that he was relieved to be able to report his encounter that he experienced as a teen. He informed me that his family had a history of encounters with sasquatches there on his deceased grandmother\u0092s property; the land no longer belongs to the family, but when it did, the witness spent much time there hunting. The witness told me that his grandmother claimed to have seen a bigfoot peering through her bathroom window, which was very high off the ground. The witness\u0092s uncle also had an encounter while mowing grass out by the woods. Apparently, the uncle ran to the house, leaving his \u0093prized-possession\u0094 lawn mower after something just inside the woods screamed at him. The witness was also chased out of the forest by an unseen something that shook limbs and screamed, a few years before he had the close visual encounter. The particular incident described in this report was quite disturbing to the witness, who had hunted there all his life. He described his feeling as one of \u0093shock\u0094 as he came within mere feet of the animal. The witness stated that he is tall, standing at six feet six inches in height, and at the time of his encounter he was that tall or very near that height. The witness remembered having to look up at the animal\u0092s face. The witness said the creature was a very dark color, possibly black, and his encounter lasted perhaps ten seconds at the most. The animal hurriedly turned and \u0093scurried\u0094 off into the thick undergrowth. The witness heard it running off for a few seconds before the sound of running abruptly stopped.  ",
