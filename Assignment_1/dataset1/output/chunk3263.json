            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone. He has been going to his friend's sixty acre ranch since fourth grade. The ranch has a stream and hay fields surrounded by pine forest. A salt block for deer is on the acreage but not near the sighting.He recalled the moon as at least half or more. While the dog was around the corner of the house, he observed for one to two minutes a milky brown figure 100 feet away. It was next to a tree with a long arm holding onto the tree. Due to limited light, he could not see facial features. He described it as burly, eight feet tall, a rounded cone head sloped to shoulders just under three feet wide. It appeared bushy, so he estimated hair length at three inches. His best guess for a weight would be 500 pounds or more. He is unsure, but thought he saw moist exhaled air at one point. The figure then turned and walked very fast with fluid arm swing 150 feet before turning into the trees. It headed north toward another secluded acreage. It was just inside the tree line and the witness saw it pass behind only a couple trees. The dog never barked. The next day the witness looked for tracks but only found imprints in the snow that had been distorted by the wind. He wears a size eleven boot and the imprints were twice the length, two and one half times the boot width. The imprints were two feet and more apart. The nearest neighbor is about one quarter mile away. Two years prior, a neighbor said he saw a big animal walking on two legs.I found the witness very credible. He summed up the encounter by saying, \"it was the longest two minutes of my life.\"  ",

It was the beginning of Spring and we were searching for bait to go fishing.  We parked our bike on the road, which at the time was gravel and traveled very little. We walked down a path that was used by a farmer to get to his pasture were he had cattle grazing. As we walked down the path I felt as though we were being watched. It was an eerie feeling that still haunts me to this day as I recall the incident.",
