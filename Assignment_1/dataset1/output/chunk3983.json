One witness is semi-retired and the other is an officer with a local major fire department.They were all in agreement as to seeing a large anomalous animal on the described hunt.  Each witness described the event from a slightly different perspective but the majority described the animal as being hair covered with arms and legs like a human with the arms being slightly longer.  The running and leaping action of the animal was definetly bipedal in nature. ",
