            "Follow-Up Report": "I have made several trips to this area to follow up on TS's experience. I went to the location which TB described as just below the Lake Hartwell Dam on the South Carolina side of the Georgia/South Carolina state line. This area of the state is sparsely inhabited and there is a good mix of hardwoods and pine forests with rolling hills. The climate is mild. Fish and game are plentiful.  The Savannah River starts at the base of the dam. The road leading to the wildlife landing is a dirt road that goes back into the woods for nearly a mile and empties into a parking area next to the river.  Once I arrived (close to dusk) I checked out the path that TS described and walked along the riverbank looking for signs of activity.  I found a footprint in the mud which appeared to be humanlike, but the footprint was wide and toes excessively large. The solitary print showed that it was made by something heavy by the depth of the print during the drought we were experiencing at the time.  I photographed the print at dusk, and then sent it to other trackers for review.  Some say it was human; others thought it might be a bear.  Right now, I will classify as inconclusive. This print looks very similar to a photograph of a print in the book \"Sasquatch Legend Meets Science\" by Jeff Meldrum.    I followed the trail back to where it meets with a small stream which empties into the river.  It's nearing dark and a thick fog sets in across the forest and the river. I too, hear the sound of something paralleling me along the trail as I work my way back to the parking area.  There is no smells or other sounds except an occasional car crossing over the bridge by the dam.   This area is ripe for activity.  The woods are deep and ridges with rocky crags run right down to the river.  There are small islands in between GA and SC which help to traverse the Savannah River.   TB notifies me later he has heard a story from friends fishing a few miles below this area within a short period of time they hear loud stomping along the riverbank, and then something tosses large objects at them from the bank into the river.  I follow up this sighting as well and it is in a large tract of land leased out to a hunt club.  I gain permission from the hunt club to scout their area and place game cameras out for a week along with an audio recorder.   At this location there have been howls and knocks heard before by the hunting club, but they had not associated it with BF activity.  While scouting around the hunt camp one night, I perform a series of call blasting and immediately receive a response of a whoop, then an owl, followed by dogs barking in the distance.  The hunters were impressed by how quick the response was to my knocks and commented that they had never heard a sound like this in their hunting careers. During this past hunting season, reports of wood knocking from the area continued. I have refrained from returning to this area until hunting season ended. I plan to follow up on tracking and mapping this region of South Carolina.   ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I phone interviewed the witness who submitted the report and separately phone interviewed the homeowner (witness\u0092s cousin) on whose property the snow track occurred.  A follow-up site interview 8 weeks after the incident was conducted with the witness on the homeowner\u0092s property, as well as a daytime scouting of a nearby watershed.  Below is additional information collected from the phone and site interviews and investigation of the watershed.The incident occurred in a residential cul-de-sac neighborhood.  The homeowner reported that is had snowed approximately 36 hours earlier (Friday night) and on Saturday evening he went out on his back deck at approximately 11:30 pm. He stated that  the family\u0092s 3 cats that typically stay out all night were by the deck door exhibiting behavior indicating that they wanted to go inside.  The homeowner let the cats in and stayed outside a few minutes longer.  No unusual sounds or smells were noted.The homeowner\u0092s young daughter discovered the snow tracks the following morning (Sunday) and he went into his backyard a short time later and observed two sets of unusual looking tracks that traversed his yard. Numerous fresh deer tracks were also observed and upon questioning the homeowner mentioned that January is the most active month of the year for seeing deer moving through his backyard.  The homeowner stated that one set of prints was distinctly smaller compared to the other set. Both set of snow tracks originated from a neighbor\u0092s yard which is immediately adjacent to a small road. The homeowner observed one set of tracks led to his approximately 4 \u00bd foot tall garbage can.  Several of the plastic bags in the can had been pulled out and torn open.  The same set of tracks continued on for approximately 20 yards into the neighbor\u0092s driveway on the other side of his house.  The homeowner stated that he was still having difficulty believing the snow tracks may be real and remained skeptical of the existence of large bipedal creatures.  The homeowner took 3 photos which were subsequently submitted by the witness.  One of the homeowners\u0092 photos shows a clear right foot print with four distinct, large toes.  The print has a very deep impression and is significantly larger in length and width than the homeowner\u0092s size 10 shoe shown along side the print as a reference.The witness went to the homeowner\u0092s property the following day.  He followed the larger set of snow tracks several yards into a small patch of long grass exposed from melted snow.  The witness submitted several digital photos that had some evidence of track degradation compared to the homeowners\u0092 photos taken 24 hours earlier. One of the witness\u0092s photos shows a clear four-toed right print and a second photo shows two complete strides of significantly deeper impression in the snow compared to numerous human made snow tracks seen in the same photo. A third photo showed a possible impression in the long grass at the point where the tracks ended.  The witness did not conduct footprint size or snow track stride or straddle measurements.Scouting of the surrounding area with the witness revealed a possible access point to the cul-de-sac neighborhood from an open field farm located approximately 0.5 miles away.  The back of the farm is adjacent to the Paskamansett River, a large relatively dense swampy watershed that originates approximately 5 miles to the north at Turner\u0092s Pond and flows an additional 5 miles into Slocum River which flows into Buzzard Bay. Photos of a possible large animal bedding area comprised of twisted and broken pine branches of various sizes with pine needle flooring was observed near the river. Turner\u0092s Pond is located approximately 15 miles south of Hockomock Swamp, a 6,000 acre uninhabited wetland within the \u0091Bridgewater Triangle\u0094. Hockomock Swamp is the second largest wetland in Massachusetts and contains abundant wildlife.  Hockomock is a Native American name meaning \u0093Place Where Spirits Dwell\u0094 and this area and the Bridgewater Triangle have had reports of paranormal events for centuries.  Further scouting with the witness in Freetown-Fall River State Forest (western point of the Bridgewater Triangle), was also conducted. Class B report #8972 is from this general area and locals refer to the \u0093Hockomock Monster\u0094 based on several reports from the 1970\u0092s that describe a hairy 6-7 foot tall bipedal animal.The report and photos are interesting as the incident occurred in the backyards of a residual neighborhood. It is possible that the snow tracks observed were from 2 bipedal large animals that mainly inhabit the Hockomock Swamp area and were following the known southerly winter migration of the deer population toward the warmer coastal areas. Southeastern Massachusetts has a large density deer population that is equivalent to that of the significantly less populous, mountainous areas of Western Massachusetts (Berskhires).  Future scouting and investigation of the Freetown-Fall River State Forest, Hockomock Swamp and other areas of the Bridgewater Triangle are planned.Here are three of the better photos:",
