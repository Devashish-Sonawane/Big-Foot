            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness who still lives on the property on 10/23/2006. He related his encounter as described in his posting. He grew up in the Pacific Northwest and took for granted that Sasquatch could exist but never really had an opinion either way. The witness lives in a community where the average acreage is 10 acres and is still heavily wooded. His property where the sound originated has a stream cutting through that section and is within a few miles of Lake Allatoona.He related that he was most surprised and impressed with the wide range of sound that he heard. He stated that the sound started as a low growl/moan and moved up through several octaves. It ended in a low, gutteral moan. The sound was extremely strong and moved from left to right across the back portion of his property.Secondly, he said he was surprised at the feeling of fear that came over him during the encounter and could not \"process what was making the sound\". He had two dogs with him at the time. The older dog which was deaf did not react but the younger dog began to try to get in the house as quickly as possible and acted very afraid. The other thing that he has since thought about was whatever made the sound as it was moving, had to cross over a fence and gate that about 4 feet high. Whatever it was, was able to cross this without making noise as it moved through heavy brush and got over the fence/gate with no noise.There is a large deer population he stated as well as a small apple orchard on his property.The witness has listened to various animal sounds as well as the recordings on the BFRO website and relayed that the sound he heard was similart to those on the website. He has heard no sounds since nor anything else out of the ordinary. He has had no reports or discussions with his neighbors of anything unusual in the area.",
