            "Follow-Up Report": "I had a phone interview with this witness. Being former law enforcement, his attention to detail and copious note taking after the event creates a well documented event. I will add briefly to what he has provided. Almost to the day, our conversation was the 30 year anniversary of his event. Clear as a bell 30 years later. He surmises that the creature saw him drive up and park, as the headlights would somewhat illuminate the general area he enters into the woods from the hay field. Once you enter from the hay field, you would walk up a slight hill to his tree stand, and once in the stand, it gives a decent and clear view of his hunting area. As mentioned the early morning forest activity was humming with animals in various stages of activity.Google Earth image of the area:When the forest went dead quiet, which was something he had not encountered before, he realized something was up. His description of the event is really concise and exact, and from this point, I will only add small items I got from our conversation. The rocks were golf ball and or nearly baseball sized, not pebbles. They came quite close, but did not hit him. He saw a few hit the ground and roll down the hill, which is where the size estimate comes from. He felt he was \"being told to leave\", and that he was in the creature's hunting area. The smell was a combination of urine, feces, and just filth and body odor. He heard branches, not twigs, but good sized branches being broken as the creature walked towards his location. This was not from stepping on them, but breaking them as it walked along, because he could hear the \"heavy stomping steps\" simultaneously as it was breaking branches. For him, it was an overt act of intimidation. The breathing description is wonderfully descriptive, and as conjecture only, the inhalation was more slow and deliberate, as to gather in the scents it was looking for, and exhalation was more of the intimidation factor. Again, conjecture only. He is familiar with bears, and knows the actions to take when you encounter a bear, which is why he froze. But, as noted, bears don't throw rocks. This was when he realized he was in the presence of something else. He of course, wishes now, that he had turned around, but he was paralyzed with fear. The rest of his narrative is good as it stands. He indicated this was one of his top 5 scariest moments in his life, and as a police officer, his life was in jeopardy on several occasions. This was right up there with those.",
