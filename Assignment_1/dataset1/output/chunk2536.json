            "Observed": "I was traveling on Little Kyger road toward Ohio state route 7 when I popped over a steep hill located one this stretch of road and as my headlights shown back down on the road as I topped the hill, along side the road there is a tree and a road sign, thats when I noticed this large very dark figure along the road with what appeared to be either very dark brown or black fur/coat?? it was a head taller than the road sign that it was walking in front(6 to 7 foot tall) of, it looked as if it was getting ready to cross the road out of a very wet swampy marsh area over into more wooded hills. As my lights hit it as with out thinking it turned back the way it had come very swiftly, but another interesting thing that i noticed was as it tuned to go back into the swampy area I could plainly see the entire bottom of its foot wich was very  very large and light in contrast to the rest of the creature and void of any fur/coat would very much put you in the mind of a humans foot only much much larger. and within just flash was gone.I did stop the following day to see if I could see any kinda of tracks and saw nothing but the composition of the ground would probably not yeild a good footprint next to the road as for the marshy area I didnt venture in..Very strange indeed.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked at length to this witness who works in the medical community. He is a hunter and often found in the outdoors. In addition to what was in the report I can add the following after interviewing the witness.The closest he was to the animal was about 150 feet. The sighting was at night but he has looked at the sign by where he saw the animal each day and believes the top of the sign to be 7 feet high. The animals neck and head were above the sign.He saw the animal clearly for about 5 seconds as it was traveling from a swampy area on the right side of the road. He believes it was going to cross to a grove of pine trees on the left until it saw him causing the animal to turn back around and head back into the swampy area.Of further interest to me is the fact that the sighting is roughly a mile from the Ohio river. There is a major power plant on the river near the location. Looking at a map you can notice dozens of power-line right of ways. Many investigators believe that these may serve as possible pathways for bigfoot.Another interesting note is that many people in Ohio call bigfoot \"grassman\". The first \"grassman\" sightings published were in the 1860's and in the same county as this report.",

I tried to follow the noise but it was gone in seconds so I headed back to my truck on my way back a buddy I was hunting with said he found a very big foot print it was in a foot of grass but one print pushed the grass down to the mud and you can see the print he was tracking a deer and found the print.",

After falling asleep in his hunting chair which was on the ground.  He was looking for deer before he stood up to stretch and that is when it made a grunting sound.  The witness stated stated that the sound was trees being snapped.  They were at the four foot level and were 3 or 4 inches in diameter.  He thought that the sound was being made on purpose.  He followed the trail of snaps of the trees to the edge of the hardwood forest.  The hard woods are in a ravine area.  He was on a ridge in a stand of pine trees.  He did not find anything else.  The ground was leaf littered but he was not able to see any sign of a trail.  He then proceeded back to his vehicle.  Photo of the print that his friend found:",
