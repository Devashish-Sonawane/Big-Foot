            "Observed": "I have just read \"A.D.'s\" April 1997 report about a loud animal-like noise in the wooded area behind an apartment complex on the East side of Kent. I have lived in this same apartment complex for nearly twenty years and have often heard this incredibly loud howling sound. I agree with A.D. that the sound is difficult to describe. It is a very loud, somewhat high-pitched sound that originally suggested an animal in pain. I have recently taken up an interest in Bigfoot, and after some books on the subject began to wonder whether the sound I heard was perhaps one of the creatures. Then this morning I ran across A.D.'s report and thought, \"Ah-ha! So I am not the only person who has wondered about these cries.\" After giving thought to the possibility that the cry is that of Bigfoot, it crossed my mind that rather than a cry of physical pain it might be instead a cry of emotional pain, the cry of a lonely being hoping to hear an answering cry. I have only heard the cry at night, and not as I recall in winter. For many years the cry was fairly frequent. I have not heard it now for more than a year. The area behind the apartment complex is heavily wooded. There is a dirt roadway that goes back (north) a hundred yards or so to a gas well drilled about four or five years ago and then capped off and left untended. Another fifty yards or so north is a railroad track with frequent trains. Beyond the track is more woods, within which is the remains of a toxic waste dump that was cleaned up by the EPA eight or ten years ago. Beyond that the woods ends into some homes and the town of Brady Lake.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "L.K. said the screams sounded like an animal in pain or one calling for another. He has tried to rationalize and think it might be mechanical or someone pestering a dog but has ruled those out. He has never heard it in the winter. It has been pretty constant since 1986 in the spring, summer, and fall. It has happened anywhere between two to four times a year between 1986 and 2002. Always happens at night usually late. Even with the TV on you could hear it...it was loud, with a strange echo. ",
