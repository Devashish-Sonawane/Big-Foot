All the other animals are to scared to come near the cabin and the sound was so loud it shook the wall where I was sleeping I had to move up to the loft to be able to sleep because I was on the first floor of the cabin. That sound has not left my head and I knew exactly what it was. Thank you for listening to my story and I know for sure that it was moose  elk deer bear it was a big animal and I always hear wood knocks and it feels like you are being watched my family owns 120 acres of land on a mountain and we have hundreds and hundreds of logging roads behind our cabin.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted this adult witness by telephone and asked her about the property. She said her parents purchased the property three years ago and she stays at the cabin frequently with her parents. She said it is powered by solar panels and there is no indoor plumbing so it is very rustic and isolated.She told me that she has the tendency to stay up late after her parents go to bed. She said she soon started hearing wood knocks late at night. The witness told me she was a fan of Finding Bigfoot so she recognized the sound, but she had no expectations of any Bigfoot activity at the cabin. She told me that she also would hear \"voices\" or \"whispering\" outside late at night, but she couldn't hear any actual words. She said there is no neighbors around so it couldn't be anyone pranking her. I verified that the cabin is at the end of a road that has no other cabins on it and the nearest structures are cross country through heavy timber. The witness said one time she did a tree knock with her mother present and after about a minute she had a reply knock. She said her and her mother felt weird and nervous about it so she didn't try it again. I had the witness walk me through the incidents that caused her to file a report. She told me she was up late, started hearing tree knocks that sounded like they were getting closer. She said suddenly something hit the side of the cabin with enough force to shake it. She said it was followed by an extremely loud screaming growl that sounded unlike anything she has every heard. She said she could feel it in her chest and felt like it lasted for almost a minute. The witness said she shut and locked her window, pulled the shade and went up into the loft for the rest of the night. She said she had an uncomfortable night because she was afraid to go outside to use the outhouse. The witness said she went outside the next day to look around and she observed a smear on the side of the cabin about six feet up and on the ground below there was what appeared to be a heel print. I asked the witness if she took any photos and she said she didn't because the smear had no obvious definition and the suspected footprint didn't show any toe impressions. I asked the witness if she ever stayed at the cabin by herself and she told me no. When I questioned her about who stays there I discovered that usually it is her with both of her parents, but the night of the \"cabin slap\" her dad had to work the next day so he left. She said this was the first time she had stayed overnight with just her mother. The witness also told me that bears are not often seen around there and there was no way the \"slap\" or vocalization was made by any of the normal wildlife. She also expressed her frustration of people dismissing her encounter or chalking it up to an elk, moose or bear. She told me she has no doubts what she has been encountering was a Sasquatch. When I was asking the witness details about the incident I could hear her voice shaking and getting emotional. It was obvious that this encounter shook her up. It was also apparent that she felt like her encounter should be heard after being dismissed by other people she confided in. I found her to be very credible and her emotions were consistent with someone who had a traumatic experience. I believe through the totality of circumstances, wood knocks, subdued speech, feeling of being watched, the impact on the cabin followed up with a loud vocalization leads me to believe that more likely than not this family has a Sasquatch around their property during the summer months.
