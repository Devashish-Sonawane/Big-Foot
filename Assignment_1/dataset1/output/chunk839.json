I was not, he told me he wanted to go up to the mountains for the day and do something and asked if I would like to go. I did so I got my stuff ready while he was on his way over to pick me up; all I grabbed was my boots and a .22 pistol, which was also what he was bringing (a .22 pistol). Anyway, on our way from my house, since we really didn't have any set plans on where we were going, I suggested that we go up to this rancher's place that we often hunted so we could look for antler drop offs while we walked along plinking with our pistols.",

Had a camera (Astak Mole) out on my back porch to capture animals in my yard (for fun in the summer - we see Deer frequently and Bear occasionally). I was laying in bed listening to the audio through the camera (it has a pretty sensitive mic) and heard some odd \"wooping\" in the distance. Luckily a moth or something set the camera off and it recorded two of them. I think I heard about 4 total - two are on the video file I have and will mail it to you. They sound like they're loud but distant (resonates off the hills a bit it sounds like). This was Aug. 27, 2011 at 11:41 PM.",
