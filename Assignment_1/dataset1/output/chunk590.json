I chose an area within sight of water from Clarks Hill lake, with lots of deer sign. Saturday morning, opening day, I made my way to my tree stand around 5am,a dense fog was beginning to roll in off the lake and with the darkness and fog, visibility was zero even with a flaslight.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness to this incident by phone, and he described the incident as one of the scariest moments in his life.  The animal, he said, came down the hollow that drained into Clark Hill Lake, screaming the entire way, and passing beneath him in his deer stand.  The thick fog and darkness prevented him from seeing it.As an avid hunter, this witness is familiar with normal animal sounds that are encountered in the woods, but states that what he heard was not anything like that.  He described the sounds the animal made as a female-type screaming, and that it was very loud and big, as if it were made by someone sitting in a room with you that had a good set of lungs.  He added that the sounds had tremendous strength to them, and bounced off of nearby trees.The man's hunting partner was on the ground in another location farther up the cut, and whatever made the sounds passed within one hundred feet of him on its way down and around the lake.  Also unable to identify the screamer, his partner's question upon arrival at his stand after the incident was,\"what was that?!?\"As he related the series of events he experienced, this witness spoke as someone who has encountered something he cannot explain, and I found him to be quite credible.
