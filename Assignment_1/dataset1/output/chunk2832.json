            "Observed": "Myself  and several others were at our deer hunting campsite, we had used the same spot for years. While we were sitting  at our campfire, we heard this mournful wail just outside the light of the campfire behind one of the campers. Next there was what sounded like a low growl then a sort of howl yelping sound, we all went for flashlights and stopped dead in our tracks when we heard the sounds of trees being snapped and branches breaking. We changed from flashlights to rifles as the growling increased. We stood there looking out into the dark for what seemed like 20 min or so then the sound started moving away deeper into the woods. At daybreak we ventured out towards where the sounds were coming from and found several small trees snapped and bushes uprooted. There were what could have been footprints but the ground was so tore up, it was impossible to tell what kind they were. Later that morning a friend of mine was out scouting for a place to put his blind and he came across a huge mound of earth that looked as though it was just piled there. He called the camp on his walkie talkie and told us to come out to where he was we could find him by following his trail markers into the woods going south off the logging road. When we got to him he was pointing his rifle towards some thickets of tag alder saying that when he approached the huge pile of sand and earth he heard the same sounds that we had heard the night before coming from that direction.To make a long story short we contacted the DNR in Harrisvile and an officer came out upon examining the dirt mound several mutilated deer and some wild blackberry bushes were buried in it. Again the ground was tore up so bad that no distinguishing footprints were apparent. The DNR officer said that what we had in the area was most likely a big bear. We have used that site ever since and have never encountered anything like that year again. We still talk about it over the campfire though.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This report was originally submitted to the Texas Bigfoot Research Center.I talked to the witness and found him to be credible. He is a \u0093two-tour Vietnam veteran\u0094 and in his own words he does \u0093not scare easily.\u0094 The witness described the incident as occurring in a remotely forested region of Michigan, not more than 12 miles from Lake Huron. The witness was among a group of nine hunters who had all retired to their tents. The time was approximately 2200 hours. The forest was quiet and there was a very light snow falling. The hunters had built a sizeable fire and it was apparently still going strong. The serenity of the evening was abruptly cut short by what the witness described as a \u0093god-awful sound\u0094 originating from \u0093just beyond the firelight\u0094 at an estimated distance of 20 \u0096 25 yards from the tents. The witness further described the sound as a \u0093scream\u0094 beginning in an extremely high pitch, and modulating downward in tone to a low growling, moaning sound. The sound was extremely loud and boisterous and with it came the unmistakable sounds of a \u0093bunch of trees being snapped\u0094. The witness stated that the \u0093screams\u0094 persisted along with the shaking of branches and snapping of trees for approximately one hour. In all, the number of screams that the witness remembered totaled perhaps five. The witness remembered that it was difficult to determine whether or not the hunters had more than one tormentor, but that \u0093it could have been two or more.\u0094 At one point during the incident, the hunters went to their vehicles that were parked just outside their tents and retrieved their weapons. The witness stated that he did not actually feel as though he was in a life or death situation (his weapon was a .300 magnum), but he and his hunting partners felt sure that \"something didn\u0092t want us there.\u0094 At no time during the tantrum did the \u0093two-tour Vietnam veteran\u0094 feel sufficiently brazen to venture out and unmask the unidentified aggressor(s), nor did any of his associates. After the screams and the tree-breaking, branch-shaking noises trailed off deeper into the forest, the witness and his party retired back to their tents, and the remainder of the evening was uneventful.The next day, the hunters embarked out into the wooded area where the previous evening\u0092s tirade had taken place, and noted numerous trees broken \u0093four to five feet up.\u0094 The trees were no less than \u0093four inches in diameter.\u0094 The witness described the ground as being \u0093torn up,\u0094 like something had \u0093kicked and jumped around.\u0094 No tracks were discernable but it was obvious to the hunters that \u0093something was mad.\u0094 Later, one of the witness\u0092s hunting partners found a suspicious \u0093mound\u0094 of earth as he was attempting to find a place from which to hunt. The \u0093mound\u0094 appeared to be approximately \u009314 feet in diameter\u0094 and \u0093two to three feet high.\u0094 The hunters were quite disturbed by their find and their experience and turned to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Apparently, a representative of the office came to site for an investigation. The mound was found to contain in it several deer carcasses that had been eviscerated, and had had the legs \u0093ripped off.\u0094 The hunters thought that the deer carcass wounds were not the result of cutting or chewing, but the result of \u0093tearing.\u0094 \u0093Blackberry brush\u0094 was also discovered in the mound. The DNR representative called the mound a probable \u0093bear stash.\u0094  In summation, although the occurrence seems strange and surreal to most who are not accustomed to investigating bigfoot sightings, to those of us who talk to witnesses day in and day out, the occurrence falls within expected parameters of bigfoot intimidation behavior. I must admit that I am in disagreement with the DNR representative\u0092s assessment of the situation. Although I did not have the privilege of inspecting the area, I cannot attribute any of the behavior encountered to bear. Nor can I attribute the deer carcass cache to bear. I have spoken with several bear experts and wildlife biologists in the BFRO and they also failed to see the connection.  ",

            "Observed": "It was a Tuesday evening at approximately 6:30 p.m. There were three of us in our deer camp, and three others had gone into town for camping supplies. It was the second week in November, and I was deer hunting with my family (Mom, Dad, & little Brother), and two close family friends in the Mark Twain National Forest approximately 7 miles south of Cabool, Mo. in Douglas County, Mo. My Mom, Dad, & little Brother had gone into town for supplies just after sundown, and left myself, and the two friends (Shawn & Dennis) at the camp site. Shortly after dark, we were all three sitting around the campfire, and heard what we thought was a deer rubbing its antlers. We got up and snuck back behind the tents in the direction of the sound.  We did not have any light source with us except for the camp fire light behind us. The conditions were partly cloudy, and moonlit. Visibility was really good. As we approached the area, what we immediately recognized to be a Bigfoot stepped out from behind a tree. My friend Shawn was 6'8\" and he had to physically lift his head to look at the creature's face. We instantly turned and ran back to our camp where our deer rifles were.The people in the camp next to us fired one shot into the darkness, and was yelling to get their things packed as we ran to the our camp site.  We grabbed our guns, reloaded them, and began piling more wood on our fire. We had three lanterns in camp, so I was elected to take them out into the woods just outside of our campsite on all sides to allow for better vision. We then all sat with our backs to the fire, and our guns in our laps. We began to hear heavy footsteps in multiple directions, and then we started seeing either four of five of these things circling our camp. There was one that was positioned just on the other side of the dirt road that was pacing back and forth, and stopping to squat down and stare for a moment. After approximately 45 minutes of being circled and watched, but never approached in any way, my parents returned. They were immediately concerned about the ENORMOUS size of our fire. We quickly explained what was happening, and my dad decided we should go stay in town for the night. While we were extinguishing the fire, the campers next to us made a hasty exit out of the woods. We grabbed a change of clothes and went to a motel for the night. The next morning, when we returned to camp, nothing had been touched at all. Everything was just as we had left it, including a deer hanging in a tree which Shawn had harvested the day before. My Dad gave us the option of going home, or staying to continue hunting. We chose to stay under the conditions that everybody hunted close to camp for a while. I decided to hunt back behind our camp, where the first sighting occurred the night before. I sat down on a sharp ridge overlooking a very deep, very steep valley. I hadn't been sitting there more than 10 minutes, when I saw a bigfoot ascending the steep slope on the other side of the valley. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I raised my rifle to view it through my scope, and as I watched it negotiate very treacherous terrain with ease, it turned and looked directly at me, grabbed a live tree approximately 5\" in diameter, and broke it in half with one hand. It then turned and disappeared over the top of the far ridge. I hurried back to camp to tell the others, and we went to the spot where I had seen it, and next to the broken tree was a print that appeared almost human-like. Shawn placed his size 16 hunting boot inside the track, and there was a margin of space around his boot of approximately an inch to an inch and a half.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to this witness via phone on 3/2/2013. He seemed to be a straight forward man that paid attention to detail for most of his life.  A family campsite  was made 40 ft. from the main road and a neighboring three man hunting party was located in a nearby campsite of a distance of 40-50 yards to their side with a pop-up camper.There was a thin tree grove separating the two parties. The adults and young brother left for town for extra provisions and that is when the first experience happened. The three teens were approx. 30-40 yards away from the camp when the bigfoot stepped out from behind the tree, there was around 10 ft. separating them from it. The witness estimated the figure to be 8-9 ft. tall, broad shouldered, and a thick torso with seemingly long hair. After the boys returned to the camp they noticed in the moonlit night, several figures circling the camp just outside their light. The neighboring party was hurriedly packing their camp. The daylight sighting was seen through a 4X rifle scope and he described a large, tall being with long dreadlock-like hair mostly covering the face and a short neck close to the shoulders. The hair covering the body was mainly brown but with a salt and pepper of grey. I asked if he was sure that he didn't see a man in a ghillie suit and he stated no because he could see through his scope the muscle tone in the legs and hip area as it was walking up-hill. The footprint that they found by the broken tree (which was 5 inches in diameter) was estimated to be 16-17 inches long. Unknown to the witnesses until much later, the parents of the then teen witness were separately hunting different locations earlier the first day. Both returned to the camp that early afternoon because of an overwhelming sense of being watched.I know this area very well and researched it many times. It is rich with Bigfoot history and it should be noted that Douglas County has the nickname of \"Booger County\".",
