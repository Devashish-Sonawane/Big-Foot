The location is fairly woodsy, typical Southern New England. Homes are scattered and far apart. Power Lines nearby. Clear stream on property. I have investigated several reports within a few miles of this sighting. ___________________________________Note from Matt MoneymakerThis is one of several unpublished reports from the Housatonic River Watershed which extends into three states (CT,NY,MA), beginning up in the Berkshires of Mass.The Housatonic Watershed has a history of sightings dating back to the 1800's. Click the image below to read some of that history.Long before the word \"Bigfoot\" or \"Sasquatch\" was part of the American vocabulary, people in this part of Connecticut referred to these creatures as the \"Winstead Wildman\".  Click image above to read some of that history.The witness mentions a possible incident in 1976 near Danbury where casts of footprints allegedly made their way to someone at Yale. No supporting documentation can be found for this statement but it would make sense due to the proximity of Yale to this area.  The Housatonic Watershed is very convenient to Yale.This watershed provides pathways for deer herds and their predators (coyotes, wolves, cougar, Bigfoots) to migrate south all the way down south of Danbury, and also north to the Berkshires where the forest merges with the Appalachian Trail greenbelt and then continues into Vermont, New Hampshire, and then Maine.",
