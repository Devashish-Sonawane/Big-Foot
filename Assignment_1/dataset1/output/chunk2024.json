            "Observed": "It was late April, 1994, my dad borrowed my fishing boat and went down Cypress Creek to his favorite fishing hole to try to catch a few fish. It had been a long winter and it was the first time since he had broken his hip during the ice storm that he felt like being out in nature. My dad was very comfortable in the woods and on the water for he spent all his free time there. He had lived in this area all his life.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I first spoke with this couple in the winter of 2009/2010 after they placed a call to the BFRO site and asked to speak with someone who could help them understand what had happened the night the husband's father died.  They had not filed an official report at that time.  After speaking several times, we made plans for me to come and visit the site with them when the weather broke in the spring and I made that visit on March 13th. I arrived in Alamo, TN late morning on the 13th and met this wonderful couple for the first time.  I was instantly impressed with their down-to-earth no-nonsense personalities, and their sincere desire to understand what the husband had encountered when he found his father's body.We first traveled to the site they had been living at when this very tragic event in their lives occurred.  The house is now gone, but they related the numerous odd experiences they had while living in the house - including the feeling of being watched from the woods whenever they were outside, and often hearing very heavy, slow, rhythmic breathing coming either from under their house or from just outside the bathroom window, which was between the two bedrooms.  They had several small children at home at the time of these occurrences.   The house had been located in a very rural area, with heavy woods nearby and Cypress Creek within sight.Since the route the husband and his friend took to travel along Cypress Creek in their search for the boat is no longer accessible due to a change in property ownership, we traveled further west and approached from the opposite direction, coming down the Forked Deer River to where it met the creek.  We hiked in for a mile or more, and the husband was able to take us back to the exact spot where the boat and his father's body had been found.  It was easy to ascertain, while hiking in, that both the husband and wife are avid outdoors people, who both hunt and fish and are very knowledgeable about the woods and local wildlife.Cypress Creek at this point is a good sized stream with deep pools and a strong current.  At the place the boat was found it is traveling through heavy forest, and is within yards of spilling into the  River.  Across the river at this point there is a sizable area of unaccessible woods, with no human habitations for at least a mile in any direction.  We found abundant deer sign on our hike in.  I know that this return trip was an emotional experience for the husband, but I was very impressed by his straight forward recollection of the events of that night.  This couple has done a very good job retelling their story and I only have a few points to add:.  As the husband and his friend were approaching the spot where the boat was found, they were flashing their lights around, and spotted two very large, widely spaced, sets of eyes that were high off the ground on the far bank of the Forked Deer River.  Looking at this area in the daytime, there is more than abundant cover for something large to remain concealed.  The husband reiterated to me several times that these were definitely not deer eyes and were not only different in shape, spacing and appearance, but were far too high off the ground. This witness does not know what made the clicking noises that first got his attention.  I would like to say that clicking noises have been heard on numerous occasions, along with reported sasquatch activity.  Unknown clicking noises have been heard by participants during BFRO Expeditions. .  The eyes were still there when they had back tracked and come down the far side of the creek to where the boat was resting against the bank, but it is unknown whether or not they were still there at the point they tried to paddle away. .  One paddle had been lost, so when the husband and his friend had placed his father in the boat and tried to paddle back up Cypress Creek against the current, they were using one paddle and a garden hoe that they found in the boat.  The pool they were crossing when they were hitting 'something' under the water is 15 to 20 feet deep.  I questioned the husband in depth about this occurrence and I'm completely satisfied that there was something under the water that was causing resistance to their forward progress.  Both he and his friend were continually hitting something that they were eventually able to break free from.  It is of course impossible to say what that might have been this many years after the fact.  In summation, after spending most of a day with this couple and reliving these events with them, I remain impressed with their sincerity and factual recounting of the events as they unfolded.  I can only imagine how traumatic this event must have been at the time, but am left with no doubt that two large upright creatures with very large eyes that reflected red from the flashlights stood and observed the proceedings.

One morning after the creek had frozen back hard after partly thawing my sister and i went to play on the ice. When we arived we noticed that what apeared to be a small bare footed child had walked across the ice before it had fully frozen. The track had a definite form a heel, front pad and five toes .It had crossed a distance of about twenty feet in six steps went up a steep bank slipped down and went on up the bank. No other prints were ever seen and i have never heard of any other encounters in that area. The print was about eight inchs long and three or four inches wide.",

The prints had been made overnight when something walked through the slush ice that had formed the day before from a combination of thawing and precipitation.  The toes were quite distinct and eliminated the possibility of shoe prints in the opinion of the witness. The estimated depth of the print in the ice was just over one inch.I discussed the possibility of talking with his mother about the content of the report in the other stories section.  The timing for speaking with her currently is not good because of a family issue, but I do hope to get that opportunity in a few months.",
