            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with Len, the brother who made the report, I was able to contact Mel, the brother who experienced the sighting.  Because I made contact with the eyewitness, I have classified this as a Class A report.  Mel and I have talked on the phone, and I made a trip to see the site.  He was able to give me more specific detail.  Mel works at night and was up and outside at 2:30 AM for that reason.  He said that as he came out of the trailer with the flashlight, the light was bobbing up and down as he walked.  At one instant, he caught a reflection on the 8 or 9 foot bank immediately to his right.  He shined the light back on that place and saw a large, man-like animal covered in shiny black hair, squatting on the side of the bank.  The animal turned his head away as the light hit its eyes.  Mel said the hair on his neck was long and it \"flopped\" around to the front as the animal turned its head away.  He said the hair was very shiny, and appeared soft, almost as if it had been conditioned.  The hair appeared to be about 6 inches long.  Mel was particularly impressed by the huge eyes.  He said the animal was groomed and healthy. He described his shock at seeing such a thing.  He said he turned quickly to go back inside.  He called his brother, and then went back outside with a weapon.  He could hear the animal retreating in the woods behind the trailer, making some \"weird hollering.\"  When I climbed up the bank about 4 feet, and squatted in roughly the position as the animal had, Mel said that the animal's knees extended much further out than mine, and that his head was much higher than mine.  I am 5' 4\".  The animal's posture was particularly human-like.  The animal squatted like a human with the elbows on the knees and with the arms hanging loosely in front of the knees.  Perhaps the most shocking part of the experience for Mel was the animal's proximity.  The animal was no more than 10 feet from him.  He was close enough to see lighter-colored skin where the hair was thinner near the top of the underside of the arm.  I also spoke with Mel's mother, who was there when he saw the animal.  She said he was totally shocked when he came in to get his weapon.  She said she heard the animal retreating.  She said it sounded like a heavy wind going through the trees. About five years earlier, Len (Mel's brother) and Len's wife had a frightening experience late one night. They had just moved into the same trailer after it had been vacant for some time.  The first night they heard loud calls that sounded as if an animal were in pain.  Later that night, something \"heavier than a man\" ran along the back of the trailer hitting the walls.  Len and his wife left that night.    ",
