            "Observed": "I was in my parent's car on the northwest side of  Mt. Washburn in Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming when my mom,dad,brother,and I saw a humanoid figure,too tall to be human walking upright along a ridge around 300 yards off. It looked hairy, and between 8 and 10 feet tall. It was around noon and it was partly cloudy and my family was scanning the ridge for bighorn sheep when we saw it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and his parents were interviewed by telephone on 4 August 2002 by R.D. McCuistion, Wyoming Investigator.  Because the witness is a minor, I spoke with his mother, the witness, and his father in turn.  All three were consistent in their recollection of the sighting and are considered to be credible.  As they drove north along Grand Loop Road in the vicinity of Mount Washburn in Yellowstone National Park, they observed a dark bipedal animal silhouetted on a ridge about 300 to 400 yards from them walking purposefully across a clearing between stands of trees.  The animal\u2019s direction of movement was southerly.  The biped was described by all as being about eight to nine feet tall, covered with dark brown hair, having a robust upper body with a large, wide chest and shoulders and walking upslope much as human would -- slightly bent forward as a person might be if they were using a walking stick.  Arm swing was implied.  The witness\u2019 mother stated that she looked for a snout, but saw none although the animal was in profile.  The witness\u2019 father stated that he observed the biped as it took about 15 to 20 steps before losing sight of it.  The witnesses variously observed the biped for five to twenty seconds. The location of the sighting was within two minutes driving time of the Mount Washburn Ranger Station cut-off.  ",

Trees snapped off were between 3 and 6 inches thick broken off above his shoulder level.He and a friend took the friend's jeep back to the sighting location at night last summer. They sat listening to something breaking limbs and branches for the entire time they stayed on the ridge. There was no wind; giving the impression a living creature was involved. During the past year, he reports that something large lurks around his house, about 1/4th mile from the sighting location.  It will occasionally make a \u0093wah\u0094 (short-sharp sound) vocalization, repeated for several minutes. This happens within 50 feet of his house at night. He is considering selling the property and moving away due to these incidents. ",
