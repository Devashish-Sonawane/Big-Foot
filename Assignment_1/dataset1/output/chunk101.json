I know what they sound like for I have seen one when I was around 12 years-old and three in the past few years. They call me Daniel Boone because I spend a lot of time in the woods. And I have heard them a lot of times. On 9/11/16 I was at the old farm that was once our Grandfathers, my nephew owns it now. I have a few trout in an old spring barrel at one of the springs. On 9/11/16 I went to feed the trout, but when I got there the cows were already there drinking. I looked down and in the soft mud was two fresh tracks. I ran the cows away and got my plaster paris out of the car. I made a cast of the right print, the left one set at an angle, the plaster would have run out of the track. So I got the right one, it turned out ok.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the gentleman and we spoke at length about the subject of bigfoot. He is an avid outdoorsman who loves to fish and in his earlier years deer hunted and dug ginseng. We went to the location of his track find to check it out. This was a very dry year in West Virginia and the stream near the spring had basically dried up but this spring never slows, even in the driest years. He had placed small branches and weaved sticks into a make shift fence around the spring to keep the cattle away from the head spring. Photo of the fence:Upon arriving he had to chase the cattle away and he then discovered the tracks.The cattle had already destroyed some tracks and he nearly stepped on the remaining tracks himself! He, being an amateur bigfoot researcher himself, went to his car to get casting material and returned and cast one track. He also discovered an unusual four toed track but didn't have enough casting material. Knowing the cattle would destroy the remaining print, he pushed sticks into the ground around it and covered it, returning the next day. Here is a photo of him with his first cast:These are the dimensions:19 1/2\" long6\" wide at heel8\" across the ball7\" at the mid-tarsal9\" across the toesPhotos of additional casts taken, including one of the four toed print:In addition to the footprints, he has heard whoops, howls, whistles and wood knocks at this location.He and I both theorized that with the creature's search for water, the fence he had constructed peaked their curiosity. The property is fenced and has a locked gate so access is limited. It also has approximately 70 old apple trees that still bear fruit. This, along with the water source, plenty of game and other reports from the area, make this report compelling. I plan on re-visiting the location to look around some more, take photos of the area.  Will update this report accordingly. UPDATE:I was able to go with Daniel yesterday, August 13, to find his last track location. He also sent me this photo of a sasquatch walking away from him near the same location. He did not follow. Estimated height was 8 ft. tall, at least. He said it shook him up a bit.  More photos of evidence gathered by Daniel and friends:",
