            "Follow-Up Report": "The house where this took place was designed with huge windows and was situated on 20 acres.  The witness's bedroom had two windows, one of which faced the back yard and the other window was situated 5 feet off the ground and about 18 inches away from a back deck.  The deck near the window had a railing and gate.  So if someone was to try to look in while standing on the deck, he or she would have to lean over a gate in order to do so.  The witness said he always closed the blinds on the window that faced the back yard, but didn't bother on his other window.  The house also had a yard light off the garage that illuminated the area.On the morning of the sighting, the witness woke with a start and immediately looked toward the window in question.  He saw the outline of a head, with what looked like \"messy hair\" coming out of it.  The figure was slightly backlit by the garage light.  Whatever was looking through the window ran off the deck, around the house and into the woods.  The witness said it seemed to be running faster than what would be humanly possible.The witness said to me several times that he didn't think it possible for a sasquatch to be on Hartstene Island because he couldn't see a way for this type of animal to get on an island.  There are reports of sasquatches swimming in both fresh and saltwater.  Recommended reading would be Raincoast Sasquatch by J. Robert Alley where the strong swimming ability of sasquatches is documented.  Witnesses who've seen a swimming sasquatch say that they tend to swim, frog-like underwater as is documented in  Report #7382The witness's father had other stories from rural Mason County.  As a logger, occasionally some of his extremely heavy equipment would be unexplainably moved overnight.",
