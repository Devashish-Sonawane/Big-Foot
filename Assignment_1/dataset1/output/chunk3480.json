            "Follow-Up Report": "After a lengthy conversation with this couple in Western Connecticut about the Bigfoot phenomenon/popularity, and amount of possible activity in the area, I was encouraged. Because I know the reported history of the area, this is just another testament to the area. These folks are and have been having multiple incidents including hitting the house and what sounds like dragging across the siding on the home, Whoops, chatter, and wood-knocks off in the timber line in a few areas within the farm. All this activity combined, along with him adding to this report that he saw something running, within a hundred yards upright on two legs across the field. He said it looked as though it was fast and moving effortlessly. It vanished into the timber and was gone. The couple will start doing some of their own investigating with guidance from us/BFRO. We'll see what's in the future.",
