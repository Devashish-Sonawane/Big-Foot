It ran off a hill into a little valley. It was dark black, had long arms, running way too fast for a person, black fur, 7 to 8 feet tall, wide shoulders, had a long neck. I couldn't see its face, but I saw its head and it was kind of oval. I saw it at least 4 to 5 seconds and then it disappeared into the trees.",

He was very forthcoming with me and his mother said that his reaction to what he saw startled her at the time.  I felt he was quite credible in describing what he saw, even though it was only for a few seconds.I visited the location of the sighting. The creature was described as running parallel to the highway, with the vehicles closest approach being about 50 yards. The witness said he was amazed at how fast and smoothly it ran, and said that no human could run that fast over that rocky, uneven terrain.",
