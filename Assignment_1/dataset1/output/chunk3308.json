            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness lives adjacent to a heavily wooded area near Nottingham Park. Several times between 10pm and 11pm at night while the witness was standing underneath the back deck smoking, he heard distinct whoop and knocking sounds which he described to be almost identical to the sounds in the 1974 Berry-Morehead recordings . He described the knocking as if tree trunks were being slammed together. Shortly after hearing the knocking, he heard sounds of things hitting the tin roof of their garage. The witness stated that he had never heard these types of sounds in his life before that night. Several months after that night he has occasionally heard whooping while he was out at night smoking. The witness described the area as having an abundance of deer and other wildlife. The witness described his backyard as previously being a bit cluttered with old tractors and cars. One night he heard the sounds of rustling behind the tractor. Grabbing a flashlight he walked back into the direction of the tractor into the woods and heard another distinct knock. During another instance he heard sounds of heavy footed movement through the woods which was unlike any other animal he has heard before. Recently the old tractors and cars were removed from the yard as well as having a new addition of a pen with horses. The witness has not heard any of the sounds he described since. ",

All over Idaho I have been outdoors and seen about every wild animals tracks,sounds and sign I thought was in this state. Before I found what I did I was a skeptic but not a believer  till this day.. I was living in Oregon at the time and had came back to visit family for the summer and spend my birthday with them, I was 24 at time. I went camping with 3 friend's that day. We got there around 2-3 in the afternoon. We set up our tents started a fire and we just sat around the fire talking until around 5. Then we decided to hike to the south east point of the rivers bend nearest to us. The hike there we had to go through lots of willows, brush,trees etc.. On the way there we ran into a cow moose and it had a calf moose with it. It was an intense stare down as I was not even 15 feet away from it and I could see it's hair on its back intensely sticking up as I started to move me and my friends around her. We got around here and ran into a young bull moose and found an old fallen down cabin. By the time we were done exploring around there we moved forward to the rivers end of the bend.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone: The witness found the tracks on a sandbar along the Henry's Fork River. At that point, the river narrowed to about fifteen feet wide, flowing fast. The witness estimates the river was more than six feet deep. The witness did a drawing of the location of tracks on the sandbar. The tracks were aligned as they came out of the water and again when entering the water but not aligned as they curved up along the sandbar. The witness sent this to show us where he found the tracks:He placed his bare foot next to the nineteen inch long tracks. The tracks were 50% or more wider than his foot. Five toes were seen without claws but the witness remembers marks that may have been from toenails. He ran and jumped just to get to the next track. His foot that landed in the sand did not make a track as deep as the 19 inch long tracks and he weighs 170 pounds. I asked how fresh he thought the tracks were and he felt they were 24 hours or less. He did not detect any strange odor. The witness reports there is an elk ranch about one mile downriver with over 100 elk. There are hay fields in the area that attract deer. I found the witness very observant. ",
