He was making a second loop around the bottoms that morning, like he had done hundreds of times before.  When he got half way around the bottoms; he said he heard a blood curdling scream coming from the Farm Road, in the direction of his truck.  When he got to the Farm Road he found a limb (twice the size of his thumb) had been pulled out of a live Oak Tree, and shoved 8 inches into the ground (said he had a hard time trying to pull it out).",

The permit holder may bring one other person in with them after they have harvested an animal, to assist with removal of the animal. The area is heavily wooded, extremely steep and rugged terrain, with numerous water sources, and natural grasses  interspersed across some open hillsides. The watershed functions as a large funnel, supplying water for the city of Walla Walla. The upper perimeter has a semi-maintained trail, and there are several less-than-maintained trails that run through the watershed. At the time of the sighting, there was snow on the ground, and conditions were slippery. Weather was below freezing, partly cloudy with periodic snow showers.",
