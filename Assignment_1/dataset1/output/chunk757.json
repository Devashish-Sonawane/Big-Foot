We had a small camp fire and it was dying down so we got in our bags and were shooting the breeze trying to doze off. All of a sudden we both were startled by alot of leaves and branches breaking all around us and a foul smell which I have never smelled before or since (I know what a skunk smells like and that wasnt it). There was a lot of screaming going on all around us like there was more than one thing out there. We grabbed our rifles and threw our bags in the car and got the heck out of there. We didn't have a flash light handy so we couldn't see a thing.",
