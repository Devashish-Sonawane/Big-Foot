            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness on several occasions. She was a skeptic regarding Bigfoots prior to the incident, while her husband is a firm believer. She has a religious upbringing and she follows that line, but she is science based in her view of the world. \"If I see it, touch it, etc...then it is real. If I can't see it/touch it, it doesn't exist.\" She and her husband are both hunters. They are well acquainted with the forests and all forms of animals residing there. She \"has been hunting since she was six years old with her first BB gun\". When she and her husband went hunting, he would make calls and knocks every now and then, and she humored him though she thought it to be \"silly\". Regarding the incident.She and her husband were visiting a friends home on Friday the 13th, September 2019. She wanted to get some good unobstructed photos of the harvest moon. Her friends home provided that with rolling pastures just across the road. She was using her cell phone, not her camera. She went out on the front porch (small deck) at 9:30 to take pics. As she was waiting for a cloud to position itself so she could \"steal some light\" from the moon reflecting off of it, she caught something moving in the lower right hand corner of the view screen. It was \"running in a zigzag pattern, and picking things up off the ground\".  Though the camera (phone) was in her hand, she had not set the final settings before taking the photos and it was moving too fast for the camera to focus anyway. It crossed behind a tree next to a small cow pond and was gone. It ran from right to left. Please note the satellite photo with this report was taken in April of 2018 and there is no pond. A cow pond was added later and other photos she has sent me show the pond. As far as physical description, it is limited. She estimated the height to be roughly 7 ft., and it had \"abnormally long arms\". When she first saw it, it was already moving and it bent over as it was moving and \"scooping/picking things up\" in a zigzag pattern from her right to left, which would be from south to north. (See photos). She stated \"It was not in a full crouch, nor was it fully erect\" as it ran. Upon reflection, she said \"it was running, zigzagging, in the position it needed to be in to pick up whatever it was picking up\". It put the \"object\" in the crook of it's left armr. It picked the \"object\" up with it's right hand. What she saw it pick up was \"something like a small towel, not a rigid object\". The figure then disappeared behind a tree(s) just past the pond. Then entire event lasted 30-60 seconds. It never looked her way and was already moving when she first saw. She and her husband went over to the pasture a few days later. They gauged the height and distance by standing next to a few trees and scrub brush. They also confirmed that there were no cattle or other animals in that particular pasture that night due to calving time, and they kept all animals closer to the home and barn. She is adamant that it \"was not any animal known to her, or her husband.\"  \"It was a tall humanoid shape with abnormally long arms\". She may not know what it was, but she knows \"what it wasn't\".I have attached an additional photo of the location of her friends chicken coop and where they found a pile of chicken feathers from missing chickens that were found in Spring of this year. After she told her friend what had happened on the 13th, they began discussing Sasquatch habits, habitat, food sources, etc. Her friend had some chickens go missing from a latched coop. They never heard or saw anything out of the ordinary until this event occurred across the street, and she thought it MIGHT explain the pile of feathers.",

As I walked I could sense apprehension from my girls and could feel myself. Feeling that this is from their usual fear of bears I continued the walk. As we made our way around the end of the field I looked up to notice a large black creature jump into the wood line. I looked back at my wife and the words I spoke were \u0093That was big\u0094 ...   I keep wanting to say it was a wild boar or maybe even bear. That would be fine but it walked on 2 legs and had a backside of a human or ape. And also moved like a bipedal creature.",
