            "Observed": "My name is ------.  I am a small animal veterinarian in western Massachusetts. On July 20, 2012 we were visiting our daughter, -----, in Missoula, Montana. We hiked up Waterworks (a ridge on the other side of I-90) around noon. We stopped to catch our breath and noticed a very large, dark unidentifiable object on the far ridge next to the power line poles.  It was unmoving..absolutely stock still for minutes(5-10?). We stood there looking at it wondering what it was.  All of a sudden it turned and took several large steps and disappeared over the ridge. We had my iPhone and by the time my daughter pushed the button he had gone over the ridge..we did get a picture of his head/shoulders. I can forward the picture to you.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "A mother, father and adult daughter hiked the Waterworks Trail in Missoula on July 20, 2012. It was a warm sunny day (75 degrees.) Their daughter\u0092s large dog was walking with them. It was around noon.Google earth image of the location:One person jogged by them, and she was heading back to the parking lot early on in the hike.  They got to a more open space and stopped to look. At that time they noticed a large black mass next to an electric pole.  They questioned each other as to what it could be, as it didn\u0092t move and didn\u0092t look like anything they could identify. After about 3-5 minutes, the object suddenly moved. It seemed to turn sideways and as it walked away, they noticed arms and legs moving. The daughter quickly fumbled with her camera, and was able to take a photo of it once it had gone over the ridge line. Later she returned to take a photo for comparison. The photo reveals what could be the head and shoulders of a sasquatch.Here is a comparison photo without the figure:The \"frozen\" stance has been reported many times, and is a behavior that can be typical. A sasquatch will stay very still in the hopes it is not seen. Only moving when it may feel safe. The witnesses claim the sasquatch was standing facing them with arms and legs together as if it was a tree. The shape was different from a tree which alerted them that is was something else.Seeing a sasquatch in the open during the day is uncommon. The trail is mainly used by joggers in the morning and hikers on the weekends. These hikers were there on a weekday at noon which changed the pattern, and possibly enabled them to surprise the sasquatch in the open. I spoke to all three witnesses. The mother, who is a veterinarian, knows without a doubt she saw a sasquatch. She admits this is not an animal she studied in medical school.  She is an animal specialist, and there is no other explanation as to what she saw.The father saw something large and dark walk over the ridge. He cannot identify what kind of animal it could have been.  He says it was not a man or any mechanical object.The daughter hikes here often. She has seen cows and horses near that ridge, and what she saw that morning was nothing like them. She is adamant it was not a bear, as it was much too big and bipedal. It was too large to be a man. Like her father, she can tell you what it is not, but she is hesitant to say it is a bigfoot.This report is less than 7 miles from a report where a bear biologist spotted a sasquatch, see report #36727.",

            "Observed": "On June 20, 2004, at 2 AM, I was lounging in my recliner watching TV. I noticed something like a large dark shadow looking in my window. We have four full length windows with no curtains because our family room faces the woods. I had no lights on other than the TV and my fish aquarium. The moon was slightly giving some light but not enough do make out any features. At first, I thought I was just imagining this. Slowly, I turned off the TV. When I did, the shadow moved over. I thought it was my imagination so I covered my head a went to sleep in my recliner. The next morning at 6 AM, I was still unnerved. When I looked toward the window, there was two large hand prints on the glass about 12 inches long. My brother wears a size 14 ring and these fingers were about four inches longer than his hand. It looked like a very large mans hand with fingers spread apart. I am retired from a Police Department and worked in fingerprinting and latent examination. I called my two brothers to come to my house and went into the bedroom to wake up my husband. I trembled in fear for about an hour afterwards. This thing had to be at least eight to nine feet tall to be standing where it was. I showed the handprints to my entire family. I did not want to report this because I am a foster parent and I was afraid people would think I'm crazy. On July 20, 2004, my dogs were screaming wildly. That night, my brother had stayed over since he was sick and was sleeping in the spare bedroom. At 4 AM, something was beating on the walls of my house so hard it knocked items off a shelf over the bed and dislodged my vinyl siding. This was new siding just installed in the spring! Needless to say, we were up all night. I was talking to my brother a few nights later at around 1 AM when I noticed another set of handprints on the window. Being a trained fingerprint technician they appeared to be not human and showed very little or no detail at all. The next day, we decided to clean these prints off our windows. We figured whatever left them would be back and leave some more. We used pure vinegar to clean the prints. Whatever was on its hands did not want to come off! It took some serious scrubbing to finally remove them. Other than the handprints, my windows were actually very clean. I have lived here for four years. My foster daughters told us twice that they were seeing a big man around our 1.5 acre pond. I didn't believe it was anything like this! We live in the country. Ever since we bought a large dog kennel to keep the dogs from running around this thing is getting brave enough to look into our windows and hit the house. I am convinced that something is outside my house. We live very close to Zaleski State Forest. We will be setting up my brother in laws wildlife camera hoping to catch this thing on film. I will let you know if and when we get a picture.",
