            "Observed": "I was hiking in the Wasatch mountains above the town of Pleasent Grove, Utah. I had just entered Grove Creek Canyon when I saw a large red animal up on the rim of the canyon, about 100 feet above me. It looked about as tall as a large man. There was little wind, but I did not notice any strange smell. I quickly realized that I was looking at a Bigfoot. I stood and observed the animal for about 5 seconds, then it walked away from the rim of the canyon, out of view. I looked for it throughout the rest of the hike but I did not see it again. It appeared to be looking east, up the canyon and into the small valley between the foothills, where we were, and Mt.Timpanogos. After I had watched it, it turned it's back to me and walked out of view. I can only guess that it was looking for prey. This occured sometime between 3:00pm-4:00pm in May of 1996.",

            "Observed": "Riding my bike through the woods with some friends. I had to stop to wait for them. When I heard a branch snap, No more than 40 ft away it looked right at me with large black eyes. It was about 8'-9' tell, I got a good look too I will never forget. He was proportioned the same way a human being would be, it was scary. With blackishbrown-rust colored hair. The hairs on his arm were about 3\"-4\" long. His forearm was about the size around as my leg. About 20 inches around. His strides  were long say 10' per step. He must have been watching me for sometime cause I was stopped already a minute. When I heard a  branch snap, I glanced over I was shocked and tried to figure out what I was looking at. He just stared. No noise, no motions, no jesters,  no nothing. Very frightening cause you don't know what he is capable of. It was as if he was thinking of coming towards me. He was very close, I froze like a rock. I turned my head to see what my friends were doing. Then turned back to look at him, he was still there. I know he got a good look at me too, cause it looked like he stooped his head down slightly and peered hard at me. Then he turned raised his arm to gain his balance and stepped into the woods. He didn't turn away from me but rather walked to my left his right then I lost sight of him.  I have told this story to many many people but I don't think anybody believes what I saw. I guess like I didn't believe either until I saw one with my own eyes.",
