            "Observed.1  ": "The monster hunters were looking for was dubbed the Cohomo Monster, a beast thought to be lurking in Tazewell County in the summer of 1972. James Donahue, Tazewell County Sheriff in 1972, still remembers the infectious hysteria of that summer. \u0093At the time it was a very big deal,\u0094 Donahue recently told the Pekin Daily Times. \u0093Several people indicated they\u0092d seen a monster up in that area. It was described as something like Bigfoot. All the neighbors showed up. We spent a lot of time up there. We never found anything to substantiate the claims. We were up there for a week or two weeks. A lot of volunteer people came out looking for this monster.\u0094 On Tuesday, July 25, 1972, Creve Coeur authorities reported that a witness saw something big swimming in the Illinois River. The following evening, the Tazewell County Sheriffs Department received a call from a Eureka man who said he and his family were having a birthday party in Fondulac Park in East Peoria. The witness said he and his party saw strange lights come in a vertical position and go down behind some trees. The light allegedly left a vapor or smoke trail. That same night, more than 200 phone calls about monster sightings jammed the switchboard at the East Peoria Police Department. On July 28, a rural Pekin woman reported that she saw Cohomo while picking berries by an old coal mine. The woman told the Tazewell County Sheriff\u0092s office she was so scared she ran off, leaving her purse behind. That same night, East Peoria Police said two reliable citizens claimed they saw Cohomo. It was described as 10 feet tall. The creature\u0092s face had long, gray U-shaped ears and a red mouth with sharp teeth. The reliable citizens said the creature possessed thumbs with long second joints and looked like a cross between an ape and a cave man. Newspaper articles of the time suggest that Cohomo had a horrible smell, sometimes compared to that of a wet dog, rotten eggs, or as sulphur-like. The Cohomo craze swept over Tazewell County. It\u0092s hard to pin down exactly when and where all the excitement over the Cohomo monster started. Old articles found in the Daily Times archives blame a monster called Momo who was first spotted in rural northeastern Missouri a year before the Tazewell County sightings. One of the first Illinois reports came from Randy Emert, then 18, of Peoria, who claimed he spotted some type of hairy creature in the woods near Cole Hollow Road in Tazewell County. Emert said he didn\u0092t report seeing the monster at first because he feared people would think him crazy. In 1991, the Peoria Journal Star received a phone call from Emert, who said that he made the whole thing up. Emert told the newspaper that he and his friends made the story up to scare another friend who worked late nights at a gas station. But one remains. If Cohomo was the product of mass hallucination, caused by the sightings of a Missouri monster called Momo, why did only the citizens of Tazewell County invent the elusive beast? And although he has no idea what it may have been,  Donahue says he thinks somebody may have seen something.",

            "Observed.1  ": "They said they saw it first Tuesday and then again yesterday.  \"I may be a little kid but I know what I saw,\" said 9 year-old Laurie Holmes. Laurie and the six other youngsters all described the animal they saw as between six and seven feet tall with dark matted hair, long arms, sharp teeth and four toes.  \"It could be a man just dressed up in a suit, but I don't think it was,\" said Tommy Streeter, 10. \"I saw him running on his hind legs with his arms curled out and when he turned around I saw a white streak on his back.\" Two boys, Tommy Streeter and Mike Edwards, reported seeing the skunk ape on Tuesday from a distance of about 100 yards.  \"We were walking down the path and we saw something black and hairy in the bushes. He made some deep scratchy sounds from the throat and we got scared and started running,\" Mike Edwards said.  The two also reported seeing the skunk ape reaching out the window of an abandoned shack located next to the path in the woods they sometimes take on the way to the Meadow Park Elementary School. \"He had bare skin on his knuckles and he just reached out the window,\" Mike said.  Mike's mother, June Edwards, said she might have overreacted when the children came home and reported seeing the ape. \"But if something's wrong in the area where our kids go back and forth to school then I don't think it hurts to check it out,\" she said.  She called the Sheriff's Department about the incident.  Mrs. Rita Carr, whose son Scott also reported seeing the ape, was inclined not to believe the children's stories. \"These kids have heard about the skunk ape and they have very vivid imaginations. It shows you how kids will go through mass hysteria just like grownups\", she said.  The Florida skunk ape, so named because many of those who claim to have seen him say he smells like a skunk and has the white stripe, has been sighted off and on throughout South Florida since 1971.  The most recent prior incident involving the skunk ape took place on Jan. 9 when a man named Richard Smith reported hitting an ape-like creature with his car on U.S. 27 west of Hollywood.

The best, seen by seven children altogether, is said to be six to seven feet tall, covered with hair and have four toes on each foot.  \"Artwork by Jimmy Johnston\"",
