            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. In addition to his written report, he provided the following additional information. He hunted on two successive nights. The first night was very normal with a lot of wildlife sounds, however no hogs came to the feeder. The second night was in a different location several miles from the first night location. This night, there was a complete absence of night animal sounds until the abnormal activity began. He described the smell as a combination of rotting garbage and zoo animal. The vocalizations consisted of whistling, whooping, and then grunting during the wood breaking which sounded like small trees being pushed over. Small sticks were thrown at their blind. The tree knocking began in response to the witness turning on his flashlight. Although the witness said that they heard bipedal movement around them for about an hour, he felt the creatures were more curious than intimidating. The property had numerous small creeks and ponds. Report #6941 is the one close to this area that the witness mentions.  The witness told me that he is a physician from Wisconsin and is a long time hunter who has experience with North American animals.  He is well read on Bigfoot behavior and is an articulate writer and speaker. I found him to be a credible witness.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the owner of the trail camera photo who is a 20 year-old local college student at great length. He and his family are avid hunters and the property that the camera was set up on has been in their family for two generations.  This is what he sent me, a photo of the photo on his computer screen, the second one is zoomed in on the subject.  While I was viewing the picture directly from the SD card onto the young man's laptop, there is tremendous detail that can be seen that does not come out on these pictures sent to me. I feel that this could be a juvenile Sasquatch. I am working on obtaining the original photo.The property is 62 acres of rural secluded land in central Maine which is only used for hunting. The property contains thick woods containing both deciduous and conifer trees. It has two abandoned quarries, a small pond to the back of the property, a large bog and is surrounded by hundreds of acres of woods and other bogs. There are spring fed streams that do not freeze at any point during the winter and there was ample evidence of deer, coyotes, rabbits and other small mammals. While on the property the young man (and others) have heard their names being faintly called only to realize there is no-one there. The property is also rumored to be haunted. The young man has found items on the property between the two quarries that don't belong and don't make sense (a colorful bandana and a dog toy), especially seeing the only way into the property is through a locked entry point. There are sections of the property that give the young man an uneasy feeling and there are places that his black lab will not go. His father mentioned that one of his friends will not go near the larger quarry on the property due to an experience that he refuses to talk about. While visiting the property I was taken to the exact location where the picture was taken. I was able to determine that there was nothing natural that could be interpreted as the figure in the picture. I stood where the young man felt the unknown creature had been standing (or possibly sitting or squatting) and had a number of pictures taken to try to help determine scale and size. I am not sure that the creature was standing as close to the camera as believed. Due to the distance, the young man feels that the unknown creature could not have triggered the trail cam and that it possibly could have been watching something that did. I am 5'5\" tall and if I had to guess the unknown creature could be a little shorter than me or a little taller depending on where it was and whether or not it was actually standing. It definitely appears to be healthy, robust and more stout than I am. While on the property I was able to find a tree \"X\" that was not a natural occurrence of nature due to the way one of the major components was a tree that had the thicker (root ball end) higher in the air, and the thinner top wedged and pinned to the ground a distance away. I also noticed a number of trees that had randomly symmetrical sticks wedged around their bases, some of which were of other species and did not come from the same tree.I have learned of another sighting and encounters very close to this area by other hunters, they have not submitted reports. The owner of the camera and his father were very sincere, quite open and very interested in all possibilities of what the unknown creature is in the photograph. The family has lived in the general area for 40 years and are a respected family in the community.   ",
