            "Observed": "My wife and I were driving at about 9:30 p.m. Between Grant Grove and Cherry Gap on highway 180, when we came around a corner and our headlights lit up the straight away and next corner about 100 yards away and at the next corner we saw a large hairy figure walking upright as it stepped onto the road at an angle towards us and it took large strides and crossed the road and went down the embankment. It was very tall with dark hair. I have other observations about the sighting but I was afraid I couldn't get it all done in the aloted time.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On 05/16/15 at approx. 9:45 PM I conducted an interview with the witness by telephone. The witness is fifty years old where he is employed as a building inspector and lives locally in the central California area. He is also an avid outdoorsman and hunter. The witness stated in July 2014 (unknown day) at approx. 9:30 in the evening he and his wife were driving to Hume Lake California to meet some friends for an overnight trip. The witness was driving a four door Saturn compact vehicle, where his wife was seated in the front passenger seat. The witness and his wife were driving on the two lane mountain highway 180 near a Cherry Gap. As they turned on a right hand corner area of the highway, the vehicle headlights illuminated two figures walking down the right hand hillside approaching highway 180. The witness stated the figures were approx. 100-150 yards ahead of them. This observation of the figures caused the witness to slow his vehicle, because he did not expect to see anyone out on the road at this time of night.The witness stated he observed the first figure to be very large, and walking on two feet, followed by a shorter figure also walking upright on two feet. The witness estimated the shorter figure to be approx. four to five feet tall with light color hair covering its entire body. The witness described the short figure to have a shorter leg stride, where it was trying to keep up with the larger figure who was walking in front of it. The witness stated the larger figured was approx. eight feet tall and its body was covered with hair as well. The witness observed the large figure to have long arms which swung from front to back as it walked. The witness stated his observation of both figures lasted for approx. three to four seconds, where they both walked to the other side of the road and down the embankment. The witness stated the figures walked down in to an area called Millwood Flats. The witness has hunted this area in the past, and he said the entire area is dense forest. The witness also stated the figures he and his wife saw were not bears walking across the road. He stated the legs and arms were too long and the stride was very human like in comparison, but much longer. I asked the witness if there were any pedestrian traffic on highway 180 during this time, and he said there was not. The witness emphasized this part of the highway was considered a mountain road, and he has never seen anyone walking out on this highway at night. The witness further stated he believes the two figures were not people, because the figures did not have flashlights or headlamps and both again were covered in hair.During my interview I found the witness to be very credible and knowledgeable about the area described. He has been to the Hume Lake area on multiple occasions throughout the years. It is my opinion the witness has a good concept of depth and yardage, do to his experience as an avid outdoorsman. His estimation of height from different angles along with distance is something he experiences often do to his career as a building inspector.   ",

            "Observed": "It was June 15 1997, Father's Day.  My friends and I had been rock climbing at Raven Cliff Falls in the Chattahoochee National Forest outside of Helen, Georgia.  After climbing all day Friday and Saturday morning, a rain storm made us pull down our rigging and head out of the woods.  We drove down to Helen and walked around until around 5:00 pm.  We filled up the truck and headed back up towards Raven Cliff to find a camp site for the night.  We found a small dirt road that had been barricaded with a large dirt birm.  We drove over the birm and drove into the forest.  We drove until we had a half tank of gas which put us several miles back in.  Around 11:00 or 11:30 pm, we found a small clearing and decided to stop and make camp.  Once we exited our truck, we found a shallow hole that was about three to four feet in diameter that appeared to be an old fire pit.  It had a large log laying on one side of it.  We gathered wood for a fire and began to set up camp.  Since the weather was nice, we decided to not to mess with tents and hammocks.  After about thirty minutes of laying down, I heard a noise in the tree line on the left side of our camp.  It sounded like an animal moving through the brush.  I dismissed it and tried to go back to sleep.  I continued to hear the noise for several minutes.  I have spent alot of time in the woods hiking and camping.  The next thing I heard was like nothing I had ever heard before.  I heard a grunt and then a scream that did not sound like any other animal.  It sounded like it came from maybe fifty to a hundred yards away.  I asked what it was and my friends did not have an answer.  We began kidding saying that we were out a good way and it could be a sasquatch.  I did not go to sleep for awhile after the scream.  Finally, I drifted asleep and slept until day break.  As we got up to get our gear packed, we noticed prints next to the fire pit that none of us had ever scene before.  They definitely were not human, but were to big for any animal known to be in indigenous to that area.  We quickly loaded up and left the area.",
