            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken with the witness twice by phone and I find her to be very credible. The witness recounted her experiences from over the years with vivid detail. Additional information was gained in these interviews about the animal that she observed. The animal\u0092s bottom seemed pronounced and its hair had a silvery sheen. The witness somehow had the feeling that it was a male, and said that it seemed almost playful in its movement. Its movement combined with its relatively small size makes her think in retrospect that it was a juvenile. The witness again described the legs of the animal as being thick all the way to the ground.Regarding the screams that were heard above the Mississippi River some years earlier, witness said that even though the sound of a woman screaming was very loud, her impression was that it was about a football field away. The scream was repeated five or six times. She was young at the time, and really thought a woman was being murdered. The witness remembered the baby crying as occurring a year after she heard the sound of the woman screaming. The sound was distinctly like a human baby wailing. The witness' mother's place has apple trees and a couple of ponds. One pond is fed by seeps, and is more of a boggy area. In the spring the sound of peepers is deafening. It was about two or three years ago that her mother said that her apple trees were stripped of apples, all the way to the top.The Des Moines and Mississippi Rivers form the southern and eastern borders of Lee County, Iowa, in the southeastern corner of the state. Nearby Shimek State Forest and numerous state and county parks have been established along the Des Moines River in Lee and adjacent Van Buren counties. With over 9 thousand acres, Shimek State Forest was the base of operations for the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, which was responsible for planting many northern and southern tree species for trial demonstrations. The Mississippi River is the largest river on the North American continent, and the Des Moines River is the largest river originating in the interior of Iowa. Relatively narrow valleys separate narrow, flat ridges, and area streams are slow running and seep fed. Bottomland timber species include red and white elm, cottonwood, hackberry, green ash, silver maple and black walnut. Uplands contain numerous hardwood species including hickory and five species of oak. The area is home to white tailed deer, fox and gray squirrels, raccoon, cottontail rabbits, woodchuck, muskrat, skunk, red and gray fox, coyote, beaver, opossum and many smaller animals. Bobcat, cougar and bear have also been reported. Game birds include pheasant, quail and wild turkey as well as seasonal woodcock and waterfowl. The Mississippi River is one of the primary flyways in the North American continent for numerous migrating waterfowl species. Farming is the primary industry in this region with corn, beans, hogs and beef cattle predominating.There have been numerous sasquatch sightings reported along the tributary rivers of the Mississippi in the eastern half of Iowa. The southern portion of the state experiences considerably milder winters than areas of the state further north. An unusual diversity of both fauna and flora exist in the southeast corner. Given the richness of the environmental setting of Lee County, the experiences of the witness come as no surprise to this investigator. ",
