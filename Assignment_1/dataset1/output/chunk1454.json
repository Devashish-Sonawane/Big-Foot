            "Follow-Up Report": "I followed up with the witness with numerous phone calls and an on-site investigation.  During the telephone interviews, the witness reiterated her experience, stating that she has had rocks and sticks thrown at her on several occasions, most recently in June of 2005.  The witness noted that sticks \u0093about the size of her forearm\u0094 had been thrown at her.   She also noted that rocks \u0093the size of eggs\u0094 had been thrown, and that she could \u0093hear footsteps\u0094 and smelled a strong odor \u0093like a bad wet dog.\u0094  The witness stated that when cars would pass by, the rock and stick throwing would cease.  The witness indicated that the incident lasted for at least ten minutes, and that it occurred only next to the creek.  Once she got onto the bridge, which is not flanked by concealing undergrowth, the footsteps and projectile throwing ceased altogether.  The witness indicated that the prints that she had found were difficult to discern, and a later follow-up revealed that the soil was soft, but sprinkled with gravel.  The witness stated that her sister has also had rocks and sticks thrown at her, and that two of her friends have had similar experiences.  She said that these incidents occur only at night.  When an incident occurs, she \"just stands there\" or \"walks away, and it follows [her].\"  On July 16, 2005, I visited the witness' house.  I noted that the topography of the area included marshy and swampy areas, and the home itself was surrounded by intermittent thick and sparse foliage and a Douglas Fir/Hemlock forest.  The flora of the area also included alder, thimbleberries, salmonberries and an apple orchard, and there was an ample amount of farmland and grazing pastureland.  The fauna of the area included deer, elk, bear, coyote, raccoon and salmon.  I initially spoke with the witness\u0092 sister, who indicated that she had also experienced rock and stick throwing.  The witness\u0092 father stated that the area has had activity for more than twenty years.  He indicated that in the autumn of 2002, some tenants on his property had been staying in a trailer, and on several occasions, they had smelled a foul odor \u0093like garbage,\u0094 and the trailer had been rocked violently back and forth.  These incidents only occurred between 11:30 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. A neighbor also indicated that he had two sightings over a fifteen-year span, the most recent one occurring approximately six years ago.  An in-depth follow-up with the witness included a walk along the road where the incident occurred.  She showed me where she had seen something cross the road, and indicated that she knew it was crossing, but it was too dark to discern what it really looked like, other than the fact that it was a \u0093large, dark figure.\u0094  The point of departure for the animal was thick underbrush that gradually thinned out into marshy grassland alongside the road.  The opposite side of the road had a steep, forested incline that terminated in pastureland far below the slope. We investigated the road and its surrounding areas, and we also walked a nearby forest service road, but heard nothing other than coyotes and insects.  The number of incidents in this area makes it a promising area for continued research.  ",
