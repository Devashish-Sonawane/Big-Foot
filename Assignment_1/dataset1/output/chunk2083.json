            "Observed": "It was opening morning of firearm deer season, November 15. Approximately 8:30 a.m. It was unusually warm for this time of year. I was sitting in my deer stand roughly a mile to a mile and a half away from my dad who was also in his deer stand. It was really quiet and still that morning. There was a really musty-damp smell that rose in the air. Shortly after that there was a scream that resembled a womans scream, but not quite. That happened twice within a few minutes. Made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Shortly after that the musty smell had left. Never seeing anything out of the ordinary, I stayed in my stand and finished out the morning hunt. Upon picking my dad up for lunch that day, he had asked me if I had heard the screams also. He described them to me the same way. NO other sounds were heard that day. The very next morning, my brother about 3 miles away said he had hear the same noise. Never did find out what it was exactly. It was however, like nothing I've ever heard before.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the man who reported this vocalization and his father.  Some of his father's comments include: l) \"What the hell was that???\"  (In over 25 years of hunting and being familiar with the sounds of mountain lion, bear, coyote, wolves, etc.  he had heard  NOTHING close to this sound.)2)  Both men described this series of screams as intense, loud, so strange it makes your hair stand up on end.  3) After hearing these vocalizations, over time sounds on the computer from alledged bigfoot recordings were found that were similar.4) Described, the sounds were like a woman screaming, with a high pitched end to it followed by a low growl and then back to the high pitch.    The father had one observation of a footprint that was larger than his, suggestive of a possible presence.   No specific stories amounted to any contacts due to not knowing names.One story that did surface was regarding an observation by an unknown witness who claimed something on two legs ran across the road in front of him while driving at night.
