The night-time steps were distinctly bipedal and of slow cadence. The odor was definitely not a cadaverous one, but an intense \"dirty\" animal aroma. The witness could not be positive that the animal had, in fact, urinated on their tarp or just touched it. Their small dog, which had furiously barked at a visibly approaching cougar, was silent and cowed inside the tent when the nocturnal events happened.",

He kept looking over his right shoulder at something. I wondered what he was looking at and I lifted my head a little and that is when I saw the thing. At first I thought it was a human being. I mean it had a head, shoulders, arms and legs, chest. It saw me at a distance of about three hundred feet and when it saw me it kind of hunkered down. I have seen deer do the same sort of thing when they are preparing to take flight. After hunkering down, it made a 90 degree turn and leaped and bounded through the air. Both feet were off the ground. It made another 90 degree left turn and disappeared among the trees. I could see the blackness disappearing behind and among the trees as it left. The total viewing time was no more than 3 seconds. It left in a big hurry. It was tall, about 6 feet or a little taller, black, slim and quick. I mean it was quicker than a deer. Imagine an Olympic class sprinter cooking off a hundred yard dash. Multiply that quickness by a factor of 2 or 3. It was incredibly quick, quicker than a deer.",
