It was more of a \"ker-plunk\" sound made as if a large object such as a rock was thrown into the water. He described it as sounding like someone doing the cannonball.",

He is reluctant to share it with too many people and was stoutly a non believer in such things. He is a truck driver and was doing his usual Sunday courier run around 2:30 am to Tennessee. He was traveling on Hwy 75 North at exit 285, at Redtop Mountain, when he noticed a large biped figure walking into the tree line of the median between the southbound & northbound lanes. He said it was about 8 1/2 ft to 9 ft tall, greyish in color. He could not make out any other details. He only saw it because its movements caught his attention to that side of the road.",

He is a truck driver and was traveling alone on I-75 North (a major interstate) towards Chattanooga. Nearing the exit for Red Top Mountain, he observed a large, bipedal figure moving from the left shoulder into the median, traveling from East to West. He watched as it hesitated slightly, and then moved into the median and out of view. Its gait was casual and unhurried. Based on his estimate, the creature stood approximately eight feet tall, measured by its relative height to that of the truck the witness was driving. He immediately noticed that its arms seemed long, and it appeared to have a conical shape to its head. The creature was covered in hair, with an overall coloration of light gray that included a dispersion of darker areas as well. The witness didn't notice any eye reflection. Red Top Mountain and surrounding areas have a history of sightings.   More about this area: http://www.gastateparks.org/net/go/parks.aspx?LocationID=21&s=0.0.1.5",
