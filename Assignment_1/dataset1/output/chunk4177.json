It had a face similar to an ape with dark black hair on its chest, but not its face. It had kind of a flat face and nose and eyes sunk in its sockets.\" \"As I started to run, the creature suddenly let out a blood-curdling screech and began to violently shake a sapling it was hanging onto with one hand.\" \"I could hear him running behind me and suddenly I felt it grab my shirt,\" he trembles. \"The beast held on so tight, part of my shirt was ripped off and I fell down scraping both of my knees and ripping my boots.\" \"Almost as soon as I hit the ground, I got up and started running for my life. After a few minutes I started to get farther away from it, but even as I reached my car I could see the creature in the distance.\"",
