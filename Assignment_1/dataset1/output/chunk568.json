            "Observed": "It was about 1:00 - 2:00 A.M. in the morning, I woke up to go to the bathroom, when I woke up I happened to look towards the window and I saw this huge figure standing on our front deck. There was a security light outside so it made it more visible to see. I knew that it was not a person my father is 6'3 and that creature was much taller and more broad shouldered. I did not see his actual body just the outline mostly through the window.It was just huge, and I was too scared to walk to the window and look out, I just layed down on the pallet I had made earlier that night while I was watching movies. I have noticed strange events occuring around our property, such as our ducks had ended up dead, heads had been completely torn off, and on the way to the pond in the pasture was a dead cow with most of its insides torn out. Now we did smell rotten odors, but we brushed it off as being water moccasin's because they do have a terrible odor when near by, and at the time did not think anything of it. We also raised horses but nothing had really disturbed them. I was about 7 when this happened so I was terribly frightened. And a few days after the event I was out back and I looked into the feild and saw something large walking on two hind legs I would guess about 100 meters away. I know it was way too large to be anything human. Ever since then I have been scared to go out into the country at night anymore.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness about the incidents that he described in his report. The witness told me that he was extremely frightened to see the very large figure on his deck. Upon seeing it, he immediately ducked down on to the \"pallet.\" (A \"pallet\" in this context is a regional colloquial term to indicate a bed of blankets on the floor). Even though the witness was quite young at the time, he knew that the figure was much larger than his father, who was no small person.Later, the witness saw something large and bipedal in the field. Also, the family found several ducks and chickens killed in a peculiar manner over the next few months; a distant neighbor's cow was killed and gutted.The witness said from that time on, he was terrified while living \"out there,\" and was relieved to move away a few years later. The witness stated that weird screams were heard from time to time, but his parents always told him that the source of the sounds was \"panthers.\" (I know from my own experience of being originally from this area that it is quite common there to attribute unknown night time vocalizations to \"panthers,\" having heard the very same explanations from my own parents).The witness said that he recently drove down the same road, and it is still much the same in the area, except that the road now has an oil top.

            "Follow-Up Report": "Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigators Roger Roberts and David Willbanks.In response to report from Octavia, Oklahoma on July 1, 2000, a follow-up investigation was conducted by David Wilbanks and Roger Roberts. Mr. Roberts conducted the initial telephone interview with the witness J.B. Mr. Roberts concluded during the interview, that he was both sincere and credible. Based on this interview information, Mr. Roberts asked David Wilbanks to make a search of the area in question. On July 9, 2000, approximately 1200 hours, Mr. Wilbanks conducted a search of the area, using specific directions provided by the witness. Terrain was difficult with the creek being clear and mostly shallow with moss covered rocks. There was a set of rapids on the eastern leg of the creek and about 30 yards north of the incident location.Footprints would not be possible in the creek, as it rock covered. The shoreline on both sides of the creek is generally very dense, native trees and vines, with the ground being covered by brush and leaves. Again this area is not suitable for track impressions. Mr. Wilbanks began moving back from the sighting area on the west bank of the creek when he noticed a distinct humanlike footprint in a muddy backwater streambed. This track was photographed and cast, measured approximately 11 inches in length, 6 inches at the ball and 4 inches at the heel. Mr. Wilbanks reported that during the time he waited for the plaster cast to dry, he noticed movement in and around his location and heard a \"whoop\" sound. The movement consisted of sound of sticks being broken. About 35 minutes into the cast drying process, Mr. Wilbanks noticed a very strong \"dead animal\" smell which lasted about 10 minutes and faded away. There was no wind and he had not noticed this smell previously. Mr. Wilbanks departed the area with the cast and contacted Mr. Roberts who proceeded to his location from Tulsa, OK. Upon Mr. Roberts arrival, Mr. Wilbanks led Mr. Roberts into the area at 2330 hours. Night vision was used to no avail, although on a couple of occasions, movement was detected on the eastern shoreline. At one point, a large \"animal\" was flushed on a rocky and brushy shoal in the creek, but was unidentifiable. This operation was terminated at 0300 hours. At, 1200 hours, David Wilbanks and Roger Roberts proceeded back into the area where the cast was made and were able to find 4 more tracks with the same measurements. These additional tracks were within a few feet of the track which was previously cast and one set had a stride measuring 52 inches. No other evidence or activity was noted during this search and the operation was terminated at 1700 hours, July 10, 2000. On July 22, 2000 David Wilbanks and a volunteer associate returned to the Big Eagle creek area and set camp at 1900 hours on the west fork of the creek and approximately 40 yards due west of the witness's sighting location. The campsite was about 100 yards south of the area where the tracks were located. David stated that about 2200 hours, they both heard what sounded like a person walking along the rocks on the east fork of the creek. It stopped walking and started turning over rocks in the creek and they could hear the rocks splashing and striking other rocks. This activity ceased after about 10 minutes and they believed their presence was discovered at that point. At this point, \"it\" started walking along a dry streambed towards them. It was definitely a large animal on two legs. It would pace back and forth, but stayed just out of flashlight range. This lasted about 45 minutes, then it seemed to leave the area. At about 2400 hours, \"it\" returned and repeated this behavior for another 15 minutes. After that the sounds ceased for the last time. No visual sighting was made and no smell was noticed. No tracks were found the next morning as the terrain was very rocky and brush coveredBFRO Note: Roberts and Wilbanks are currently gearing up for more stakeouts at this site with various types of imaging equipment.",
