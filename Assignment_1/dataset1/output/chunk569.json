I was road hunting up by doty washington in the woods in an area that had been closed to motorist traffic for the last 3 yrs.  I drove to the end of the road in a small clearcut that had grown up a bit.  Saw nothing, no birds, no animals, no tracks, which i thought was weird, so i was looking down at the side of the road to look on the downhillside for tracks and i saw something black move real close.  Then this thing stood up and looked at me and i stopped the truck and froze. It was realy close like 15 feet on a downhill slope that was steep and this thing was almost at my level. it was very thick and very tall like over 8 feet tall and very broad across the shoulders.  It seemed as nervous as I was. it moved side to side and was moving its arms around.  I then said something like oh my god and then it blew its checks way up and muttered something wierd and i said something i can't remember. then it screamed very loud at me which made me scream if fear and then it turned and stepped up on a stump and jumped downhill. i floored the truck and went back to my son and his girlfriend about 1/2 to 3/4 mile away where i had left them to watch for deer.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness at length on several occasions by phone and in person.  We were also able to access the site via mountain bike, as the gates are now locked.  Based on the details given, I can conclude that this witness did indeed have a close-up encounter with a very large sasquatch. His incident is particularly noteworthy due to the distance he was from the creature, and the brief interaction.  He described something not often described: puffing out of the cheeks in a threat-like display, and shifting its weight from one foot to the other, eyes darting around, and hand-arm movements.  The area where the incident happened is normally gated.  At this time, the area had been opened for the first time in three years.  This road closure had provided an excellent, mostly undisturbed sanctuary.  The habitat is rich in forage, containing a mix of swampy creeks, as well as clear-cut and timber of differing agesClick image below for larger version.Below is a artistic rendering created with the help of the the witness and BFRO investigator Sybilla Irwin.
