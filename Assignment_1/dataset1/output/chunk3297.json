            "Observed": "I was 9 in 1974. I lived on the same farm land I live on now with my husband and 3 children. My older brother and I would take the trash off to the edge of the woods where there was an old oil drum and we would burn the garbage there. One late afternoon we rode our 3 wheeler called a scattracker down the hill to the burn site and started to burn the garbage. We were watching the garbage burn and I heard a loud growling noise and turned my head towards the right where the sound came from. I saw something in the shape of a man, black and hairy.It was walking into the edge of the woods just over a slight hill. I grabbed my brother and said, \"What was that?\" He said \"I don't know but lets get the heck out of here and we jumped on the 3 wheeler and road back to the house as fast as we could. We had never heard of bigfoot or sasquatch so I told my parents I had seen a bear. My brother did not see as much of it as I had. I swore to them I was telling the truth. The coon dogs in the pen started throwing a fit, and they started to believe that I had seen something but were not sure as to what I had seen. I told them I would never forget what I saw and would hold to my story forever. Now I am 40 and I have told my children the story. Just this Saturday, my oldest son, came running to the house out of breath, saying he believed me because he saw it too in the edge of the woods past our back field.",
