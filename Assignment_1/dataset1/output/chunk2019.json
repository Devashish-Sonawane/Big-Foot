It sounded like \"whooooOOOPPP, whooooOOOPPP,\" with the rise at the end of the whistle. It was a very high, shrill sound. My family and I are not outdoorsman, so I assumed it was a bird. It happened always in the early morning, several hours before dawn and always from the same location. We simply assumed it was a bird.",

You turn right, and less than a mile later, you turn left on Cook Av.  perhaps half a mile later you round a curve and find Elmira Rd.  On the left.  This is the general vacinity from which the bellowing came from.  The location of the friend's occurance would be the same turn onto Jacob Miller, but then a quick left onto Old Discovery Rd. and taking, I believe, the second right onto Arcadia Rd - then a quick left down this dirt road which I think is unmarked except for red fire markers.  That dirt road goes for a few miles into the woods.  His Tree loft was next to a small cabin and Gazebo at least a mile back in there.",

I worked there for over four years and while I was there, I befriended the 50-something year-old night security officer, Gerry, now retired.  He had worked ther for 20 years before quitting.  One night while on duty with Doug, the local fish & game warden, he heard and investigated a large animal crashing through the woods behind the balloon hangar.  When the game worden got closer to the hanger, the crashing in the woods began again, but very close.  It so startled him that he threw his radio and ran back to the car, jumping up on top of the cruiser.  They didn't pursue it any further that night, and the following day, in the light, they both visited the site separately, without the other knowing and were disappointed to find that the forest floor. there, was inconducive to recieve a negative imprint from anything samller than, say, a T-Rex.  I personally checked the scene and found that this was the case.  But there has been one other strange deer-kill story from a prior park ranger that I feel is related.",
