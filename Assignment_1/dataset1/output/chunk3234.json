I went to see the spot of the sighting and to interview his daughter. Upon arrival we proceeded through the logging trails to the spot of the sighting. Given the lay of the land and the angle of view, I estimated the figure to be approximately 7 to 8 foot in height, rather than 6 feet as originally estimated.I asked the daughter to describe what happened. She described the figure as being grayish in color, arms reaching almost to the knees, with really big hands. Asking what she remembered most, she said its muscles. It looked like a football player but bigger. We proceeded back to the house and were joined by the witness's wife who had found a couple prints in the creek area. I found these people to be sincere.
