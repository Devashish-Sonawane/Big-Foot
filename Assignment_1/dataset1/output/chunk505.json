            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness and his wife by phone:He gave a good description of the sighting but here's some additional details. It was slightly overcast with high clouds. He said when they saw the figure come out of the tree line, it stood like a tree or statue looking to the north away from them. He does not recall any wind blowing their scent around. The figure was large with a big head. Shoulder width was a guess but was over three feet. It had very long arms that the witness saw swing when it walked in a fluid motion across the opening under the power line. The witness watched it walk for twenty five seconds or more. The wife reported to me that she saw it first and she said to her husband, \"I think that's a Bigfoot up there.\"They did not detect any odor when they saw the path through the blackberry bushes.The husband has been a hunter since age eight. Years ago, he assisted a well known investigator in Oregon who has since passed.   ",
