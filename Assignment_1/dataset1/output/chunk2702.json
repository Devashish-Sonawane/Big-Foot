She made a left turn onto Greenbush Road and accelerated to no more than 25 mph.  She and her mother spotted the animal standing next to a guardrail at a distance of 30 yards or more.  They observed the animal for less than 4 seconds before it crossed over the guardrail and out of their view.  The animal was headed in a southerly direction. She and her mother were very shocked at the sight.  She provided the following addiition details :- The overall height of the animal was at least seven feet -  She guessed it weighed over 350 pounds-  It appeared to be completely covered with long, brown and gray hair- It had long arms and legs- The face was somewhat human in appearance - but \"caveman like\" and mostly covered with hairShe is very familiar with the general area and described it as thickly wooded forest with briars and sticker bushes.I spoke with her mother at a later date.  Her mother described the animal as very large.  She stated that it all happened very quickly.  It was standing next to the guardrail at the moment she first noticed it.  It then stepped over the guardrail and moved out of sight.  The area has a history of reports continuing to the present: BFRO NJ reports",
