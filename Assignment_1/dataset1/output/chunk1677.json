Then when I dropped a tree branch down at it it quickly got up and ran into my sight in which I only saw it for about a second because of its quickness and it darted under trees...by the time I got down from the tree it was already gone.",

Then when we looked to our left we saw the head of a non human species look towards us from behind a tree and stare for about 30 seconds then ran away from us at a very fast speed.  It looked that of almost a human figure in which it was about 5 or 6 feet tall and looked fairly large...That was only the first of the occurences in which we have seen this creature.  To this day we still sight the beast around our woodland homes and have heard the screams and cries of what we believe to be Bigfoot.",

The witness has documented up to 12 sightings and/or sound events since his first encounter.The witness has found 2 deer carcasses that were ripped apart.  He did not know if any internal organs were missing.The witness has found what appear to be \"stick forts\" in the deep woods.  These structures appear designed to not only conceal, but also to provide shelter from the elements.  The witness said the roof was constructed in such a way as to make the shelter waterproof by the precise arrangement of tree bark pieces.One shelter had fresh greenery placed about the exterior which concealed the premises from view.  The witness said he approached one such fort and found a creature lying inside.  When the animal saw the witness, it darted away from the shelter and through the woods with extreme speed.The witness and many neighbors continue to hear suspected sasquatch howls and screams.This area of Cambria county has had numerous and recent sightings and will be the subject of ongoing investigations.",
