My brother and I found a pair of tracks that are longer and wider than my 9 1/2 reebok's tennis shoes. The stride was about 6 feet long. We only found 1 set of tracks so I am not sure if what we found are bigfoot tracks. I came back 4 day's later and took pictures of them.",

They haven't been into this area in more than 10 years, and described it as a pine forest with swamps, just east of Lake Michigan.  The set of prints were found a few miles from the road, about 20 yards off the main trail.  The forest floor was leafy debris and pine needles.  The only measurement taken was an estimate of the stride (about 6 feet). No direct measure of the print was obtained, but using the 9 1/2 shoe size, it is estimated at about 15 inches.  One of the witnesses observed that they were unable to leave prints in this area themselves (even at 250 pounds). Note: The date stamped in the picture is not the correct date the picture was taken.",

She was looking to the east when she saw the animal going to the south, which was from her left.  The animal was approximately 500 feet away from the back of the house.  There is a knoll there and she saw it as it walked behind it.  She only saw the upper half of it.  These are the views of which the witness watched the animal.  The animal was dark in color because she could not discern the color at that distance.  She states that the head was large, it was upright, and she did not see a snout.  She noted that the arms were big, saying that they were much larger \"than a paper towel and a half roll\".  She does not know how tall the knoll is but is afraid to look in that area at this time.  She estimates the height at eight to nine feet tall.  The sway to the arms was what caught her attention the most.  The dogs were barking and the witness states that it did not pay attention to them and kept upon its business.  There is a power and gas line right-of-way that goes through the property, and much further to the south east.  The location does not have many acres of woods,  there are a lot of farms in the area.   ",
