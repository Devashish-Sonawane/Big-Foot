            "Follow-Up Report": "When I spoke with the witness, it had only been about 24 hours since the sighting took place.  The witness was traveling southbound on Interstate 35, between Cameron and Holt,  Missouri.  It was approximately 4:15 pm on January 29, 2018. Sunset was still nearly an hour away (5:36), and temperatures hovered  near 30\u00b0 F.  As his truck entered a gradual highway curve to the left,  his eyes locked on a large, tall, brown \u0093mass\" moving in front of a treeline ahead.  For several seconds,  as his truck barreled closer,  he got an increasingly clearer view of this large mass,  that quite obviously,  was standing on two legs, walking.   In our phone conversation,  I asked him for more details on the movements. He said it was almost like it was \u0093marching\", but with a bilateral bend at the knees. We talked about it being similar to how humans walk up a steep incline,  with knees bent.  He described the sasquatch as seeming deceptively slow,  despite the large area it covered with each step.   via GIPHYBy the time his truck arrived to where the sasquatch had been standing,  it had slipped into the trees,  and vanished from sight completely. As he whisked past the spot, he scanned the trees,  but saw nothing.  With traffic not far behind him,  he was unable to reduce his speed safely for a better look.  It's likely that the other drivers did not see the sasquatch, as he sits higher up in his truck than most other vehicles.  After a few seconds of amazement,  the witness began taking careful note of his current location,  the time,  visual landmarks,  etc.   He assessed that he had been right at mile marker 35.  The town of Holt,  Missouri was just ahead. The witness estimates that the figure had to be around 10 feet tall in order for him to catch a glimpse from the original distance. The size,  along with the consistent brown color that covered it's body were strong indicators, in his mind,  that this was not a person.  There were no vehicles parked along the highway, and no sign of any road crew. Later that same day, the witness researched the area, and noted that just to the north of his sighting was Wallace State Park.  Twisting creeks frequently come close to the Interstate for miles, with wooded areas concealing hills and the periphery of pastures. On the 31st of January, the day after I spoke to the witness, I drove to the same area.  I wanted to retrace that portion of his drive, and have a better idea of the immediate landscape.  I also visited Wallace State Park, which I am familiar with. Concerning the Highway Patrol's claim that there are no bears in Missouri, that's actually not true.  According to  Missouri Black Bear Project, there are black bears in south and central Missouri.   Northern counties in the state are not on the department's radar, though,  for bear populations.  The witness remarked that his \u0093mind was blown\u0094 from the experience, and he was so intrigued and energized by what he saw, he hardly slept that night.  He replayed the events in his mind, and carefully considered common explanations that might take the mystique out of the sighting.  He confidently stands by what he has reported.  He accepts that some will be skeptical,  as he was,  and we talked about how there are very few other experiences that are relatable to seeing something that we are told doesn\u0092t exist.  I found the witness to be consistent with details, well spoken, and just as amazed as anyone else would be.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "All details were essentially reiterated in a long telephone conversation with the witness and another call to her boyfriend. She is 31 years-old and he is 38 and they have been together for eight years. They are frequent wilderness visitors for many fishing, camping and hiking trips. She was convinced that this may have been a bigfoot encounter while he tried to remain skeptical in his observations and was reluctant to admit that he could not offer a better explanation.She also added; \"More on the footprints, I asked my boyfriend about them, if he could see toes, that sort of thing.  He said you couldn't. They were too deep in the mud.  All you could tell was that it was big and heavy.  And he said the way the mud sucked at his foot when he lifted his foot at each step, that the tracks likely appeared smaller than they really were (\"sucked in\").  I visited this location the same night that this report came in to the BFRO, one week after the noted observations, and had a few observations that I believe are worth noting as well. It was a Sunday night and no other traffic or people were visibly present in this valley. Within ten or fifteen minutes of parking in the same location and starting to examine the area, from the ridge several hundred feet above and several hundred yards to the north, I heard a loud and distinct bark unlike any I have ever heard before, which I would spell \"Rawrk!\" It was a short, deep, low-pitched, resonant sound and surprisingly loud given the apparent distance. It was obvious that in the intervening week the water had been higher, many tracks of fisherman were everywhere, along with many deer and waterfowl tracks, and nothing of the possible footprints clearly remained to be found. I continued examining the immediate area for about thirty to forty-five minutes until the last hints of light remained on the horizon. As I began to get out my gear for staying the night, I heard, from the same location as the \"bark,\" loud wood-on-wood knocking of about seven or eight knocks in no regular pattern. Nothing unusual was heard or seen thereafter overnight or the following morning.This particular location was unique in this valley. It was the only specific area that offered almost uninterrupted tree and brush coverage from the mountain above, down a slight drainage into heavy brush and to the river, with brief exposure only at the main dirt road and then the pull-out road cut through the brush.This location is very near the following report:http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=2110David Petti",
