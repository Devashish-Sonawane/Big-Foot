            "Follow-Up Report": "I met the witness on November 21, a college student who has spent his lifetime hunting the area near his home where these encounters occurred.  He\u0092s experienced every conventional animal sight, sound and smell and relayed to me confidence in identifying coyotes, owls, deer and all the usual animals.  He\u0092s also encountered poachers, meth cookers, vagrants and mushroom hunters from his concealed position as a hunter.  He felt confident about his ability to differentiate known animal and human activity from what happened in the two separate encounters.The November 2012 road-crossing and October 2011 tree-stand incidents occurred on private land we now could not get to.  We did repeated drive-bys at the road-crossing location and were able to see the exact spot and discuss it from inside our vehicle.  The 2011 tree-stand location property was sold by the witness\u0092 family several months ago and permission to walk it was not granted.  I was able to see the spot from 200 yards away from public ground.I found the witness to be extremely credible.  He was troubled by both events and was not at first able to admit to himself that it all really happened.  It took the road-crossing sighting to validate to himself that he was not crazy during the tree-stand encounter.  In fact, the most recent sighting and the mysterious animal deaths have led the witness to reconsider many odd activities and observations accumulated over his many years of hunting.Regarding the 2012 road-crossing I can add:  the witness slowed at the point where the dark object crossed the road on two legs, right to left, north to south.  Viewing from his driver\u0092s side mirror, he could see the tall dark figure standing in the south ditch amongst branches across from a farm building and a private residence.  Before stopping, the figure appeared headed for a small creek surrounded by  100 feet of trees on either side.  The surrounding area is open crop fields and grazing land.  This gravel road runs parallel to and about one-half mile north of Interstate 80.  The red brake lights that illuminated the figure as he slowly drove away may explain the reddish hue he ascribed to the dark figure.  Detail related to head, face, and arms could not be given because the view lasted only a few seconds.  He could only relate an impression of largeness and the odd feeling of seeing something standing in a ditch not moving at one in the morning.   Regarding this photo, the dark figure would have appeared in the center of this image, 20 feet from the gravel road, standing among the branches overhanging the grassy ditch:Regarding the October 2011 event, I can add: Witness described the pre-dawn morning as perfect with enough moonlight to enable good visibility.  He walked from his home to his favorite tree-stand position wearing a leafy ghillie suit.  At first he thought the whistle he heard was his hunting bow rubbing against his clothing material, but he continued to hear whistles later when he was completely still.  The tree stand was located in a 50-year old grove adjacent to old-growth timber along the South Skunk River about two miles north of I-80.  The Woodcock Wildlife Area is nearby on the other side of the river.   Witness described the odor as a combination of dead skunk and wet dog.  After smelling the odor, hearing the whistles and grunts and then finally seeing two upright bipedal figures, he lost his typical composure and scrambled down his tree-stand ladder in the process abandoning his bow.  It was retrieved later in daylight with his buddy and with much apprehension.  Both figures standing were on two legs like a human, and were very wide compared to their height \u0093like a perfect linebacker.\u0094  Moonlight allowed the witness to clearly see dark, hairy figures with a reddish tint from reflected moonlight.  The witness observed arm motion as the larger figure on the left threw an object at him.  Face detail not available because they both were facing away.  Both looked like they had a sort of cone-shaped head, and per the witness, not crazy coned but like a ridge.  They had very long strides as they ran away, and their arms weren't pumping hard either (as a sprinter would) but rather the arms stayed pretty straight with minimal bending.  The witness heard thrashing through the trees as he escaped into the open field and then waited for his friend.The following is a view from the open field looking back towards the trees where the two animals were seen:Regarding the recent farm animal deaths I can add that at the time of the witness interview, no explanation could be determined.  It remained a mystery to this family.  I remain in contact with the witness and will monitor the area on an ongoing basis. The South Skunk is a small river.  The surrounding area is \u0093bottoms\u0094 land.  Satellite imagery reveals that the river used to twist and turn through this low, flat valley, but now is channelized leaving behind a few remnant ponds and woodlands in its former course. Photo taken on the South Skunk River, the animals he encountered would have retreated away and back behind the tree stand, and they would have quickly come into this river position:",
