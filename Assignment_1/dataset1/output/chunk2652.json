            "Follow-Up Report": "On March 31, 2012 the witness and his son went fishing on Flathead River near a small boat ramp. When the father went to use the bath house, he walked along the shore and noticed a large footprint that seemed to be coming from the water.  Photo of where he found the print:He followed a track and was able to find two other partial prints. One of a heel that was partially in the grass, and another that was toes with the heel in the grass. The full print was a left foot; the two partials were the right foot. Although, he had no way to measure the track he estimates the prints were approximately 4 feet apart. He only took a photo of the full print. The full print photo has a pine needle inside the print. The witness took the pine needle home and measured it at 9 inches. The approximate size of the full print is 14 inches. The print appears a few days old and weathered, but still shows considerable detail. The print is large, flat, and wide; all characteristics of a bigfoot print. It also has considerable depth. The witness is over 300 lbs. and claims his footprint didn\u0092t leave depth as the photo of the full print shows. The witness thinks the print came from the water, and continued across the road heading north to south, walking along the sand and grass. If it did swim from across the river, the river is about 200 yards wide. Also before he found the print, the witnesses noticed the mule deer across the river were acting strange. The herd ran out of the canyon as if they were spooked. Both of the men commented to each other about it, and looked to see if a \u0093wolf or something\u0094 was after the deer. They didn\u0092t see anything, but the deer kept looking back toward the canyon. They also felt a \"creepy\" feeling that someone was watching them all morning.  The morning of the find, it was 45 degrees and the fishing season had not started. It is very unlikely a human was there and barefoot at this time of year. Google earth image of the location:",

He was walking on a log when he heard \"WHOOP, WHOOP, WHOOP\".  Each whoop was rising in tone and also rising in tone from the last one. \"The hair stood up on my neck\" R. said There was was about 10 to 20 of these \"WHOOP, WHOOP, WHOOP\"s.
