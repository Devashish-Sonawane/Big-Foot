            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness via phone.  He traveled to Yellowstone with his brother for a weekend of fishing.  They parked at the trailhead and hiked to a secluded area, approximately five miles.  The location has Grayling and is called Grebe Lake.  They fished all afternoon and into the evening and caught a couple Grayling.  They noticed nothing strange during the day or evening.  His brother was fishing right up to dark.  They had supper and got into the tent to go to bed.  The tent was small with 18\" sides, no windows and only one entry door.  They had a lantern on inside the tent.  Suddenly they heard and felt something heavy come running by their tent.  They heard nothing else and were positive it was not from an elk, moose or deer.  They were sure it was two legged and too heavy sounding to be a man.  They were both shocked and did not want to look outside the tent.  The sound lasted for around ten seconds.  They heard no other sounds before or after the encounter.  The next morning they did not see any prints due to the ground cover.  We have received and published many reports from Park County, Wyoming.",

When I turned around I saw a seven or eight feet tall creature that was brown, hairy, and kind of lanky. As soon as I saw it I gasped and it took off running. Then next morning my family and I went outside and began looking around and found footprints about 14\" or 15\" inches long, and 4 or 5 feet span between each one in our garden. It appeared to be barefooted and at one point running.",
