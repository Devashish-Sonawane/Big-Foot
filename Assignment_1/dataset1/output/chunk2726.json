The local police may have these reports or maybe dismissed them since they were only word of mouth.  There was talk that it was appearing because of the bad things that were going on.  Most elderly natives here thought it was appearing as a warning since many believe that it shows up during times of bad things going on such as the suicides that were happening years ago.  Most Native people will believe in this creature and some may have seen it but didn't report it.  Now the younger people and generations of today are willing to come forward because they know there is something here.  It won't be long I believe until we have substantial proof of it being around here.",

The informant/witness asked that we not name the native reservation in the report, at least not at this time. I took a small group to investigate the terrain in this area, and the potential food sources, and the water sources. The terrain is very strategic. The potential food sources are plentiful, and there are many reliable water sources that are not affected by typical drought conditions.  Vocalizations are heard occassionally in a particular canyon near a particular small town, and the sightings have happened on the edge of this town.  The path between the canyon and the town is along a stream bed with the patches of trees and willows which provide excellent cover.",
