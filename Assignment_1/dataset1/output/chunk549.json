            "Observed": "Stepped out back for a smoke while I was on the phone. Heard a whooping sound. I stopped talking to my friend and continued to listen. I thought it might have been an elk but after hearing elk sounds definitely not it. The whoop did not tail off . It was a medium, not high pitched whoop. Very loud. Only way I can describe it is like a football punt. Whooooooooop. But stops at the high point. There was 3 or 4 of them and lasted around 3 seconds each. Continued to hear and you could hear the rustle in the thickets. Ran inside to get my roommate to hear it. When we got back out all the dogs in the neighborhood were barking. Have had odd instances at the house such as someone knocking on bedroom windows, sometimes slapping the windows.. got a security alarm for we thought someone was trying to break in. Who knows.. will continue to keep an eye out.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted this witness on the phone. He told me the account of what he reported. He heard four very loud whoops at about 2:30AM on Sunday November 7th, 2014. He also mentioned that something is slapping the house and knocking on the windows from time to time. He said that on 11/21/14 his mother heard whoops. A few days later, I went out to the residence. It is only a few miles south of my home. There is a power line running in a N-S direction that runs across the property. The area is generally forested, with scattered residences. We surveyed the scene, walking the property perimeter near the area where he said that the vocalization came from. There was nothing obvious to see. However, there are several places where a sasquatch could hide and watch the house and those inside. There is a small detached cottage which is built up off the ground. There is about four feet of space underneath. There is a large deck on this building which is built on the side facing the main home. The sides of the deck are covered with planks nailed horizontally, but with about an inch between them. This is a place a sasquatch could also hide under and view the house from about thirty feet away. This would offer excellent concealment. The witness also mentioned hearing something big drinking from the pond to the west side of the house, about 40 feet away, on a past occasion. He didn\u0092t have a clue what it was, and didn\u0092t really think about it too much. We also looked the house over for signs of being slapped, looking for handprints. We examined the windows from various angles, looking for handprints there also. I did not see any.This witness is a smoker. Smokers often get up in the middle of the night to go outside and have a smoke. They usually leave the lights off and try to be quiet so as to not wake the other occupants. They slip outside in the dark, which puts them in a position to see and hear anything that might be going on near-by. I have had other witnesses report similar occurrences. They hear sound, calls, vocalizations from all sorts of different animals who are nocturnally active. There are reports of them seeing sasquatches, generally young sasquatches playing in the yard, when they come outside unexpectedly. The description of the vocalizations lead me to believe that this was most likely from a sasquatch. It sounds exactly the same as I heard on my first encounter. Additionally, the presence of the power line right-of-way provides a path to travel. Later, I did a Google Earth study of the area, and found a route that would lead to Fort Lewis property. My son and I drove out to that place where a sasquatch would have to cross the highway to go from the witnesses location to Fort Lewis, and found several trails coming out of the brush, and corresponding trails on the other side, going into Fort Lewis property. Also, we observed that the top strands of barbed-wire were down at this location. Also observed was that in places along this side of the Fort Lewis boundary the old 4-foot high fence is still present. It has not been replaced with the newer 8-foot high chain-link fence. ",
