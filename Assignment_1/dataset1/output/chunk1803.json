            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness Peter Eisenhauer by phone. He and his twin brother are 59 years old. They have been hunting for 35-40 years. His brother was in the army. They have both heard distant gunshots many, many times over the years. Distant gunshots are the sounds most often mistaken for sasquatch wood knocks. Peter said it was definitely not a gunshot, definitely wood on wood about 50 yards away.The brothers were not standing together when the sound was heard. They were a distance apart, both awaiting deer to pass by. The first thing his brother said when they met at their vehicle: \"Did you hear that f**king wood knock?!\" There was no doubt between them that it was wood-on-wood with a lot of force, not something falling. The sound came from some thick woods to the northeast of his position (see Google Maps pin) roughly 50 yards away, close to the edge of the West River. 10 yards to Peter's west was an abandoned railroad bed which runs for many miles on a general north-south direction. There is an established game trail along that railroad bed. The two brothers have hunted this area for years because it is so plentiful with deer. He says there are collisions with deer nearly every day on nearby highway 245.For the Google Maps pin for Peter's location when he heard the sound click here. The sound came from the northeast of this position close to West River.Longitude / Latitude Coordinates: 42.679926, -77.293340 ",

But we never thought about sasquatches possibly being in there. Since those expeditions we of course began to think about that. Me & my Dad have been scouting out this one area for a while now, with Harold Benny (BFRO Investigator) and on our own a few times. It is heavily wooded and has lots of ridges & valleys, and plenty of water sources too. Tons of deer. Just seemed like an ideal spot.",
