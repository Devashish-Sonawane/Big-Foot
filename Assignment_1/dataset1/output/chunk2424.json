            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness via phone. Google Earth now shows the area cleared out and farmed in several areas. When this happened there were only two homes, his grandparents and his friends home across the road and up some.They owned 800 acres originally but slowly sold off acreage to large tree farms. Remaining family plot now has about 300 acres. His great grandparents were full blooded Cherokee. They had mentioned that something \"big\" lived in the woods, and to keep away from it. They had also told them to avoid the \"2 step water moccasin\", because when it bit you, you only had 2 steps left before you died. The sighting occurred in 1976 when he was 16 years old. As he mentioned he was visiting the farm and relatives. He decided to go visit his friend that lived across the road and up a bit. It was 8 AM and a bright sunny morning. He started to cross the road to his friends house when he first saw it. He had no frame of reference at the time, so his thought was, \"Is it an alien?\" The sight was shocking and he was trying to wrap his mind around the sight. He jumped behind a large 4 ft tree stump, crouched down and watched it. The sighting lasted 15-20 seconds. As far as he remembers, the creature never saw him nor even looked in his direction.He finally realized what he was looking at. It was not an alien. It was tall and slender, easily 8 ft tall. He used the 4ft tall fence as a reference. The fence came up to his (witness) chest. The figure was easily double that height. It didn't have much trouble stepping over the fence.It was \"silvery white, and walking straight up, not leaning at all\". It stayed focused, never looked back, nor wavered in its path to where he lost sight of it. He first saw it at about 80 yards away, and from the stump where he was hiding to where it hit the tree line was about 144 yards. He saw nothing more than a brief side view and then just the back of it. When he got to his friends house and told him what he saw his friend grabbed a \"30/30 rifle and was headed out the door\" to go after it. He settled him down and nothing else happened after the sighting.In Google Earth you will see that there are other homes but in 1976 there was only his grandparents home, with the red roof, and his friends house, which was across the road and up from where he lost sight of the creature. Entire area was heavily forested back then to the point \"you could not walk 10 feet into the woods without having to alter your path to avoid bramble bushes and more trees\". Directly across the street from his grandparents home was the original  home of his great grandparents, mostly gone by now, but some of it is still standing. The Arkansas River nearly completely surrounds the area on two sides, and is not far from the site [1.24 miles]. Thousands of acres of still heavily forested areas and open farm land, complete with crops and game. Ample top shelf habitat for a Sasquatch.He has had ample time to consider the event, and he is \"firmly convinced\" of what it was. Great, articulate witness.",
