With her experience working with and around animals, having been a bear hunting guide in Montana, and volunteer at area animal shelters as a Vet Tech, she knows animals. The way she described the animals condition and anatomy was extraordinary.I believe many people in that situation would have been very frightened and left the scene immediately. Because of her experience with dead and dying animals, she was able to determine she wasn\u0092t in danger and rather felt compassion for it in its condition. After visiting the area and exploring it thoroughly, I found it to be an excellent habitat. Lots of sign of game, a river with a healthy salmon run (as evidenced by the Bald Eagle population) and plenty of dry covered areas beneath the tree canopy.I asked the witness if she might sketch what she saw. She did. Here is her drawing:",

            "Observed": "Me and two other friends arrived at a campsite near Cooper Lake Washington we settled for a campsite that was a couple of miles away from the lake because we couldn't make it past the snow. As we pulled into the dirt road that brings you to the campsite there was a tree covering the road into the site so we moved the tree and proceeded down to the campsite. We found as we got there that the previous campers have left their gear and it seemed as though they were in a hurry but we didn't think much of it other than that they were rude and disrespectful for leaving garbage and stuff laying around. After we got camp set up and got a fire going it started to get dark and down about a hundred feet of elevation in a two hundred yards away we heard a noise that none of us had ever heard before sort of like a really rapid yodel or tongue trill. The girl I was with was immediately frightened and hid behind me and my other friend said guys don't get too freaked out it's either like a wolf or a coyote and we listened again as it covered that 200 yards distance in about two seconds. Became much louder and four or five times vocalized this yodel I almost couldn't answer it from fear, but I was able to let out a scream. After I screamed it became silent and then behind us something hit our truck, sounds kept happening around us and we started to try to see what it was. This noise was very loud and very close and quite obviously directed at us. After that we heard wood knocks through the night but no more Close Encounters as I stayed awake most of the night in fear with one hand on my knife and one hand on a flashlight. This was amazing and intense and absolutely true I was definitely skeptical about the existence of Bigfoot before this trip and now I have absolutely no doubt that they are real.",
