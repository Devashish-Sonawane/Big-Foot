            "Observed": "The creature was not tall by any means probably in the low 6 foot range, I would compare to my current height of 6'1\".  The hair/fur was a rather rusty brown and wavy or matted. It didn\u0092t look like a recently cleaned coat if you were to compare it to cleaning your dogs coat etc. It looked like it was unkept and even sort of dread-locked appearance hair. I do recall that some of the hair on the body was rather long about 10 inches and I could see it move as the creature walked away. It looked a lot like of the reggae/rhasta type hair styles but not completely covering the body but just various strands of it throughout (maybe shedding from winter??).  The creature had a rather glum face or expression, like a lonely old man who didn\u0092t have any friends. I do recall its eyes sort of reminding my like that of an orangutang and sunken in.  It by far didn\u0092t look evil, or mad in any way even though we were terrified. I think we may have woken it up and it was surprised and maybe a little irritated that it had to leave its comfortable seat next to the creek.  The hair around its head sort of drooped down on the sides. There didn\u0092t seem to be much hair on its face but it did have some. The nose may have been flat. I don\u0092t recall any details about the mouth or ears etc. Its possible it had a slight cone shape to its head but not drastic.  I don\u0092t recall any smells or odors associated with it.  There really wasn\u0092t a neck and when it moved its legs just seemed to float forward without any obvious effort. The animal appeared confident, agile and very graceful.  Once it disappeared into where-ever, I don\u0092t have clear details into the rest of the moment.  I know we walked over to the site and I felt the tree where it was sitting and recall it was warm to the touch.  I think we looked around for tracks and there may have been some but it was so mucky and swampy it wasn\u0092t clear, but I\u0092m fairly certain we could at least see that the ground and brush was a little disturbed etc.  There was not a lot of vegetation between me and the creature as far as having part of my vision blocked. I could see the entire creature for the most part except for minor sticks and things in the way as it moved.  We more than likely hung out at the spot for sometime recalling what we saw as young kids do. I think back now though, that I don\u0092t recall each of us sharing exactly what the other one saw because I think we each thought that we saw the same thing.  As far as arm size or length I don\u0092t recall a big size comparison but I think they were a little longer than a humans. It seemed to walk with its arms to its side with maybe the forearms slightly facing out/forward like a jogger but its arms didn\u0092t swing at all to my recall.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone, and he was able to recall his experience quite vividly.  He and his friends routinely went back into this swampy area and never seen anybody, or anything, until this incident.  He first seen it as it was getting up to walk away from them, about 70 feet away.  The witness and his friends initially 'freaked out', and watched as this creature walked deeper into the cedar swamp.  He was able to watch it for about 10 seconds before he lost sight of it. His overall impression of the creature was that of 'an old man', seemingly bothered by an intrusion into his area, and wanting to get away from them.  It had a gut, and its hair wasn't consistently covering its body, looking 'ratty' in places.  It also wasn't as tall as many witnesses describe sasquatches to be - only about 6 feet.  The witness' description of its fluid walk, lack of a neck, and longer-than-usual arms correlate with many other sasquatch sightings.The three friends eventually composed themselves and walked over to the stump they thought the creature was sitting on.  The witness remembers this tree stump as being warm to the touch, so it is possible the creature was using the stump to rest on and possibly watch them play before standing and leaving the area. See Report #7800 for another possible encounter in Crawford County. ",
