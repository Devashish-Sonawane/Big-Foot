It was a cold rainy night and we were on the back roads to our house and we rounded a curve and our head light hit it. It was in the middle of the road and then it just took one step and it was off the road. It was brownish grey in color and it was wet with rain looked like a long hair dog when wet. My husband and I looked at each other and said did you see that?",

She and her husband were driving around 11 p.m. on a rainy night, coming around a curve when they both saw the creature standing in the middle of the two-lane road.   It did not turn to look at their car, but rather continued crossing the road directly into the woods.  She estimated the creature to be around 7 feet in height, and the brownish-grey hair was wet and matted. They talked about this incident for days.  This area is next to the Chickamauga Lake and Tennessee River, with abundant fish and wildlife.",
