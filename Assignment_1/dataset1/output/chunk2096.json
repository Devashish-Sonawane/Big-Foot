            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness B.F. on the telephone and learned that she is a 53-year-old registered nurse. She is an avid hunter and experienced in the outdoors. She repeated the information in her written report with good consistency of detail, and added the following additional information: She was resupplying her bear hunting bait site with a co-worker. B.F originally looked up to spot the animal when she heard branches breaking on the side of the hill above her. She saw a piece of a tree fall and spotted the animal higher up. The animal was broad shouldered, dark (the color of a moose), and appeared to be standing on two legs. She was confident that it was not a moose because she would have necessarily been able see the moose\u0092s whole body when it later moved into the trees. \u0093Moose don\u0092t walk sideways like that,\u0094 she told me. She estimated the animal was seven to eight feet tall. She said she made this estimate by comparing the animal to the trees. She couldn\u0092t make out much of a neck or head, but she saw \u0093something on top of the upper part of the body.\u0094 She estimates she looked at the animal for about 15 to 20 seconds. It moved into the trees with three quick steps, which she described as \u0093bump, bump, bump\u0094. Her companion was not interested in observing the animal, and dismissed it as a moose. Later when the two of them were discussing the incident with others he said he \u0093didn\u0092t want to have anything to do with Bigfoot.\u0094 B.F. climbed the hill to attempt to investigate the area where the animal was standing but there were too many broken fallen trees.  Due to the drought many trees had fallen over because of soft soil.Her bait site did not appear to be disturbed but she noticed a rancid smell that she could not compare to anything. When she went back at a later time to replenish her bait site she noticed the same smell throughout the area. She emphasized that at the time of the sighting she only noticed it right by the bait site. Food items left at the bait sight included apples, chicken, and hot dogs. She never spotted a bear on the site that season or any evidence of it having been visited by a bear. She did not think a Bigfoot had been eating the food at her site. Her basis for this inference was that not much of the food from her bait sight was ever eaten (she had to haul most of it back after the baiting season was over).  In addition, her bait can was situated with heavy tree limbs on top of the bait barrel which a large animal would have to remove to get a good sample of the bait.  None of the limbs were ever undisturbed.",

We all got out and we were told to stand away from the road. My sister looked down into a little valley where a river was running. She had said look at those. As we all looked down we notice there were large footprints in the sand along the river and leading to the east, uphill toward the forest edge. As we talked about what they might be we all heard some noise coming from the top of the ridge on the other side of the river. Thats when we saw just for a moument a large creature walking on two feet over the ridge and out off sight. We jumped back into the car and drove off. I may have only have been 8 but I remember it clearly.",
