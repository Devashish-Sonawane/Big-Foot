I had noticed earlier that day the dogs would go nuts barking into the woods. Since there were no other campers within miles of us I figured it was deer or some other critter they were barking at. It was after midnight and was quite dark the fire was down to coals. I got this intense feeling that I was not alone, I put it down as over active imagination that feeling you get when you are alone but feel like someone is watching you, so I decided to head for the tent.",

He imitated the sound to me on the telephone and it didn't sound like Elk to me, it sounded like the Tahoe tape, which was used on the Skookum expedition. Wapiti bulls bugle and whistle with a deep terminal, guttural call at the end and is quite distinct. It is the wrong time of the year for the rut bugles but the single cows who have given birth a few weeks ago probably all returned by now to the cow herd. Any alarm calls from the cows would be more like a bark or if calling a calf, a high pitched neigh.His sister inlaw made the observation of something large moving by the kids tent at about 10:00PM. This moved the classification from C to B.",
