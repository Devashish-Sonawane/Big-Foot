            "Observed": "Hello I had my first encounter about 18 years ago. I lived at that time at my parents house.. Me and my cousin where chilling on this log in a ravine talking and out of the corner of my eye I saw his dog chasing a rabbit then when I looked back a couple minutes later i saw the rabbit chasing the dog. I though that was strange didn't think anything of it. We headed back up the hill to the gate and when i shut the gate and ready to lock it up thats when we heard this blood gurling growl and howl we both looked at each other and ran down the hill and jumped the electrical fence and up the hill by our grandpas building I looked back and there it was so tall and stared at us for about 20 second then I seen him turn and head back down into the woods.  Then about 2 years ago I found this stick structure shed while I was hunting which looked out of place and odd. Then last year when deer hunting I seen this thing run through the woods and heard branches breaking, while leaning on a tree waiting for deer, very frightened didn't want to move.  South Skunk river close to our place too!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke to the witness. Regarding the first sighting, It was starting to get dark and they decided to head back to the house.  The pond ravine area was about 50-60 yards away, downhill distance to the 2x2x3.5 tall gate they could hear the sound like a growl from behind them. They took off running from the gate towards the next pond, jumped the three foot livestock electric fence about 20 yards away. As they were at the shop building which is about 50 yards from the pond, turned and saw a reddish 7.5-8 foot tall figure with about 4-5 foot shoulders. The figure was by the gate that they had heard the growl, gate was about waist high.There is a forest preserve in the area, plus creeks, farmland and a lot of wildlife like deer, possum, raccoons, rabbits, birds and fish. Find the witness to be credible.Since filing the report he has experienced a horrific strong smell of something in the area, when walking the fence line. ",

The hike along Dry Fork was fairly flat and very pleasant.  But after hiking a mile and a half and crossing the stream (Dry Fork) -- the trail snaked its way up a very steep mountain for over two miles.  I remember the hike quit well, because both of us were loaded down with heavy packs and inflatable rubber rafts.  After several hours of hiking in heavy timber, we finally topped the mountain at 9,995 feet and reached Round Lake.",
