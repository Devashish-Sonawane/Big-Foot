            "Observed": "While camping in the Sierra, several members of our group were awakened by  repeated screams very similar to the Klamath and Washington State sound files at bfro.net.  I first  heard the eerie bellowing screams at 4:45AM and they continued until 5:05AM, followed by another short series soon after .  I thought it was over for the night until a short series of screams began at 6:30... from a different direction.  The vocalizations were grouped in a pattern of 4 or 5 \"blasts\" (lung-fulls?) with a (resting?) pause of a few seconds followed by another series of 4 or 5, a pause, and so on.  This continued with only slight variation for 20 straight minutes; then the two other series mentioned above. While my wife says her heart was \"beating like crazy\", I was simply astonished. I've been interested in the bigfoot phenomenon for more than 30 years, so I had tears in my eyes as I paid close attention to this almost indescribable sound. To my thinking there are only two possibilities to explain these nocturnal screams: 1) Someone playing high-fidelity recordings at high volume at 4:45AM, or 2) A sasquatch was screaming out  at night in the forests of Calaveras County. Either way -- MANY other campers had to have heard what we did.",

The following details can be added to the report:--Witness is a high school biology teacher (21 years), with a degree in biology.--Witness is familiar with various owl and mountain lion sounds, and the scream heard was not any of those familiar forest animals.--Other people in the campground, including other people witness was with, also heard the screams.--First set of screams seemed to come from up country from the location of the campground, possibly a mile or so away.--Scream was very long and sustained, high in frequency, with a falsetto ending that echoed.--They stayed another night, but no further screams or sounds were heard.--Outside of some bear footprints in camp, no footprints or other Bigfoot sign were discovered.
