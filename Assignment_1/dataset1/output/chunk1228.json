            "Observed": "When I was in my early teens, my aunt was dating this fellow who lived in Avery, CA. He was an aspiring carpenter who was trying to build a cabin on his property. Though the main house was already completely built, he took it upon himself to build this cabin directly across the way, on the side of this hill. Running between the main house and the cabin was a creek, which stood at the base of the hill, that had a bridge crossing over it. Anyway, my aunt had decided to move in with him during their courtship and they decided to live in the cabin as it was being built. I had spent my summer there with them that year, but this was my first time being there during the winter. The area (Avery) in which they lived was heavily forested and fairly remote, with the nearest neighbor being several miles away.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness by phone.  The following details can be added to the report:--Witness was about 13 or 14 at the time.--The property is not far from the Avery Hotel.--The area was very remote in 1978.--Witness was scared, so he didn\u0092t look out the window.--The witness could see the tracks coming down the hill and followed it to a barbed wire fence.  The prints by the fence were continuous, like the bigfoot had just stepped right over the 4.5 foot fence and kept on going.  The tracks went around the cabin and down to the creek.  Like the barbed wire fence, it appeared the bigfoot jumped over the 7-8 foot wide creek.  The prints continued up the hill, where the trail was lost.--The impression of the witness was that the bigfoot was just going by the cabin.  Based on the footprints, the bigfoot made no attempt to approach the cabin.  The witness felt that the bigfoot may have tried to approached the cabin if the dogs had not been there.--The witness mentioned the prints to a guy in town and the guy said that bigfoot was well known in the area and that others in the community had heard screams, etc.--The witness visited the property in 2001, and the person who owned it in 1978 still had his name on the entrance gate.  After checking the name given to me, I verified through County property records that this person still owned the property.",
