Suddenly I heard the sound of footsteps walking through water. It was a unique sound because it was a very distinct \"caploosh Gloomp\". \"caploosh Gloomp.\" It sounded like when I have walked through knee deep water in the past. Then, I heard a roar like nothing I have ever heard before. It sounded angry and a bit like a lion. There was splashing and then the sound of a squealing animal in distress, followed by more splashing and more roaring.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted Gus (the witness to the incident in 1979). He was very surprised to hear from me and even though he hasn't talked to an investigator since making the report in 2011. I found him to have an excellent recollection of the event.Gus had accompanied his father on a fishing trip that day and ended up at Clendening Lake. Although he wasn't able to see anything due to the overgrowth of thick brush and briars, the sounds of what was happening resonated across the still waters.What initially sounded like an animal in distress turned quickly to a predator chasing his prey into the water. Scared by the loud roaring howls, Gus decided to get away from there. He woke his father up and his father was able to hear some of the commotion as the boat was motoring away from the area.Once back at the Marina and while grabbing something to eat at the diner, the waiter noticed their fearful looks and asked what was wrong. Gus was surprised at how the waiter shook it off, as if it was normal around there.This area has a long history of Bigfoot sightings along with unknown sounds emanating from the shores, the hills and hollers around Clendening lake that continue to this day. The witness and his father will add another to the growing list of locals that are quite certain what is lurking in the surrounding area.-------------------------------------------------------------Matt Moneymaker's note:  The Buckeye Trail runs along the south side of this lake. There are other reports within a short distance of Buckeye Trail.",
