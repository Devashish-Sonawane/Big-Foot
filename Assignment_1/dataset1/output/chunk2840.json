While running its knees were bent.It did not look like a man running in a race, like a sprinter. The levee was just on the river side of cat building ss (Caterpillar Heavy Equipment Company). I saw the tan man for maybe 5 or 6 seconds. The speed at which it had was awesome. I could see the hair moving on its body but its head did not move. I just can not get over the speed tan man had, unreal.",
