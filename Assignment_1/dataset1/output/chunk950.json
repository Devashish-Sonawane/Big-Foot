            "Observed": "My girlfriend and i had been shopping at walmart in spruce pine nc late one night. we left to head for home which is about a 20 min drive. by this time it was about 2 am. we left wal mart and headed back out the highway toward the turn-off for marion(home). no cars were out only us, we see in our headlights about 150 feet ahead a dark brown hair covered animal crossing the road very slowly. We were probably traveling about 35mph. we looked at each other as if to see if the other was seeing the same thing i leaned forward in my seat to see if it was a bear, about that time we realized it was walking on two legs and was kinda side stepping and it was staring right at us. it was moving from the left side of the road to the right and then just disappeared into a field. we slowed down just as we approached the spot, it was and it was gone, no sign of it at all. this was something that neither of us had ever seen! I felt like whatever it was layed down in the field so we couldn't see it any more.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness to this incident at length on the phone. The witness is a former Park Ranger and now teaches emergency personnel in Off Road EVO (Emergency Vehicle Operations). I find the witness credible and truthful.The witness stated that he and his wife had gone to Wal-mart in Spruce Pine, NC on the night the incident took place (Wal-Mart being roughly a mile from the Blue Ridge Parkway). He stated that after leaving Wal-mart around 2AM the return trip to Marion, NC took them on a rural back road between the two towns. The night was described as being clear and cold with nothing that would interfere with visibility. This was late September early October time frame. Witness couldn't recall exact date due to the time between incident and present. Witness stated that he was in the passenger seat and his wife was driving at a speed around 35mph - 40mph at or near the posted speed limit. He stated they were having a general conversation as they rounded a curve in the roadway. The first thing noticed as they came out of the curve into a straighter portion of the roadway about 100 - 150 feet in front of the vehicle was a very bright eye shine (yellow in color) from their headlights. He told his wife to immediately slow down because there was something in the roadway. He leaned closer toward the windshield of the vehicle (believing at first it may be a bear), trying to get a better focus on the animal in the roadway. He stated at that moment he realized that the animal was on two legs and not four. Animal was said to be walking from the left side of the roadway toward the right side of the roadway. The animal was somewhat \"slumped over\" and its arms extended down to about the knee area. The animal was covered in a reddish dark brown hair or fur and appeared to have a \"strong upper body (thick) with strong legs, approximately six to seven feet tall.\" The animal appeared to be \"side stepping\" across the roadway. The animal continued in a quick side stepping fashion towards the right side of the roadway as they approached closer in their vehicle. The animal exited right side of roadway on two legs into a field that contained \"knee high grass\". Witness stated that his wife slowed almost to a complete stop as they looked into the field trying to see the animal. They could not see any signs of an animal or any type of movement in the field. He stated there was no doubt that the animal had laid down in the tall grass in an effort not to be seen. He and his wife continued to look into the field for a couple of minutes and saw nothing. They could not understand at that moment how the animal had evaded being seen in the field. They later concluded that the animal must have lain down. Witness stated he and his wife did not discuss the event immediately. Witness said it took a few minutes for them both to process what they had seen. He was absolutely sure that this was not a bear or any other animal he or his wife had ever seen.Witness did state that there have always been people speaking of these types of incidents occurring in the area, he just never thought he would ever experience an event like this in his life. I will be visiting area in the near future by invite from the witness.  E.O.R. ( End of Report)",
