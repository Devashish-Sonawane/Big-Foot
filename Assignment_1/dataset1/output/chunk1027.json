            "Observed": "This incident happened last night just after 11pm. My daughter was home alone. She lives with a relative, who was out of town. She called me at 11:22 pm; she was terrified. She said she could hear something walking back and forth by her bedroom window. She also said she looked out the window when she first heard it, and saw \"something\" big and black, really big. She described the \"thing\" to have been about 3-4 feet above the bottom of the window. When I went down to look behind the house this morning, I stood by the window. I am 5'4\" and my eyes just reach the bottom of the window, so I figure this \"thing\" must have been 7-8 feet tall. We live in a small village of less than 500 population.  There are a lot of bushes and trees in between the houses. Their house is close to the beach, and there is forest surrounding the town. Now, I've never known my daughter to afraid of anything, but last night when I went to pick her up, she was shaking like a leaf, she was hysterical, it took me almost an hour to calm her down. I questioned her about what happened. She called me about 5 minutes after she first saw it.  She was too scared to move. When I got down there, I would not look behind the house, but she was hiding in my relative's closet. She said it was walking back and forth right behind the house. She described the footsteps as a sound that someone very large walking on two feet, kind of like a \"stomping\". My daughter is very down-to-earth, not one prone to dramatics. When I first went down there, I didn't really know what was going on, just that my daughter was scared spitless, but I would not look behind the house. When I went up to the house, my hair felt like it was standing on end, and I had goosebumps really bad. I was scared and didnt know why.",

When the reporting witness arrived at the site, despite not being previously particularly alarmed, she had a sudden feeling of anxiety or dread and found it difficult to exit her car to get her daughter from the house. The soil behind the house was too compacted to produce footprints.",
