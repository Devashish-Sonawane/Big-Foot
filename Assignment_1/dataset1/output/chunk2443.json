We parked in the town of Knoxville Maryland and crossed the rail road tracks to get to the river. We were fishing in a brach of the Potomac that was about 600 meters long before it went back into the river. We got to the spot around 8:00 AM we had our backs to the Potomac when fishing the banks of the branch. Behind us was the Potomac. There was an island that was about 600 meters long and about 200 meters at it widest point. The island is a hill and you can't see the Potomac from were we were fishing. We were only there about Five mintues when heard what sounded like a dying deer. My friend heard it too, I said it sounds like some one shot a deer and it was dying. This whole time we were walking down the river and fishing at the same time. As I got farther down the branch of the river my friend said what is that alful smell. I said it must be that deer.",
