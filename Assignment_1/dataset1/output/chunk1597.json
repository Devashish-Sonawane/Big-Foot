From our discussions, a few details can be added.He was driving at a moderate speed of about 35 m.p.h. when, out of the corner of his eye he noticed some movement off to his left. Almost immediately, within two or three seconds a large upright figure dashed across the road from his left to right. The sighting lasted for just a second and crossed so suddenly that he didn't even have a chance to step on the brakes until it had already passed in front of him. The figure was brightly illuminated in his headlights but was so close, probably within five feet, that he was only able to see from its thigh to its shoulder. The lower legs were out of his view beneath the hood of the vehicle and the head was above his immediate field of view and out of the light. He described the torso and arms as \"skinny\" and mentioned the prominent swinging of the arms.Several local residents and police officers are now in contact with each other. Their investigations are continuing.David Petti",
