            "Observed": "Not a good writer, but what happened to me and a friend  - we were walking down an old pulpwood road with his german shepherd  and got a strong smell like a goat and stopped my friend. I walked ahead about 20 ft and said it might be a big rattle snake, about that time I heard leaves rustling and it got louder and a tree about 6 inches around shook back and forth about 2 feet each way and I heard the leaves moving like something was running away. I pulled some branches back and there it was, about 20 feet running away on 2 legs at a very fast pace. It was about 8 feet tall and I could see its muscles in its legs moving and the whitish skin under the 3 inch black hair. Long arms no neck as plain as day. My friend never saw it and didn't believe me. But it changed my life. Would like for someone to call me. Two weeks later in the dentist was an outdoors magazine with the Patterson film in it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I found this witness to be truthful and straightforward about what he saw.  After a lengthy interview with the witness, the following can be added to his report:The goat smell was very powerful.The creature was running downhill.The arms stayed down with the hands just below the knees and did not swing as it ran about 100 yards in about 10 secondsThe shoulders were about 4\u0092 wide and the hips were about 3\u0092 wide.The head looked small in proportion to the body compared to a human and was slightly pointed at the very top from the rear view.It was lean and had a very muscular, athletic build.  It was not as bulky as the subject in the Patterson-Gimlin film.The calf muscles, with white skin, were huge and could be seen when the 3-4\u0094 long black hair would flop up as it ran.The hair appeared to be clean.The witness could hear it running, but it was not very loud.The sighting was in an area with pines and a few large hardwoods.The creature ran to an area with pines and underbrush, which is where the witness lost sight.  The area beyond the pines was swampy. The witness never returned to those woods and lost interest in camping after the encounter.The sighting area is now developed, but there are still thick, unpopulated woods to the south.His friend\u0092s dog was well trained and never left his owner\u0092s side.",
