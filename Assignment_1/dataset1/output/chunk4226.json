            "Observed.1  ": "She believes the clumps came from a bigfoot. No one has proven the existence of bigfoot - or sasquatch or yeti or skunk ape, as some call the creature. Klopp is convinced the forest dweller is really out there. \"Oh definitely,\" she said. \"I don't think people should go around shooting him if they find him.\" Her sasquatch keepsake comes from her parents. Klopp said her parents were driving along in the 1960s, towing a small trailer, when they swerved off the road to avoid hitting what they believed was a man.  Klopp said her parents stopped at the Porter Creek Store to assess what had happened. They got out of the car and searched the area, but they found nothing. The next day, her parents discovered pieces of skin and hair snagged on the trailer. \"This is something you don't run into every day, quite literally,\" Klopp said. She said the material was sent to the University of Montana for testing about 3 years ago. The results showed the DNA was too deteriorated and the hair too degraded to make any identification. Klopp still believes. She decided to share her story after hearing reports that someone in Texas had killed a bigfoot.  \"There are reports that someone has one and has shot it and is storing it in his freezer,\" Klopp said. \"I would like to know for sure.\"",
