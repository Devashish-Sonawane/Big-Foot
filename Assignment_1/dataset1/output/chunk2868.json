            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone. She now lives in Utah, but related the experience in detail, as she remembered the incident clearly. She was walking a two-track in a wooded, swampy area and first heard, then saw the animal rapidly moving away from her. She said at first she thought it was running, but later felt that it was walking rapidly, although either way, it was moving quickly. She did find two tracks, which were approximately eight to ten feet apart, which would indicate the animal was moving rapidly.She could only make out three toes on the tracks, but stated there could have been more toes that did not show up on the ground. She estimated the tracks were around eighteen inches in length. She stated the color of the animal was a dirty white color. She clearly saw the arms swinging and the legs moving. The witness had a neighbor at the time that was experiencing some strange incidents at his house, which is very near the location of her sighting. Her neighbor has something, or someone, break into a storage shed he owned and stole some food items he had stored inside. He mentioned something about bigfoot being involved to the witness, and thought he was imagining things until she had her encounter. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, Patricia Parcel, and her son Adrian. She is 65 years old and lives in Belmont KS with her son. They have lived in Belmont for two years or so, and lived in Kingman KS before that.This brief sighting occurred two days ago (5/17/21) around 6pm. Her son was driving her back home from a doctor's appointment in Witchita. She spotted the figure as they were crossing the bridge over the South Fork of the Ninnescah River. They both saw the figure briefly but she got a better look at it.  She estimates it was 150 feet away from the bridge. He estimates 200 feet away. It was on the north side of the bridge and the west side of the river. It was across from the small island visible in the photo below, which she sent me a little while ago after returning to the location with her son to take photos of the location. The location of the intersection signs (see photo below) is half a mile west of the bridge.She and her son both say the water level is higher today than two days ago. More of the sandy creek bank was visible then. The figure was standing on the river bank out from the treeline. It was a few feet from the water. Right now the spot where it was standing is under water. She could not guess the height of the figure but both witnesses say it was reddish brown and distinct from the green treeline behind it. She is certain it was covered with fur. She says she could definitely see its arms and hands. The hands were darker in color than the body fur. She had heard about two other BFRO reports on or near the same river over the past 20 years so she would look for  sasquatches whenever driving through the area.She thought she had seen a similar figure in roughly the same spot previously but didn't get a good look at it while passing over the bridge. This time she got a better look at it. There was nothing like a stump or debris in the area spot today.The pin on the map may not be the exact spot the figure was standing but it isn't far off. The county road crossing this river is the type of back road in Kansas which may only see a few vehicles each day.  Her son says locals driving these roads do not drive faster than about 50 miles per hour because there are so many deer it is unsafe to drive any faster.This location seem like a good place to look for tracks, etc., right now.For the Google Maps pin for the location of the figure seen in this incident, click here.]",
