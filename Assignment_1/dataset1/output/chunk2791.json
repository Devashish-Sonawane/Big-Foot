When I looked my cousin had run home.I ran next.",

The creature's face was more gorilla-like than human-like, and the arms were proportionally long reaching to about knee level.  It moved upright very fast and in a very graceful motion.  He estimated it to be 7 - 8 ft tall and around 500 lbs.  The creature was moving through dense briars and underbrush with no difficulty.  Although this occurred almost 30 years ago the details are very clear in the witness' memory.",
