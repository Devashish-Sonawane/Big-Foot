I heard what sounded like what I've heard the investigators on FINDING BIGFOOT do when \"callling\" to a bigfoot.  It was coming from about 1 mile away from the Tombigbee Water Way.  We're on the west side of the waterway.  We're in a rural area and are accustomed to hearing a variety of animal noises but, I've never heard this sound before.  We hear coyotes all the time and I suppose it's possible this could have been a coyote but, it struck me as being a sound like I've heard the investigators making on tv.  I heard it twice during the time I was out with the dogs and even mentioned it to my husband when I came in.",

I would not normally publish a report such as this due to lack of evidence, but I am going to do so since we are aware that there have been reported sightings and encounters in this county. I'm hoping that others may come forward with additional information if they're hearing or experiencing similar events. During our conversation the witness said that the noise heard wasn't similar to anything she'd ever heard before living in Mississippi. She did say it's possible that the scream could have come from a coyote, but if it was from a coyote, she said that she had never heard a coyote make such a scream before and she estimates that the scream lasted for approximate 8-10 seconds. During our conversation she also mentioned hearing a wood knock later the same night that she heard the scream, but since she had already submitted this report she was unable to mention the wood knock in her report, but she did mention it during our phone conversation.
