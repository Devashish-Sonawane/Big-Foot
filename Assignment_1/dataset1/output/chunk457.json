After several phone interviews I can add the following details to this report:The witness regularly travels here to camp, fish and hike.The raised area of the foot in the photo may be what is referred to as the midtarsal break.The witness discovered another partial print approximately 30 feet away. It was noticeably smaller in size and had been stepped on by another hiker. All that remained was the impression of the toes and front portion of the foot. The witness did not photograph the second print.The witness related another discovery on this trip. Alone, he wandered off down a side trail near the Sol Duc river where he often fishes. There, tucked away and hidden from the nearby trail was some sort of structure. The witness described it as oblong shaped, about 10 feet across and 4 feet high. A tangle of branches formed an overhang with an opening on one side. The witness became uneasy when he noticed the leaves were still green and appeared fresh. He followed his urge and immediately left the area. However, he plans to make a return trip.Another report by this witness: Report #6058 ",
