KCAssociate Researcher, Report Follow-up, 11/24/03:\"When I called and identified myself, the witness hung-up on me.  I called again and was able to talk to his father.  He said his son was very nervous about talking to me so I agreed to hear the story from him.  (Note: I do not generally post a 2nd hand report - however, I'm making an exception because the son was physically in the room, and because the site is relatively close and we will be doing further follow-up with the witness.  If there are any significant updates, we will post them immediately. KC)On Nov 15th, 2003, approximately 10am, the witness was heading east on (edited).  The creature was sighted on the south side of the road.   He had passed a field and saw a large black creature walking on two legs on the far side.  He stopped and  reversed his car to get a better look.  The creature immediately went into some brush next to the field and laid down in the brush as though hiding, but its legs were still exposed.  He was able to view the creature through his binoculars as it lay there.  He could see the legs were hairy and says they were too big for a human being or bear.  When he started to leave he noticed the creature getting back up - he saw the creature walk deeper into the brush.  He then lost sight of it and drove on home.  The witness did not exit the car at anytime.  Therewas no other traffic.  There are homes approximately a 1/4mile away from the sighting location.\"",

I would like to touch on the sense of being watched. I feel certain that there was some sort of extra sensory faculty at work here. I was in a meditative state while alone on the hill side and was in a \"pure consciousness\" state. A state where there is no thought but just being(awarness). I was in the process of expanding my field of consciouness when I felt the other presence. I feel that this may have been a factor in this episode. Like maybe it was drawn to this awareness. Also ... I never felt fear even for a moment. I have read many other accounts and know that this sense is common with this experience. I do not claim to be psychic or have ESP.",
