            "Follow-Up Report": "I called the witness and we talked about what he heard.  He was positioned along the south bank of the Cowlitz River, about 150 yards downstream from the boat launch. He and his partners heard what he described as chimpanzee-like screaming coming from the thick brush near the top of the slope.  I was unable to meet the witness at the location, but did make an on-site survey.  From what I could see from the boat ramp, there is a faint trail that follows the river, parallel to the road, and about 20 feet down from the top. The slope is too steep for safe travel by a human, but game animals could use it. This trail would provide cover for an animal to move unseen in the narrow area of the slope between the river and the road. I was also fortunate enough to be able to fly over the area with fellow investigator John Callender, who is a pilot.  This provided me with the opportunity to get some aerial photographs.This is a view of the site from the air.This is a view of the site from the boat ramp. The vocalizations came from the steep slope to the right. The witness was on the left bank when he heard the calls.The witness is a life-long outdoorsman, as is his brother, who is also a witness (see Report #24772).   He says that he has heard the same vocalizations near the graveyard where his brother had a Class A sighting.  It is unlikely that this witness would not be able to identify this vocalization if it was from one of the common animals or birds that inhabit the area. The similarity of the sounds from two separate events, the Class A sighting nearby (only about a mile distant), and the persistent sightings and encounters in the area, lead me to the conclusion that the witness most likely heard a sasquatch.",

I monitored from 2:30 am to 4:30 am.  There are a few residences where I was, but the area is surrounded by Simpson timber land.  The Washington State Penitentary is closeby.  It was perfect noise monitoring conditions, clear night with no winds at all (extremely quiet).  Right when I started my measurement I heard coyotes from the direction of the driveway, off in the distance.  A few dogs in the distance barked at the howls.  I then heard some different animals.  I heard 2 or 3 screams from one location and a single scream in response from further north.  These screams seemed to be communicating to each other.  It lasted about 30 seconds or so.  The dogs in the distance continued to bark, although the 2 dogs in the yard with me did not.",
