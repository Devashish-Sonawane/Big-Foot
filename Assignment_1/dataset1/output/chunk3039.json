Go up the trail up Big Burns Creek until you come to the first Large canyon with a creek flowing down it from the East. That will be Little Burns Creek. ??about 4-4 1/2 miles from the trailhead.?? I don't care if you post the area because there is already alot of people that go into this area in the summer time, horses riding, hiking, Motorcycle riders, etc. Not too many during the hunting season.
