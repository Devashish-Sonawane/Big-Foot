We had just been down near Window Rock, AZ and were heading back to Farmington, NM.   The easiest way to do so is going over Narbona Pass.  The speed limit on this road is 65 and I was travelling at 65 when coming around a corner just south of the picnic area (there is only one area that is located east just off the highway).   As I came around the corner I noticed something moving rapidly in a diagonal direction up the side of the hill just where the forest meets the meadows lining either side of the highway. It would be the east side of the road.  I slowed down and said to my friend \"Did you see that?!\"  he had seen it as well.  I hit the brake to get another look but knew that by the time I backed up it would have been long gone.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "As stated in the report, this encounter was witnessed by two separate individuals, the driver of the vehicle (submitter), and one passenger. I interviewed each of these men by phone and found their recollection of the event to be basically similar. Since the passenger was not concerned with driving, he was able to see the creature for a longer period of time and in greater detail. Below I will add each witness\u0092 additional observations.Driver:-Estimated initial sighting distance at 50-60 yards.-Length of observation approximately five seconds.-Body covered with four to five inch long hair, described as the texture of a horse\u0092s mane/tail, black with a red tint, \u0093prune juice colored.\u0094-BFRO report #490 details an earlier encounter of this witness.Passenger:-Estimated initial sighting distance at 50 yards.-Unsure as to length of observation, but definitely longer than the driver\u0092s.-Slope was quite steep going away from the road with scattered trees, becoming more heavily timbered further up. -Creature was bounding up the steep slope on two legs, taking huge strides, and using its right arm to grab trees it passed to help pull itself along. Appeared to be carrying something in the left arm, but witness couldn\u0092t see what.-Body covered with three to four inch long hair, black/brown in color. Could clearly see a bouncing motion to the hair as the creature ran.-Proportions include a long torso, long arms, shorter legs, rounded head, short \u0093bulldog\u0094 neck, and a very wide body.                          -Witness is 6\u0092 1\u0094 and said the creature would have \u0093dwarfed\u0094 him.-Did not notice any ears.This sighting occurred in the sparsely populated Chuska Mountains of northwestern New Mexico. Located within the Navajo Nation, the surrounding area varies between approximately 8,000\u0092 to 9,500\u0092 in elevation. There are numerous water sources nearby.",
