Baker is a crater or depression, and the trail runs along the upper rim.  This is where the sighting occurred.The witness is very familiar with big game and has been tracked by wolves and bear.  He knows the feeling one gets when not alone.  The event started with finding tracks; then he smelled something like a wet dog, but he thinks the animals moved and the wind stopped transporting the smell to him.  Then further along the trail he came within 15 - 20 feet of the adult sasquatch.  He didn't notice it at first, until it moved a little.  It was multi-colored with gray, brown, and light reds, blending easily with the trees.The sasquatch was squinting at him, but when it noticed him looking back at it it opened its eyes more, then reached behind a tree and gently moved the child out into view.  After the child went back behind the tree he got the impression it wanted him to leave.He noticed hair on top of the feet, but not on the bottoms.  The skin was grayish-pink in color.  The face was dog nose in color and texture.  The tracks were about 15\" in length.The witness now lives in Juneau Alaska.",
