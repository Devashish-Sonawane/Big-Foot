I lived at the house by the levee in my childhood years 1965-1968. Immigrants had a shack against the levee and always had a gather for the weekend. One day my Mom was out to show the Men how she could shoot her New 22 Ruger rifle at the tin cans. After all the fun, a man was just having an idea if he could just use the rifle on Saturday morning for cottontails, Dad and Mom was happy to let him use it !  Saturday came around and I noticed the home made rack with  cottontail and Jack Rabbit hanging upside down near the small cabins to the side of them. My brother told me to go with him and check them out! it was sad to see such a kill. That evening the men showed my Dad how beer batter makes a good rabbit roast over the fire, and we all had a share of the food with wild rice and flour tortillas.",

He described the overall appearance as \"huge but skinny\" and said the legs looked powerful.- He estimates the creature was 25 to 30 feet up in the large cottonwood tree.
