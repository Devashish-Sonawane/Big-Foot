I agree with the submitter that, even though he and his friend didn't see the creature described in the report, the only thing that seems to make sense is that the creature they heard was a bigfoot.I don't feel the submitter of the report needs to make any apologies for the length of the report. To the contrary, I'm pleased with how thorough and well-written the report is.Pre-history note from investigator: Twenty years ago the skeleton of a Colombian mammoth, Mammuthus columbi, was discovered in Huntington Canyon, not too many miles from where this bigfoot report took place. The mammoth skeleton was determined to be 11,200 years old. The 10,800 year-old skeletal remains of a giant short-faced bear, Arctodus simus, were found at the same site. Also found at the site were stone tools from prehistoric human hunters. I have to think there may have been bigfoots living in the area back during the time when mammoths, short-faced bears and prehistoric people roamed the area. I think the descendants of those bigfoots are still there - and still eluding, and occasionally frightening, humans in the area. ",
