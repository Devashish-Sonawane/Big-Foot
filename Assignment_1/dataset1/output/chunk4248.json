Bipedus giganticus, sasquatch or big foot, has been declared an endangered species in the US. Thus, habitat must now be protected for it even though its existence has not been proven nor a single specimen collected! This even beats consideration that a Puerto Rican cockroach is endangered and its habitat must be protected. (People can't clean their own kitchens?)",

            "Observed.1  ": "The federal government still intends to bring an Endangered Species Protection Act to Parliament that would affect the use, enjoyment and disposition of property and threatens to hamstring sectors of the economy that utilize land and other natural resources. We also note that the Alberta government will introduce its own Endangered Species Act. We remain extremely nervous about these initiatives and their suspected impact on agriculture in general and the ranching industry in particular. There have been numerous problems for all resource users associated with the Endangered Species Act now in force in the US. The same situation could easily emerge here.9 The WSGA recommends against adopting such legislation. Instead, government should encourage private arrangements to protect habitat such as those arranged by the Nature Conservancy of Canada, the Deseret Ranch in Utah or the Government of Zimbabwe for protecting elephants. The fact is, we know of no species of plant or animal that has become extinct if it is privately owned, at least in part. The same cannot be said concerning species `held in common' or protected by legislation. Further, the experience of cattle producers in the United States is that they have shouldered the cost of protecting species and natural resources for the public good. Their reward has been the loss of use and of value of their property. As the province becomes drawn in to the protection of so-called endangered species, the WSGA recommends extreme caution so that the rights of Albertans are fully protected. To that end, we recommend the adoption of the following goals in a bottom up approach. 1) Land goals: maintain productive capacity for producing food and feed through sustainable development (existing long-term agriculture policy); management of habitat for both domestic livestock and wildlife; control access to such lands to limit disturbance to all species; and empower the landholder to make appropriate management decisions. 2) People goals: allow local stakeholders a voice in the process; maintain necessities of life; and maintain quality of life. 3) Financial goals: determination of all direct and indirect costs of protection; determination of all economic impacts and all benefits; and preparation of a comprehensive budget to show how and by whom the action plan will be paid. 4) Global goals: action plan must further global goals of protecting endangered species and species diversity including the production of food here in exchange for sustainable, environmentally compatible development in areas at risk, such as the Amazon rain forest. 5) Government goals: create a regulatory environment that facilitates flexible responses to endangered species management and avoids coercion of landholders; provide integration and funding of the foregoing processes; and facilitate management by landholders.",
