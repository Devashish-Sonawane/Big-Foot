            "Follow-Up Report": "On 1-29-2-13 I performed a site visit.  The following can be added to the report.I found the witness credible and sincere.The area that the witness lives is less than three quarters of a mile from the Ravenna arsenal.  The arsenal has over twenty-eight thousand acres of land that is fenced off and not accessible to the public. It is also near several creeks and ponds that support a diverse ecosystem of flora and fauna.  The footprint that was found measured between fourteen and fifteen inches in length.  It was located within a hundred feet of the house and fifteen feet from an out building.  It was facing south.  Only one print was found and the area was searched for others.  At that time they took a picture, but through the years the picture was lost.  Also they checked for other prints but none were found.  She stated that the toes looked deformed and had no explanation as to why this would be.  She was emphatic in her statement that the print did not have any claw marks.  I showed her several pictures of bear prints, including overlapping prints that bears make and she stated that they were not the same as the print her and her family had witnessed that day.  The sounds have eminated from the north west and west though the years.  The area is all wooded, and the nearest dwellings are well over a mile away to the west.During my investigation the witness also told me about how an old set of stairs had been moved, blocking a trail where the witness would walk her dogs.  They spoke to the neighbors asking if they knew who did that and responded that they did not.The vocalizations were heard mostly at dusk, but on occasion they would be heard later in the night and on one occasion woke the witness up.  I played several suspected bigfoot vocalizations for the witness asking her if they sounded like what she had heard from the woods.  After playing the 1994 Ohio - Moaning Howl she stated that it sounded very similar.  That area of Portage county has had a long history of sightings and reports.",

            "Observed": "I was 12 years old and my father was stationed at Ft. Polk, Louisiana. We were living in a town called Leesville just outside of the military base.  Two friends of mine and I decided one day to explore the woods off of a highway known as Texas Highway.  I remember we were deep in the woods and we came up on a stream, quite large, about eight feet in width. From the side of which we approached the stream we were about five feet above the water and as we approached the stream the three of us immediately spotted two Creatures on the other side of the stream in a crouching posture position drinking water from the stream.  We froze in amazement of what we were looking at, and at the same time the three of us were trembling with fear knowing we were so deep in the woods and quite lost.  We were looking at two Human/Ape like figures whom were completely covered with darkish brown gray hair but the face appeared to be of lighter tone skin. From the head down the two creatures had long hair past their shoulders,with alot of long grayish hair tones, the rest of the body was short hair. They were starring at us and we were starring at them..One was of adult and we could tell it was female and the other was childlike and was of male gender in appearance. They appeared to be just as frightened as we were and after about 30 seconds of this encounter the adult creature turned to the childlike creature and made a motion with it's hand and they turned around from the stream and started running through the woods. There was never a sound made from either one that we could hear. Needless to say when they took off running we did the same in the opposite direction and didn't stop until we were out of the woods. At that time we never spoke about the incident to an adult because we were not supposed to be off on our own exploring in the woods.",
