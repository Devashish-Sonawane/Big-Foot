            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the husband and wife by phone:The first whoo vocal was from the north and less than one quarter mile away. They both thought it was a person trying to get the attention of someone else. The second whoo also came from the north but only about seventy five to 100 feet away. The husband said it was so loud and powerful, he could feel it in his chest. The hair on the back of his neck stood up and he felt afraid. The wife did not realize at the time how afraid he was. Each vocal was about two seconds long. About one minute after the second call, the wife heard a response from the east-southeast. It was far away and thus sounded softer. They did not hear anything walking nor detect any odor. They told me they have owls around their house and so hear them all the time. They later researched owl calls and could not find anything similar to what they heard. The region from Sullivan Lake in northeast Washington to Priest Lake in north Idaho has a long history of activity and continues to have ongoing activity for many, including this investigator. ",

I was about 100 yds off the three miner log cabin remnants sitting on a rock enjoying peanuts and water when, looking west, I saw a very large brown biped approach the snow wall / cornice and seek to climb it. The biped was unable to climb up over 20 feet, moved back down laterally to its right, and then down to the ground off the snow. It then walked on two legs very briskly to the right, subsequently out of my view. About 4-5 minutes later a hiker with his dog came walking down the trail. And I later saw this brown biped from time to time walking above the snow cornice southbound. Did not see it again.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness on the phone and reviewing the photos that he provided via email, we made plans to meet at the sighting location, Mayflower Gulch, the Summit County site of the Boston Mining company encampment, which was at it\u0092s highest state of activity in the late 1880\u0092s.  On Monday, August 19, I drove to the sighting location with BFRO investigator Scott Walter.  We met the witness late morning at the main Mayflower Gulch parking lot on CO 91 about 5 miles south of Copper Mountain and a few miles north of Leadville.  We drove the short distance from the parking lot via Forest Service road back to the trailhead of Mayflower Gulch, and hiked less than a mile back into the gulch to the exact location that the witness had his sighting.  The sighting location is a high alpine valley dead-ending in a bowl with 12000 ft plus ridges around the south end.  We stood at the white rock mentioned by the witness where he was sitting when he saw the large figure about .2 miles away. Witness standing next to white rock and creature's position on Gold Hill ridge indicated by red arrow.  View is to the West.The witness gave a detailed account of the sighting on July 25, pointing out the exact locations of the creature, the nearby trail and grove of trees from which the other person mentioned in the report was hiking with his dog.  The witness\u0092 account at the location was consistent with the written report submitted and the phone conversation I had prior to meeting him at the location.  The distance from the witness to the top of the ridge-line where the creature was observed was, in my judgement, short enough to be able to accurately assess the size of the creature compared to other hikers on the trail or on the ridge.  At the time of the sighting there were no other hikers in the area other than the individual mentioned in the witness account.  But the area was pretty active when we met with the witness.  It was pretty easy to see people at the top of the ridge and at the exact location that the creature was seen.  The witness was very confident that the figure he saw was much bigger than a normal person and had a very large frame and consistent dark brown coloring.  He stated the individual he observed was approximately 2 feet taller and much stockier than an average human we saw hiking at the top of the ridge, known as Gold Hill.It was very easy to see how the witness\u0092 account would have played out.  The creature was likely flushed from cover in the grove of trees by the approaching hiker and his dog, and attempted to get to the top of the Gold hill ridge-line on the west side of the gulch.  Between the top of the ridge-line and the grove of trees, there was, at the time of the sighting, a very large snow drift.  The creature attempted to scale the overhanging cornice of snow, but due to the angle and the texture of the snow in mid-summer, it was apparently unable to get purchase, but left clear hand prints and some tracks, photos of which are included below.  Handprints and tracks with ski pole for reference.Closeup of handprints in snow.Head on view of snow cornice with handprints.The creature proceeded north laterally below the ridge-line to a point where it was able to clear the snow bank, and was then seen traveling south again on the Gold Hill ridge-line toward the trail up Mt Fletcher.After speaking with the witness at length, Scott W and I scaled the west ridge to survey the location where the creature was viewed and the surrounding area, including the ridge-line itself, which leads to the summit of Mt Fletcher, the approximately 12,500 foot peak overseeing Mayflower Gulch.  During our survey of the area, we did not find any definitive tracks and we did not see any evidence of deer or elk activity, which I thought unusual.  This area is adjoining several other high alpine valleys known to have seasonal elk, deer and mountain goat populations.  The area has several high-volume water sources and I would consider the area to be a viable Sasquatch habitat.Overall, Scott W and I were impressed with the witness\u0092 account and his knowledge of Colorado wilderness, wildlife and the area of the sighting.  He is a retired corporate executive with excellent communication and observational skills.  He has over 50 years of experience in the Colorado back country as a hunter, hiker and skier.  I believe that he saw exactly what he reported and was a witness to a Sasquatch, probably a young individual that accidentally (or naively) got caught in a compromising situation in the daytime in a fairly high-traffic area.",
