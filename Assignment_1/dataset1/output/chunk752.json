            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was getting estimates from a person from the power company, when he looked down in the powdery soil and noticed a large human-like print. He brought it to witness' attention and she was stunned by the size of the print.  He put his boot down next to the print and got an estimation of about a boot size 11.  \"But the weird thing about this print was that it was deep in the soil, we were making tracks but this thing was heavy, its track was well into the soil, as deep as the elk tracks that were next to it.\"\"I am not a tracker, but I followed these tracks for a bit and notice that the stride was longer than any persons.  At first, I thought it was my neighbors trying to scare me off the property but they would have to go to great strides and detail to pull this off.  There was no way that someone could have been pulling this joke off.\"\"At one time these tracks went to a viewpoint off the side of the road.\"  Q&A  Q:  What do you mean?A:  \u0093The tracks had a great stride to them and then the prints came together, like it stood in one spot and then looked out over the valley and then continued on down the road for a few more steps and then left the road and that is when I lost them.\u0094Q:  Any thing else you noticed?A:  \"Yeah, it walked through a bunch of sticker bushes or thistle bushes.  Why would it walk through that, when someone like me would just walk around them?  It was the strangest thing.\"Q:  Has anything else happened since you spotted the tracks?A:  \"One night a friend and I went up there and we slept in different tents.  In the middle of the night I heard something.\"Q:  What did you hear?A:  \"I heard something take in a lot of air around our campfire, it was almost out.\"Q:  Were you cooking anything at the time?A:  \"It was some time ago...let me think....  we had chili that night and rinsed out the cans and dumped the water around the fire.\u0094\u0093It could have been a bear or an elk, but this had a big chest cavity by the amounts of air I heard it take in.\"Q:  Do you still plan on building on the property?A:  \"Yes, I have been wanting to complete this project for awhile.\u0094Even though the witness was not sure about what she had heard the night she spent on the property.  The tracks she had seen years before were definitely not those of a bear or any other animal or human.",

The first thing I noticed were some unusual scrapings on some tree's, higher up than any animal found here. Really paid little to no attention to that until after the fact. I went further into a game trail and I heard a noise as if someone, or something was flanking me. It moved when I moved. As it grew darker I changed my direction and then began hearing a screech/growl that I was unfamilar with. Raised the hairs on my neck and I got out of there. I went home and told my wife and we laughed it off. I studied the satellite imagery for the area and chose a close by location for the following day.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness' encounters happened on two consecutive days during early evening and dusk while hunting hogs in Goethe State Forest. Witness (JR) has been hunting in the area for 20 years, though this was the first time at these exact spots.As he progressed on the first trail, he could hear branches and twigs popping as if something was keeping pace w/him in the dense brush to his left. After he continued down the trail, it let out a type of low growl/screech that he'd never heard before. JR left the area and went home.  When he returned the next evening, he tried a spot that he picked out on a satellite map the night before. As he was working his way in, he heard another growl/screech just off the trail to his left and a stick hitting a tree three times. He exited this area and drove to another approximately a half mile away that had a wider horse trail with a sandy base that reveals many horse, boot, and animal prints.As he progressed on the horse trail, he heard the same growl/screech noise to his right then another wood knocking to his left. JR thinks he may have been in between two of them. When he challenged the noise maker to come out, he heard a pounding that sounded like it was only 10 ft. from him in the dense brush. JR compared it to a horse stomping right next to him, only ten times louder. Then something was thrown past him which landed on the other side of the trail in the woods. He could hear it travel through the brush and land on the other side. Then he heard crunching bushes and breaking branches as if something was angry and he ran back towards his car.Along the trail he discovered a very large bare footprint that was approximately twice his boot size of 14. He snapped a photo of the print with his cell phone and continued his run to his car. As JR approached his car, he could hear an animal breaking through the brush 30 ft. from him. He exited the area and will not return alone. It's difficult to take a clearly discernible photo of a track under the best of conditions. JR's cell phone photo of the track as he was hastily returning to his vehicle turned out to be an indiscernible blur.  ",
