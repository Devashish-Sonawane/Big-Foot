We lease some of the property for hunting and riding our ATV's. It was mid day on a Sunday. Me and my husband were on his ATV going to check on a trail camera he had put out a couple days before. It takes a while to get to the location of the camera. The terrain is very unforgiving. We had stopped in the holler and the camera was on top of the ridge. My husband walked up to the camera to where I couldn't see or hear him anymore. I was sitting on the four wheeler in total silence. All of the sudden I heard this horn like yell. It sounded like a cross between a man yelling as loud as he could and a horn blowing. It wasn't extremely loud. I just sat there on the four wheeler. I couldn't process what I had just heard. I am constantly in the woods and have seen and heard every animal that is in these parts of the woods, and I've never heard anything like that before. When my husband got back to the four wheeler about 10 minutes later I asked him if he heard that and he said he didn't. There is a train near that area, but I work right beside train tracks and I know what sounds a train makes and this was not a train.",
