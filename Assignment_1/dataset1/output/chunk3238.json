            "Observed": "I was sitting in my mother's kitchen with 2 of my nieces and my mother when I happened to look out of her back door. I clearly saw a very tall (approximately 7 feet) creature moving on two legs at an extremely rapid pace through the weeds bordering on her yard. I yelled \"My God, what is that?\" One of my nieces standing near the door whirled around and also saw the creature. After a few seconds of stunned silence we went into the back yard and saw the creature, now in the yard itself, dash behind a storage building. I remember being very afraid, as was everyone else, so we did not pursue whatever this was. As I said this creature was walking on 2 legs, was approximately 7 feet tall, covered with very dark brown or black hair. The creature was walking at a stunningly rapid pace with it's shoulders hunched forward. As this thing was moving away from us we did not see any facial features but the head appeared rounded. We did not see this thing any more and assumed that it had stepped over a fence behind the storage building and preceded into the fields and woods. We were struck with how rapidly this thing was moving and were amazed that it had eluded us with such apparent ease. When first spotted the creature was approximately 80-100 feet from the back door. When observed in the yard itself it was approximately 150 feet away. We were too shaken to look for tracks and were actually afraid to go into the yard for a long time afterwards.",
