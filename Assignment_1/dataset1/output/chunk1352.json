            "Follow-Up Report": "In the summer of 1976 or 77 between 10 and 11 o\u0092clock the witness who was 17 or 18 years old and his two friends went to the location and parked their Chevy Cheyenne pickup. The vehicle was facing south. After being there 20 minutes they begin to casually throw rocks at the street light. Most of the rocks landed in the woods. The rocks they threw were potato size rocks and would make good size knocks when they would hit trees.The witness and his friends heard 3 \u0096 4 knocks 200 yards to the northeast. At that point the knocks were such a non-event that they didn\u0092t say anything but looked at each other with quizzical looks and continued on. A few minutes later there were 3 \u0096 4 knocks 100 yards away. They looked at each other and asked each other what is that? Whatever was doing the knocking was moving in a southwesterly direction to their position. The 3 \u0096 4 knock sets lasted 1.5 to 2 seconds. The witness said, \u0093it sounded like wood hitting wood and that the wood was bare\u0094, no bark. The knocks were loud and resonated like clunking two pieces of aged firewood together hard.The last set of 3 \u0096 4 knocks were 30 \u0096 60 yards away from them. They looked at each other and just ran for the pickup. The witness said that they really didn\u0092t want to wait and see what was going to come out of the woods, plus they were throwing rocks at the street light. He said they looked out the back window and nothing came out of the woods into the light of the street light.The witness explained how you could tell that knocking sound was made by hitting two pieces of wood together or swinging a piece of wood against another. There isn\u0092t an animal that can do that. He emphasized the unlikelihood that it was a person doing the knocking. The first set of knocks would have had to come from an area down an 80+ foot almost vertical bluff. He explained, it would be a feat to climb it during the day and impossible to climb in the dark.Whatever it was didn\u0092t make any noise moving through the woods with moderate thick understory. The witness explained that it would be strange for a person or persons to move through the woods and not make any noise or use any lights because the woods were so dark. They didn\u0092t hear any talking or laughing.They came in on the only road to the area and they didn\u0092t see anyone or any vehicles. The area was scrub land and didn\u0092t have anything that was developed and no reason any one would be lying in wait for some unsuspecting teenagers to scare.The witness has 40+ years of hunting experience and has never heard anything like that in all of his years of hunting. To this day, he and his friends still reminisce about the night that they heard the knocks and ran out of fear of something that didn\u0092t fit any reasonable explanation.The location in the early 60s was a farm, by the 70s the property had been obtained by eminent domain and allowed to grow wild. From satellite images (1963) it appears the farm might have been an apple orchard and has been verified by one of the witnesses that in the 60\u0092s it was a working apple farm. The area then and now was allowed to revert to its natural state. In the 70s, Bender Park was just a foot path going down to the lake and not the developed boat landing that it is now. Even though the area is surrounded by sparsely developed neighborhoods there are corridors that something could use to make its way to the area unhindered or hampered. There are two recent cases from far outer suburbs of Dallas and Atlanta that have had activity in areas more developed than in this case. One trait that shares commonality with all three instances is that there was a corridor of woods leading in and out of the area. Waterways can also be considered corridors that they would use too. The Dallas case is an on going area of research and can\u0092t be disclosed. The Georgia incident can be viewed on Finding Bigfoot Episode 1, 'Bigfoot Crossing in Georgia' or on YouTube by using the search term: \"Georgia police camera video\" ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This investigator gained permission from this teenage witness' father to conduct a telephone interview on 9/4/08. The father recalled that the witness was \"freaked out\" by what he had heard, and told the father about the event that day. -The witness stated that his dogs were \"going crazy\", early in the morning and he went outside to check them out and calm them down. -He stated that he heard relatively loud growling across the road and across a small vacant lot, coming from the woods beyond. He stated that it was louder than, and deeper than gator growls that he was familiar with. He described them as, \"pretty loud\".  -He stated that this was followed by knocking sounds, like a bat hitting a tree.-This was followed by lower volume growling, according to the witness, followed by no other sounds. -Growing up in a hunting family, the witness stated that he was familiar with wild hog sounds and that this was NOT a hog sound. -He acknowledged hearing knocking sounds on one other occasion in the area, several months before, but thought nothing of it. This witness' father was interviewed extensively following the interview with the witness, and based on his responses to inquiries; it is the conviction of this investigator that this may have been a Class B encounter, based on the report, and the frequency of other reports in the same area.",
