            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a forty-year-old concrete boom pump operator in Las Vegas, Nevada.At the time of the sighting, he was a boy living with his family in an apartment above a farmhouse on a Connecticut dairy farm where his father worked.Somewhere between two and four o\u2019clock one cloudy November day, the witness stood at a second floor hallway window and watched as a bigfoot crossed his front yard.  It walked in a diagonal direction towards the house, from left to right, coming from the direction of a road in front of the house about 100 feet away.  On this side of the road was a five-foot high stone retaining wall, which the bigfoot had to have come over if it had indeed come from across the road.  It moved uphill at a very fast pace, as the witness described it, \u201cswinging its arms enormously as it walked.\u201d  The witness said that, although it was taller and thinner, it walked like the bigfoot in Roger Patterson\u2019s film.  As it moved across the yard, three times it turned its upper body and looked back, as if it was watching for something.When the bigfoot was 60 to 70 feet away, it looked up and, for a second, made eye contact with the witness.  The witness noticed that the bigfoot\u2019s large eyes had a bright, eerie yellow glow to them, like an animal caught in a car\u2019s headlights at night.As the bigfoot continued moving, the witness pressed his face against the window so he could watch it as it disappeared around the corner of the house.  The entire sighting lasted five or six seconds.Five or ten minutes after the sighting, two rifle-toting neighbors showed up at the farmhouse, asking if anybody had seen anything.  They appeared to be scared and panicky as they asked \"What did it look like?\"The witness and his father climbed into the car and drove down the road for about a half-mile, where they met up with their friend, who had been tracking the footprints across fields and over several more stone walls.  He had followed them up over yet another wall, where they crossed a clearing and disappeared into the forest.  Faced with the prospect of having to enter the forest to continue tracking, he ended the chase with \"Let's get the hell out of here.\"Comparing the height of the animal to nearby trees, the witness estimates that it was eight to nine feet tall.  It was lanky but muscular, and covered with black hair that was thin and sparse, as if it was shedding.  Its face was hairy, with skin of a \u201ctannish\u201d yellow color, and a flat, \u201cmushed out\u201d nose.  A dome shaped head sat atop a thick, short neck.  The bigfoot \u201clooked more humanlike than monkeylike.\u201dThe witness is unsure as to the length of the footprints; they could have been about seventeen inches long and six inches wide.  The stride was at least six feet long, based on an attempt to duplicate it.  The footprints went around the farmhouse, through an open gate in the back, and across a plowed cornfield.While watching the bigfoot, the witness felt fear only after it disappeared around the corner of the house.  Although he remarked that \u201cThe sighting is stuck in my mind,\u201d since then he has not experienced any adverse psychological effects from it, although when he goes camping and four-wheeling he says that he \u201calways thinks about it.\u201dThe witness describes the area as heavily forested with pine, maple, oak, ash, birch, willows, and scattered scrub brush, broken by areas cleared for growing crops.  The forest is not particularly thick, however, and can be seen through for some distance, especially in the winter.Regarding the bigfoot\u2019s eyes, the witness said that they glowed yellow for the entire time he watched the animal, but that they glowed the brightest when it looked directly at him.Bigfoot eyeshine is a fairly common phenomenon in bigfoot sightings.  What makes this sighting uncommon is that, in this case, the bigfoot\u2019s eyes glowed in the daytime. Although most of the BFRO\u2019s scientists believe bigfoot eyeshine, or eye glow, is a reflection of light, reports do exist where witnesses have described seeing this phenomenon in conditions of total darkness, where there is no apparent light to reflect.A quick search of the BFRO database turned up two California reports where the witnesses described seeing bigfoot with yellow eyes:  Report 615  and Report 913.  The bigfoot in the second report, Report 913, also had yellowish facial skin, similar to the bigfoot seen by the witness of this report thirty-two years before, and over two thousand miles away.",

The hill he spoke of was very steep and he was standing very still when he heard what he assumed to be another soldier.  He is very certain that it walked on two legs. The recently logged hill was very sandy. Along with hearing the footsteps he also heard the dirt move with each rapid step.  At the time he had never heard of bigfoots, so the growl made him assume it had to be a bear.  His buddies had to be told something because he returned very scared. There were no sounds to indicate something was chasing him.  He only heard his own breath and heart beating as he ran back to his Company.  No unusual smells. He did not return to the area to look for tracks. He was from New York and 19 years-old at the time.  Currently lives in Florida and has been a law-enforcement officer over 30 years. Very credible witness.",
