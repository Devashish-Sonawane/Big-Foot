            "Observed.1  ": "The report came from a man living on Burnt Mountain Road in this community, about 30 miles northeast of Forks. The man, whose name was not released, said he spotted the hairy, humanlike creature near his house Monday. An animal control officer checked the area but found no signs of the creature. That took the burden of figuring out how to deal with such a discovery off local law-enforcement officers, Powell said Friday. \"I don't know why we would impound him or where we would keep him,\" he said. Sightings of the creature, reputed to lurk in the shadowy Pacific Northwest forest, are rare, but Monday's wasn't the first in the area. In June 2000, Gene Sampson found two sets of large footprints in the woods behind his home and that of a neighbor on the Hoh Indian reservation. Sampson also reported finding trampled trails in a densely forested area, with branches and bark broken off trees about 20 feet up.",
