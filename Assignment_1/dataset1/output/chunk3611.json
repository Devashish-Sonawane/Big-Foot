It is especially peaceful during the offseason and I used to like to camp there on weekends from about early May to mid-June. During these times it is dead quiet at night and I heard wood knocks several times (sound really carries due to the large lake surrounded by mountains and hills). At the time I thought it was interesting, but made no connection to Sasquatch. After reading reports on this site I now think the sounds are more interesting.",
