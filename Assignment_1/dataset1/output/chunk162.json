            "Follow-Up Report": "I conducted a 45 minute phone interview with Mike, and he restated the events of June 20th as reported above. He was also able to provide me with some additional information regarding the events leading up to his encounter, and also following it. We made plans to meet at the location in order to do a full recreation of the encounter, and to learn more details. Fellow NJ BFRO investigators Art Mack and Heather Pacetti joined me with the recreation on site, and Mike was waiting for us when we arrived. After introductions I hopped into Mike's SUV and we began the recreation. I had my GoPro on the dashboard, and my H2n digital recorder going, and maintained radio contact with Art and Heather. We did one pass with the vehicle and determined that Heather needed to be a bit closer to the side of the road on the return portion, so we proceeded to do a second pass.Initially when Mike was driving down the road he was looking to the right, and caught a glimpse of what he thought was a groundhog, but then turned his head to look left just as the individual stood up. His immediate thought was \"That's one huge groundhog!\" then as he kept driving he began questioning what it was, and battled with the decision to turn around or to keep going. He decided to use the next available spot to turn around, and after checking that no oncoming cars were approaching, he headed back to where he spotted it. He rounded the bend and about 70 yards ahead of him was the juvenile bigfoot standing on the side of the road facing him. When he got to about 35 yards away he locked eyes with it, and was able to see only dark brown eyes - No whites of the eyes, and that's when it turned and took off running in the direction of the swamp. He slowed his vehicle to almost a stop by where it was standing only moments before, and saw it go behind some bushes. He then turned his vehicle around again and pulled up to the parking area on the right and stopped. He waited a few minutes, but could no longer see it so he left.After we did the recreation, we took measurements of the individual's height and shoulder width, and determined that it was closer to 4ft tall and about 18in across the shoulders and chest. He described the arms as thin, the chest not overly developed, and the legs were stockier, more muscular. He also confirmed that the hair was more auburn in color and about 3-4 inches in length. He mentioned how we had severe storms move through the area that evening and how they were moving in an easterly direction as to hamper his commute from work. He was surprised to see that the fur appeared to be dry, but somewhat matted.I found Mike to be a credible witness and he was very clear with his reporting of the events. He previously had not been into the Bigfoot phenomenon and had not even seen an episode of Finding Bigfoot. He really thought he would hear that some kid in a Halloween costume went missing in the area but after a few days without seeing any reports of one he realized that he had seen a juvenile bigfoot. A rare sight to see indeed, and meeting with us helped to validate his experience.The area where this occurred is a former cranberry bog land that has now been preserved by the State for recreational use. It is rich in flora and fauna, and has numerous lakes and streams. It is an area that I have conducted research in for over the past decade, and I recorded my first wood knocks and found my first juvenile track impressions nearby. We stayed after Mike left, and conducted further research near the location. We used a Phantom 4 drone to conduct aerial surveillance of the area as well as thermal imagery. We were able to elicit responses from coyotes and barred owls, and also recorded some higher pitched screams that may have been a fox or maybe even a sasquatch.",

While watching, Dan F. noticed a human-like creature walking in the street in front of my house.  From the living room window, we all observed a creature which appeared to be just under six feet tall walking away from my house.  The creature was about 150 feet away and passed under a street light, which gave us the ability to get a decent look at it.  It was long limbed, but clearly not human.  Because of the lighting it was in silhouette, but we could see that it was covered with hair.  It was walking with its shoulders hunched forward, and did not appear to be in any distress.  We watched it pass from view as it went behind trees and into the woods on the far side of the street.",
