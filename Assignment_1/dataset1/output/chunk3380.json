            "Follow-Up Report": "March 5, 2010 I contacted the witness by phone. We spoke for approximately 45 minutes. A day was set up to meet at the witness' home to look the area over.March 14, 2010 I met with him at his home and he showed me the the area of the sighting. The time of the sighting was approximately 1 pm and lasted for approximately 10 seconds.  He noticed deer running at a high rate of speed from the NE to SW at approximately 75 to 100 yards from his home. In trail, he noticed this much larger brown bipedal \"animal\" chasing the deer.  Also noticed was the fast fluid gate of this bipedal animal.  I asked if it could have been a person flushing the deer, and considering the terrain and the gait and the fact it was keeping up with the deer he was sure it was not a person.Also noted there are many game trails in the area. The terrain is thick with plenty of dead fall around. The Rock River is within a half mile of this location and heavily wooded with some farming areas nearby.More information on the casting of footprints found in the area referenced by this witness can be read in our Media Article #598.I found the witness to be credible and sincere with what he saw.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness over the phone for approximately 45 minutes. I found him to be very sincere about his experiences. He said after the latest incident he felt compelled to submit a report. The witness relayed the following to me:Incident #1On Labor Day weekend in 2012 he was camping at Turner Flat Campground right along the St. Joe River. He was camped in spot #1 which is closest to the St. Joe River Road. It was around 7:00-7:30 in the evening and a fellow camper had been chopping wood for his campfire. About 10 minutes after the chopping had stopped this witness heard 2 loud and distinct wood knock sounds coming from across the road and up the hill which is away from the other campers. He described the knocks as having more resonance than the sound of chopping wood. He walked up to and down road while scanning the hillside. The witness then described seeing a large dark face looking at him from a gap in the brush on the hillside. He said they had eye contact for approximately a minute before he retreated back to his campsite to retrieve a firearm. He went back to the location where he saw the face and it was gone. When I asked the witness to describe what he saw his first words were \"Big eyes, big face\". Upon further questioning he advised he was not close enough to see details, but the head was big, dark colored, oval shaped and had dark eyes. He went up to the location the next morning to check for footprints. He didn't find any prints, but standing on his tip toes he could look through the gap in the brush where he saw the face. From this vantage point he could see down into the campground. Incident #2This is the latest incident which prompted this report. On August 8th, 2020 the witness was camping in an undeveloped campsite approximately 2.6 miles east of the first incident as the crow flies. This site was across the road from the river on the hillside. It was approximately 9:30 p.m. and he was listening to some classic rock over a small bluetooth speaker. The witness heard 3 loud whoops from the hillside above and to the east of him. He described the whoops as being drawn out sounding. He said he immediately knew a human didn't make that sound and that there was no one camped near him. He said he turned off his speaker and listened, but there was no more vocalizations. He told me he decided to make a whooping sound back, but there was no answer and it was quiet the rest of the night. This witness seemed genuinely unnerved by the latest incident. I am familiar with this area and it is rugged country. Any sounds coming from the north of the last campsite is extremely unlikely to come from a human source since it is nothing but steep forested terrain. The witness told me he had been camping in the St. Joe National Forest for the last 20 years and these are the only two encounters that he could not contribute to any of the known local wildlife. ",
