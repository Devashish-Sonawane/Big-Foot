            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was interviewed in detail by phone.  The witness was a passenger in the car driven by her mother and was traveling approximately 40 mph when it passed the crouched animal with its back to the road approximately 10-20 ft off the passenger side of the road.  They continued approximately \u00bc mile down the road, turned around and started back to the area of the sighting moving at a slower speed of 25-30 mph.  Their car continued past the point of the first sighting at which point another car was noticed approaching from the other direction.In the headlights of both cars, the witness described seeing a bi-pedal animal cross the road approximately 150 feet in front of their car, moving from left to right.  She described the creature as moving at a fast walk, slightly hunched forward and having a pointed head, unusually long arms with hair on its back, chest and upper thighs. She also described the animal as having an athletic build and weighing at least 400 lbs. The animal did not turn its head toward either car while crossing and appeared to be carrying root-like objects in its left hand. When the creature reached the other side of the road, it briefly stopped and looked left and right and then disappeared into the tall bushes.  The animal was not observed by the time the car passed the point where the animal had entered the bushes.  They continued up the road and then turned around and started back in the original direction they were headed and do not see anything further. The next morning the witness and mother returned to the point of the sighting where the creature was first spotted crouching by the road.  The witness looked around the area and noticed that the ground had been dug up and described it as looking similar to what a wild pig may do when feeding on plants and roots.  She also noticed several broken branches about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter about 4-5\u0092 off the ground.  No footprints were observed and the witness commented that it had rained late the previous night and into that morning.The witness lives approximately 10 miles from the area of the sighting and travels this same road 3-4 times a week. A Union Pacific railroad line runs parallel to the road. The area of the sighting is fairly rural with forested hardwoods and pines with sporadic swamps and farmland on both sides of the road.  The witness spends a lot of time outdoors hunting and fishing and is familiar with the indigenous animals of the area. ",
