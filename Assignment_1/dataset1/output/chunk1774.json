They went to this same spot on an almost weekly basis to fish and would catch big cat fish. This night it was a nice, cool about 70s summer night with a full moon. As they were there fishing they all of a sudden heard this loud guttural human scream that lasted for five seconds. Then  a pack of coyotes sounded off howling and yelping after the scream. Sounded like they were within a mile away from their fishing spot. The witness and buddies all asked one another what was that? And no one had a clue. Witness has went to college with study in wildlife and nature. Knows the sounds of wolves and coyotes and the scream that set the coyotes off had not been heard other than in the studies as the 1994 Ohio Moaning Howl. Each time they have been to this favorite spot to fish they had experienced sometimes feeling as they were being watched as they were fishing and other times like everything was normal. One time in the wooded area could see a tree with some branches that were intertwined making a teepee structure shape. This area is all wooded and fields with few homes along the gravel roads. I find the witness to be creditable.",
