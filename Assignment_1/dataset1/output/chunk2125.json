            "Follow-Up Report": "In accordance with the BFRO Classification System, this report is a Class B until such time as I speak with the other family members.  As the witness is relaying information from family members, which he found believable, and was credible during the interview, this report does merit inclusion in the BFRO database available to the public.  I do hope to speak with the family witnesses, especially the brother, in the future.  I have also requested the assistance of the witness in getting permission to enter the property.  The witness has relocated to the western U.S. since the time of these incidents.Full growth Ohio corn is quite tall, seven feet at a minimum would be a reasonable estimate .  It would provide good cover in the late summer as one can only see five to ten feet into a field most times from adjoining roads.  Corn would also be a plentiful food source.  The mother's height estimate of eight feet, and the ability to see eye shine above the level of the corn, are consistent in my opinion.There is also an old quarry in proximity to the area where these events happened.  The witness was surprised to learn of the number of Ohio reports where a quarry is a nearby land feature.While adjoining counties have had reports, especially those to the east, this is the first report I am aware of for Huron County.  Huron County is a largely rural area, comprised of crop fields and some fairly large woods.  The terrain in the eastern portions of the county would be characterized as rolling with small creeks and rivers.6/9/05 - These comments were submitted to the BFRO, they are added here for informational purposes.Hello, My name is B. B., I am the lady who awhile back reported an incident I witnessed years ago in Preston County West Virginia. Rec'd a call from a gentleman from your org a few months ago, etc.My comment is regarding the recent class B report from Huron county OH. I live just outside Savannah Ohio which is about 10-12 minutes south of New London Ohio. Rt 60 S. to 250. I have lived in Ashland County almost all of my life, and Northern Ashland county for the last Ten years. I have heard tree knocks here, living on our family farm (located on US 42 between Ashland OH and West Salem OH (Wayne Co) not knowing what they were then as I was a child.My former boss relayed that he was outside doing yard work at his home on Rt 545 just south of Savannah OH years back, and he saw a \"Big Monkey\" looking at him from the trees. You can have his phone number if you want it to corroberate what I'm telling you. (He may not like telling it, but he is a truthful man.) Living here all these years, I can tell you that almost all of this area is prime territory for any predator as there is a large abundance of cover, water, farm animals, wildlife,let's not forget the HUGE deer population, orchards, alot of wild berries of every kind, etc. and although houses are being built on a regular basis out here, development is still pretty sparse. Anything could live out here, and if it were primarily nocturnal, without much interference from people. Alot of folks farm, but alot of property is un-used or densely wooded. Large tracts, hundreds of acres that are just divided up by a dirt road or two. I hope you will have someone look further into this area, and ask around. You may find out that more people know about bigfoot here but are just not talking about it. Farmers especially. Reputation and integrity mean more than money here. And everyone knows everyone. If farmer Joe spots a big hairy monster and tells farmer John, everyone at the weekly tractor auction will think farmer Joe suddenly a liar or has lost his reasoning. I'm sure it's like that everywhere you go. Thanks for your consideration. Thank you B.B. for the comment, we do hope to look further into the area and see what we can find if we can secure access from property owners.Another person has been prompted to send in a report from this general area.  The report does not include any specific sighting; it is about a gate being broken open and some vocalizations around the same timeframe as this report.  The property is located approximately 10 miles to the south and the east of this report.  The double width gate, although five years older, is substantial with an electrified line running at the top of it, just under 48 inches from ground level.  The hardware of the hinges and the two tubular sliding latches are also of solid construction, for something or someone to tear this gate apart it would take considerable force.  All of the hardware showed that the gate was opened by force and not by manipulating the latches.  The witness reported that he could not find tire marks, chain marks or other evidence that would lead him to believe it was the work of vandals, not to mention the gates were left laying in opposite directions.  The following paragraph is from his report submission, which has been evaluated as Class C.  I interviewed this family and also visited the property and found them credible.  There may be a logical, ordinary explanation to what this witness found, but he and I eliminated most on the basis of how most farm animals react to electrified fencing, the solid construction of the gate, the condition of the gates when he found them and the lack of any evidence of vehicles being involved.I was coming home from work and as I past My side field, I noticed the rear gate, which led to the rear of the farm appeared to have been left open. My wife had been dumping manure back there on the pile a couple times a week. Naturally, I assumed she had accidently left the gate open. When I got into the house and told her, she informed me that she hadn't dumped that day. So I trudged out there and as I got close, I was amazed that the gates were mangled and flipped off their hinges. These gates are electrified, as well as the fencing, to keep predators out and the livestock in. I have seen deer on many occasions jump this fence with ease and I have heard coyotes and stray dogs touch it at night and howl themselves as they'd take off. As I came up to these mangled gates, My first impression was that \"Something touched the wires and snapped in anger.\" One gate was \"thrown\" forward and the other one was swung back so hard that it ripped the screws out on the hinge. The second thought I had was that if I lived in the Pacific Northwest that it would have had to have been Bifoot. At that time, that's the only place that I had known of them to be seen. So I dimissed this as ridiculous and assumed that a deer must have got snagged somehow, because I had found some reddish brown hair on the fence. I thought at the time the hair was a little too long and soft to be from a deer. But, you got to remember, I didn't believe there were any bigfoot around here. About a year ago, I finally got a computer and came across your site. I check it regulary and did some research only to discover other sightings(A&B) around here. Most recenctly #11248 with the addition of the Savannah incidents. I've wanting to write you, but, did a \"wait and see\". I felt that it was time, at least to add credence to the other stories I read. Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you, those gates had steel slides and straps that were snapped off to. I'm supprised the livestock didn't go out that gate.",
