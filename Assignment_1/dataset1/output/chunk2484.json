            "Observed": "I was driving on Rd 1 in Salt Fork State Park from the back entrance. I was around 30 yards from the turn off for Hosak's Cave when I saw a hairy, brown figure move into the brush on the right side of the road. Now I know what a deer backside looks like and it wasn't a bear. When I went back later after work is when we found a foot print.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Received notification of encounter from BFRO investigator, Marc DeWerth.  Contacted witness 2-16-17 by phone. Listened to her account and she reported there was a possible foot print on site. Arranged for a meeting at the site on 2-19-17.  Requested assistance from fellow BFRO Investigator, Mark Maisel, due to his valuable knowledge of previous Salt Fork sightings.  Met she her husband and son at the parking lot of Hosak's Cave. She went over her sighting as follows:  She lives nearby and drives to Salt Fork Lodge for work. She was driving south bound on Route 1, just before the Hosak's Cave turn off.  Speed limit was 35 mph.  She was driving a car.  She was startled to see a large, hunched over hairy figure standing on the right berm. She did not see its face.  It did not turn to look at her.  \"Like it did not care that I was there\". The hair was long and brown in color. The whole encounter lasted about 10 seconds. She estimated the height somewhere between 7-8', but really had no fixed object to relate to and its body position was hunched over.  She reports after work she took her daughter to the site and they found a footprint in the dirt/gravel.  The weather on 2-12-17 was particularly warm and rainy for February. There was no snow on the ground.We walked over to the site and was able to locate one foot print. It was a left foot print facing north. Pictures and measurement were taken. We did a grid search and was unable to discover any other prints. We made a cast of the print using hydro-cal and continue to investigate the site. The site was off the road embankment. with a stream and beaver sign.  No other trail sign was found but at the bottom of the drop off there was multi-flora rose bushes that could have offered some cover.  Multiple times we questioned the events and details but she was consistent with every detail and did not embellish.  I found the witness to be truthful and consistent in her recalling of her experience.  The story was basic in details but supported strongly with the uniqueness for the foot casting. The Salt fork area has a strong history of reliable accounts and the wildlife abundance and terrain offers many resources.  Cast was pulled later that day. It clearly showed the first toe (big toe).  Total length was 12\", with forefoot 5\" and heel approximately 4\" (some sediment had settled, unable to obtain true measurement).  The greatest depth was 2 1/2 \" on the lateral side and 1\" depth on the medial side.  There is evidence of a mid-tarsal break. Photos of the cast:Highlighted footprint from cast:Depth on lateral side:Width across ball of foot:Width across heel, true shape lost in degradation of sediment:We revisited the site of the footprint in May.  We had a friend, who is 6' 5\" and 340 lbs jump barefooted behind where the original was cast. He could only make about 1/2 inch impression. I know there is a lot of factors for a true comparison.  But it really helped me to realize just how much more massive there weight can be. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After talking with the witness, many more details came forth.  He and three of his friends were out riding in his truck and shining deer.  They had traveled south on Summit City Road and continued south on No. 31 Road all the way to the river, shining as they traveled.  They hadn't seen any animals on their way to the river, so they turned around to come back up No. 31 Road, continuing to shine for deer with their spotlight.  As they came around a curve, they shined over into a field that was about 300 yards wide and 100 yards deep.  At first, all they saw were two amber colored eyes.  They were an amber color, but the eyes were not reflecting like a deer or any other animal they were familiar with.  The witness couldn't explain the difference, but he stated that the eyes just looked different than other animal eyes that reflect light. Then the teens noticed that the eyes belonged to something big, crouching in the field.  They watched for about one minute, until it stood up.  At that point, the teens were so afraid that the witness jammed the gas pedal to the floor to get out of there.  The animal ran toward the truck, diagonally across the field and by the time the truck reached a residence, it was within ten feet of the truck.  The witness said that he had reached at least 30 mph by the time it caught up with them.  \"I have never seen anything run that fast in my life?  That thing came running toward us faster than any man could run.  The strides were three times a normal man's stride!\"  At that point, it disappeared into the tree line.  The witness described it as having very long arms, and it was \"like his arms swung with mechanical control as if the creature realized there was a specific way for his arms to swing to run that fast!\"  The witness also described hearing \"heavy breathing as the creature started running\" and its footfalls like those of \"a pack of horses!\"  All the noise from the gravel road and the speeding of the truck made too much noise to hear anything else. The witness did say that he felt the charge was a territorial statement rather than a direct threat on them.  All the teens came away from the incident deeply frightened and wondering about what really is out in the woods!The witness described the creature as at least 8 feet tall and more than 400 lbs.  The body was covered with matted, rusty brown colored hair and a shoulder width about 4 - 5 feet wide.  The body of the creature was bulky and massive.  He \u0093has never gone back to that area\u0094 and he will \u0093not go into the woods without carrying some type of protection.\u0094  He also stated that he makes certain he is out of the woods before nightfall.  The three friends that were with him do not talk about this incident, but they feel the same way about being in the woods.  The one friend who is female will not go outside after dark unless she is with someone else.  When this incident first occurred, they did share the story with some friends and the friends divided them up into different rooms for questioning.  All their stories described the same scenario.  The river mentioned is the Manistee River, one of the finest steelhead, salmon, and trout rivers in the Great Lakes area. ",
