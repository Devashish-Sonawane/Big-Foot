We had driven by 4X4 truck for approx. 2 miles back in from the highway. We wanted to be alone, away from a formal camping area as we had firearms and planned on doing some \"plinking\".",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On the evening of April 22, 2005, Michael called me, and we went over his encounter on the Kern Plato that took place 20 years ago.  My first question to Mike was, why this series of screams and growls were still so prevalent in his mind?  He told me, that both he and his friend felt like they were both physically and psychologically affected by what they had heard that night.  I took that to be, that they were scared to death by what they heard and felt because it caused them both armed, and in excellent physical condition to act in different ways than usual/normal. They both took their guns to bed with them, and Mike\u0092s friend felt he should sleep in the back of the truck.  The next day, he revealed that he had heard something walking around and through the camp after they had been in their bedrolls for a while.  Mike was sleeping on the ground close to the fire which burned most of the night, but he never heard what it was that was walking around their campground. Per Mike, \u0093The temperature continued to drop throughout the night and he figured it was in the low teens by morning because a small running stream was frozen over by morning. It was way too cold for someone out there to be messing around in their opinion.  \"We both really wanted to leave, but were too tired from the previous days experiences, plus the long drive we had that day.\u0094 Mike remembered at least five screaming/growls that had a duration that lasted between 5 to 15 seconds each, and he figured it was emanating approximately a half mile away but  moving closer as the evening progressed. The volume was extremely loud, like it was coming from something very large.  Towards the end of screaming/growls it sounded to them like whatever it was making these noises was going to attack them, and at that time they felt a strong desire to leave the area immediately.  Summary: The reason that I think this report is relevant to the subject at hand, is the sensation that they both felt a fear to flee or fight vibration, and they noticed how the forest around them all went silent.  The screams were blood curdling, and the vibrations were very evident, they said,  which spooked  both of them to their core.  Michael is a highly educated person, and holds a high position in his industry.  He appeared to be a very credible person when recounting his encounter.",
