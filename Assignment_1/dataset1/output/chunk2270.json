The junkyard was in an open area that was surrounded by a house and woods to the west, a rarely used railroad to the north, another house and Riley Rd to the south, and a very dense swamp to the east. I should note that the two houses were not easily visible from the junkyard: they were about 100 yards or more away. The junkyard was closest to the railroad and the swamp. The entire surrounding area was very sparsely populated--mostly woods and swamp.",
