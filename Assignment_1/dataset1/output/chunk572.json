            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness \"RP\" over the phone on 1/30/15 and received more information than was initially given in the report.\"RP\" has hiked this trail on a number of occasions.  On a trip last year, while at the trail head making preparations to return home, two men came running off the trail into the parking area.  They approached and asked him if he had \"seen or heard anything strange.\"  He replied in the negative and in the ensuing conversation, these two identified themselves as \"Bigfoot hunters.\"  They then departed.During this hike toward the end of October, \"RP\" was anxious to camp with a new tent he purchased for these back-country adventures.  He arrived at the trail head to find he was apparently the only person in the area as no other cars were present.  He hiked in and went about setting up his camp in a clearing approximately 20 -25' in diameter, gathering firewood, and singing songs.  At no time did he see or hear signs of other people in the area.  At approximately 1:30AM he stepped out of the tent to answer the call of nature and was accompanied by his dog.  He was standing outside his tent when he was startled by a very loud sound that he describes as \"very similar to the start-up of an air-raid siren.\"  He is very familiar with this particular sound as his place of employment uses such a siren for alarms.  \"RP\" stated the \"call\" lasted for 4 - 5 seconds and was immediately followed by 3 \"whoops.\"  These all came from a location estimated at 70 feet from him, far enough inside the tree line that he could not see the source, but close enough that he could \"feel\" the force of it.  \"RP\" further said that he noticed his dog (half Rhodesian Ridgeback, a breed once used for hunting lions) appeared to be \"stunned\" by the vocalizations, which was an unusual response.  With nothing else occurring, he and his dog went back inside the tent and eventually fell asleep.  In the morning he packed up and left.Two weeks later,  \"RP\" returned to the location to look for prints or tracks.  In his line of work and as a member of a specialty team, he has been trained in tracking people.  Focusing in on the area where he thought the calls came from, he found an imprint with 5 toes, that resembled a human foot.  He didn't measure it but did compare it to his own foot and estimated the length at 12 - 13\".  He believes it could have been made by a hiker wearing the toed, form-fitting type of footwear. As a side-note, while researching the history of Lake Janus, I found an internet page asking the question; \"is Lake Janus Haunted?\"  There were several replies to this ascribing a \"spooky feel to the place.\"",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with the witness and she seems very credible. Her husband was also a witness. April 20th:They arrived at the Bear Paw rental cabin near Leavenworth, WA. on April 20th. The weather was hot and clear. My research confirms moon phase was a Waxing Gibbous.The cabin sits higher up on a hill than the ones around it. There are 2 hills in the back that form a \"V\" shape down to the bottom behind the cabin. They went to bed around 10:30pm. The witness described hearing one loud distinct wood knock. April 21st:Weather was 70 degrees or so. Sunny. They were sitting in the hot tub and playing some jazz music a bit loud and she heard 2 loud distinct wood knocks she believes were within 50 feet or so of the hills behind the cabin. They went to bed around 10pm and around 10:30pm a large rock hit the side of the bedroom wall. They were sleeping in separate rooms due to bad matress and a large rock hit the side of the cabin on her husband's bedroom wall. The husband said he could hear something rustling loudly in the woods behind the cabin. He looked and saw two deer come to the base of the \"V\" made by the hills then \"bolt\" back the way they came as if spooked. April 22nd:That morning the witness found a few rocks on top of the soil while the others were inbedded from sitting so long.Around 8:30pm they were sitting inside and she had her back to the wall when a large rock hit the living room wall of the cabin. April 23rd: Weather was cloudy and a bit cooler. The husband put apples out in different areas and did some wood knocks and tried some calls. They said no activity at all that day or night. Other than seeing some wild turkey. April 24th:Weather was rainy and cloudy. No activity at all. April 25th: The deck was scuffed up near the hot tub which sits next to a game trail. Part of the deck is wood and part is Trex.She said it looks similar to deer hooves marks but deep. The ground was dry. There was a fresh gouge out of the back deck. There were claw marks everywhere. Some were thin and long and she described them as 4 per print. The husband had heard some scuffling or something on the deck that night but never looked to see what it might be.  ",
