Several houses exist in the woods around me, but the properties are large and wooded, and civilization only diminishes as you head South. Our neighbors live about 20 yards East of us, and ten yards beyond their house are old growth cedars, maples, and firs. They weren't home at the time. I was in the middle of using my cordless drill, when I heard this call come from the woods. I instantly stopped drilling and listened. The first thing I thought was \"That's loud!\". It started in a low moan-like sound and climbed to almost a scream. The sound lasted steadily for three seconds, then was followed by two to three short whooping sounds. At that point I was severely freaked and was already heading inside. I only report it because it seems consistent with other reports I've read. Two days later, I down-loaded a Bigfoot scream, and the hair stood up on the back of my neck when I played it. That is what I heard.",
