            "Observed": "8 years ago my friend and I were bored one fall day and decided to hike through the forrest behind my house.  The forrest was very deep but also very easy to see through because there was very little brush.  Its the type of forrest with no trails, just tree after tree for miles.  It was late in the day, early evening.  The sun was going down and sending beams of late through the tree tops.  It must of rained the day before because it was very wet.  We wore our boots to keep our feet dry. With the musty smell of wet leaves and mud we walked deeper and deeper into the forrest.  All of a sudden we saw some type of wooden scraps laying on the ground.  With us pondering we saw what seemed to be cat eyes staring right back at us.  We believed it was a cat or raccoon or something.  While staring we heard a crackling noise of sticks being snapped.  When we looked behind us to see what it was we were shocked.  A furry creature between 7 to 8 feet tall was standing upright like a man staring right at us.  We freaked and began to run back towards my house.  As we were running I kept glancing back and the figure was keeping up with us.  As we got to the end of the woods my friend stepped on an apple thorn which went through his boot and into his foot.  He fell to his knees but with our addenaline pumping and fear of the creature we continued back to my house.  This took place 8 years ago but I still remember it like it was yesterday.  I stopped telling the story to people cause no one believes it.  Only me and my friend know it to be true from witnessing the creature with our own eyes.  We still talk about it from time to time but after meeting a believer a few days back I was influenced to share my story.",

He did not see any facial features or ears but did describe the creature standing on two legs, brown in color, and 7-8 feet tall. The creature appeared to have hair not fur. They came as close as 10 yards away.I spoke with his Mother who removed the thorn from the other boys foot once they reached the submitter's house. She was amazed that he was able to run enduring such pain. The thorn went through his boot and into his foot. She said the boys were extremely frightened. They live in the same house and although they still have woods around them, there has been development. No other incidents have occurred.",

            "Observed": "My husband and I were on a motorcycle ride to Siloam Springs State Park. We were driving about 40 to 45 miles per hour on a blacktop coming down a hill when I thought I saw a burnt tree trunk ahead on my right.  As we got closer I noticed hair so I looked it up and down and what I was looking at really shocked me.  I could see his side view very clearly.  It had a human body larger than a man's and very muscular. It had dark reddish brown hair about 2 to 3 inches long all over except for the head and face which was grey and white and I could even see light flesh under it.  It was standing straight with arms down by its side I could even see its fingers. It was looking down at the ground and standing very still. The back of his head looked rounded, but from his side he had a pronounced brow area that slanted upward to the crown of his head. His head looked like it set directly on his shoulders, I didn't notice a neck.  His face didn't have much hair and his lips looked thin and wide. When we drove back by the spot where I saw it, about 20 minutes later, there was nothing there.",
