            "Observed": "Deer hunting, south 101 out of Aberdeen, mile post 69, turn left on m-line -- logging road, turn left onto m-2800 stay left, #4 were I found a 20ft tree upside down stuck into the ground, about three feet in-- root side up... took a picture and drove to end.  I parked and set up for some good hunting. Time 0845am. Sun out things a warming up. facing north with a lot of open clear cut area, glassing it all. The hill in front across the valley is 150 yards across, heavily treed. At 10:45 half way up the center of this hill, comes a loud crashing running straight down the hill in front of me. He makes a (my left- his right) turn and jumps on this deer killing it. The deer cries out three times and stops. All is now quiet again. I try making my way down my hill up the hill in front of me, nothing doing.. started to rain again, could not cross the river or creek, so I moved back to my spot to hunt.. nothing happening, so I went home at 1:30 pm.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On January 10, 2011 this witness and I talked on the phone.  At this time he was out of the state. He recalled the incident from memory.  From his deer stand (folding chair next to a small fir tree), he heard a large creature run down the slope in front of him, then turn right (creatures right) and cut across slope.  It was running at high speed, and making a lot of noise doing so. Branches were breaking with loud pops and bangs.  He heard a deer cry out three times then went silent.  He said he heard a loud \u0093Pop\" prior to the silence.  He did not actually see the creature, but was recounting the incident based on what he heard.  From what he heard, he said that the creature would have been very large to make that much noise.On January 29, 2011 four other investigators and I met with the witness at the Aberdeen McDonalds.  We talked for a while and he recounted his experience and then we followed him out to the site.  He showed us where he was sitting, and where the creature came out of the woods on the slope across the creek from him, and then where the creature ran as it chased the deer. We took photos and some video.  One of the other investigators and I hiked down to the creek bottom which is timbered.  There are a lot of game trails going down through there, and the clear cut has been cleaned up so that there is not a lot of brush.  It was easy walking. The area had a lot of rain lately, and all older tracks were washed out. The soil in the creek bottom was very soft, and the creek was narrow and it was deep. A person or animal would have to jump across. It would have been a 300 yard bush-whack hike up the opposite slope to get to where the creature would have been.  We went no further than the creek. The roads on the other side are gated, but a hike in to that side is possible.  Items to note:1. There is a tree trunk, approximately 20 feet long turned upside-down and jammed into the ground about 100 yards east of where the witness was sitting.2. We found a possible impression, length about 14 inches, along the road at the top of the cut-bank.  Rain washed out features, but the size and shape are correct for a sasquatch.  Inconclusive, however.3. The distance from the witness to the far side where the creature was heard is from 1/3 to 1/4 mile away (note the yellow line I drew). It looks further in the photos, but was measured using Google Earth software.  This picture shows the witness (Tan coat) where he was positioned at the time. Across the valley is indicated where the creature was. 4. The creature chased the deer for approximately 450 yards before catching it and killing it.It is impossible to say for sure what chased down and killed the deer. The witness did not actually see it.  The description of the amount of noise and branch breaking that the unseen creature made makes it unlikely to be a bear.  A cougar could do the same as the witness observed, but would probably not make as much noise.  What the witness heard was made by a very large, and very fast animal. This area has had persistent reports over the years.  Hunters have reported seeing sasquatches, hearing wood knocking and vocalizations.",
