He had just passed a place called Robinson Mill and came around a corner when right in front of him at about 100ft, something was crossing the road.  It was walking on two legs and was covered in a medium brown hair from head to toe.  One thing noticed was it's height; about 5 ft tall.  It's build was long and thin for it's height.  The hair hanging from its arms seemed to be long.  It was very fast as it ran.",

The author has been a local logger in the area since 1984 and a friend of the witness since 1983. The witness is in his late 40's. This sighting took place in the early afternoon, mid-July 2003. The witness was driving to town in his pickup truck and coasting downhill when he came upon the creature crossing the road. The witness noted that the creature never looked directly at him, but broke into a run and leapt into the brush located approximately forty feet from the road. The witness noted how extremely \"skinny\" the creature appeared to be, that it was approximately 5 ft tall and that it had very thin arms with long hair hanging off of them.  ",
