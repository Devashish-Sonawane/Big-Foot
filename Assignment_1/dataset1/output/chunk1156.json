            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness and her family had been exposed to the ongoing activity for nearly the entire 4 years they lived at the home. The home they lived in was owned by the chicken plant her husband worked for, and was part of the salary package. Free rent and a salary. They had 8 children in total, and about half of them recall many or all of the incidents. Map of the area:I will address the incidents in the order she outlined.The owl: As mentioned, it was \"off sounding\" and much louder than the others they heard. It almost always came from the same general area, which was a hollow near the home. At times, the owl would \"sound like a normal owl, then evolve into almost a chatter or \"jibberish\". But it was almost always \"way too loud\" for a normal owl. The kids afraid of their room: About 6 months or so, after moving in, is when the kids were \"creeped\" out about sleeping in their room at night. They felt like \"someone was watching them\" after dark. They almost always had cartoons or other kid type entertainment on at night, and the witness had surmised, after doing some research, that the \"creature\" was attracted to the kids and their banter, and the TV on. When the banging on the wall started, they were out of there for good. After they abandoned the bedroom, they still used it as a playroom during the day, and up until bedtime. It was after they abandoned that room when the banging started picking up and becoming more frequent. And only at night. The family kept their guns in a small room next to the kids playroom, and when the banging got really loud, hubby would head for the room, grab a gun, and the banging almost always stopped at that point.Mama goat: The mama and her twins were very attached to the family and the house. Never strayed far at all. When they found the mama and one baby, the hides were removed, not torn into or ravaged as a normal predator would do. It was \"skinned or peeled back\". As stated, there were no drag marks or any blood trail, and they were pretty sure they were carried there.The screaming incident: I will only add what was discovered during our conversation. Her account is pretty vivid and did not waiver much at all. The description of the yells were that it started as a low rumble type sound, which is why she thought it may have been a bull a few pastures over. But the sound \"pounded her in the chest, and then the low rumbles turned into a higher pitched yell, but not a scream\". In other words, the sound started out low then ended up higher before it stopped. It was described by her as a \"lions roar\" (the lower sound). I will address the \"sadness or melancholy\" feelings she had during this event later, as there are other similar \"feelings or sensations\".Tapping on the water pipes: After hearing the tapping a few times, her husband crawled under the home to inspect the pipes and everything was in order. He then went out to the pump house to find the latch had been unlatched and the door was opened, but nothing was amiss. He tapped on the pipes to gauge where the pipes were being tapped on, and they figured out it was from the pump house, not from under the home.Chicken coop incident: This event was not in the original report, and this is where we delve into the theory of infra sound and melancholy. She had gone out to check on the coop, as was normal before dark. On her way back, she was \"knocked down by an unseen force or person\". She fell forward and immediately rolled over to see nothing, or no one, there. She \"felt\" the push, but it was more an overall sensation of being \"pushed\" without the sensation of \"hands on her\". Almost \"like a very strong gust of wind\". We discussed infra sound, and other types of possible paranormal influences. Let me say that this is a religious Christian family, with the \"normal beliefs and practices\" associated with their religion. Before they determined it was Sasquatch related, they had the family priest come out and bless the home and property to be certain there were no evil entities, and the priest said he had no inkling of anything of that nature. Also of note, the witness began having migraine headaches shortly after moving in, and they ceased once they moved out. Home was tested for lead, carbon monoxide, and other possible contaminants. None were found. There was a somewhat constant \"suppressive atmosphere\" the entire time they lived there. They had an unspoken \"knowledge and agreement\" that they would just not go near, or look out windows after dark. Just a robotic existence. If you read her \"Also noticed\", she describes it perfectly. Many of the feelings and sensations they experienced are some of the side effects of infra sound. Confusion, lethargy, sadness or melancholy, discomfort, etc. The mention of \"two different vocals coming out at the same time\" is not an unfamiliar description. When examining audio recordings of Sasquatch, there are many instances where there are \"background sounds or calls\" during one vocal recording.Regarding \"things being moved around and missing\" I will post this quote from her. \"Just odd things, the shovel we used in the donkey pen, kids push toys we kept by the house would be down the hill by the creek, we had a wheel barrow and a wagon for hauling feed and they would be in a different place. The top part of the door to the barn was open most mornings even though we closed it every night.\" The other peripheral instances of another family being driven form their home, missing or dead pets and animals, etc, are very consistent with reported Sasquatch activity.This is an excellent witness, and her account is thorough, descriptive and reveals with great clarity the emotional effect this 4 year adventure had on the entire family.

            "Observed": "On our way home to Rockmart, GA from Birmingham, AL, we were following the directions the GPS gave for the distance.  This brought us to Hwy 120 and Vincent Mountain Road.  We had just made that turn and gone a mile and a half when my husband and myself saw a large figure standing in the tree line.  There was illumination coming from the right side of the road from an additional light source other than our car headlights.  This enabled us to clearly see this figure that was on the left side of the road with one arm straight down and the other arm slightly moving.  I believe that arm movement is what caught our attention making us both look to our left CLEARLY allowing us both to view this creature.  It was covered in reddish brown fur from head to toe with a face I can only describe as Ape like. It appeared to be over seven feet tall. He/she seemed to be getting ready to cross the road. After about 15 seconds past, he and I both screamed out, \"did you just see what I saw???\"",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with both witnesses and they both seemed level headed and still excited about what they had seen that night. It was approx. 10:30 pm when both witnesses and their 20 year old daughter (sleeping in the back seat) were headed home to Rockmart, GA from Birmingham, AL. on the night of Dec. 3rd 2016.It was raining a light drizzle, which was a welcome change as Georgia is in the midst of a statewide drought... it was the first sign of any precipitation in 2 months.. After turning onto Vincent Mountain Road and traveling approx. 1 1/2 miles, the wife noticed a slight movement on the left side of road. It was approx. 50 feet ahead and the car was traveling at 45mph.  It was slightly illuminated from the parking lots lights from a church directly across the street. The witnesses stated if it wasn't for the slight movement it made, they may not have seen it. It was described as standing between 2 trees, approx 15 feet from the car, 7-8 feet tall, covered in red/orangeish brown hair with a face of a mix between a man and a gorilla. The witnesses stated they believe the movement that drew their attention was that of its left arm...they watched it for a total of about 6 seconds. The wife stated it acted like it was about to step out and cross the road. The creature watched the couple go by as they observed it. As they passed it, the wife was able to look back thru the rear glass at it, as it was still in the church lights. It wasn't until they had drove down the road about another mile that the husband asked if she'd \"seen anything back there\". They both agreed immediately they had just seen a Bigfoot..these witnesses stated that they cant imagine it was anything else as it was too tall to be a person in costume...",
