He had seen a bigfoot as a child in New Mexico and felt a sense of relief that he had a witness with him for this second sighting.  This second sighting happened while he was scouting for deer with his wife. The animal was reddish brown, looked at them for about 10 seconds from 20 yards away. They turned to talk to each other, looked once again and it was gone. Estimated height was 7-8 ft tall.  The next morning they found tracks around their tent, they did not measure them.  ",
