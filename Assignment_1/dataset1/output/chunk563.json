            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was very believable and down to earth. He was a complete non-believer until this happened. The witness also stated that as the creature stepped out of the trees toward the highway it put its arm up in front of its face, then turned around and headed back into the trees. The motorist was roughly 50 yards away when he first noticed the subject and passed within an estimated 30 feet of it as it returned to the woods. He did not get a good look at its face, but was able to add that its arms were longer than ours and its hair was shaggy, but straight. It walked with a slight hunch. There were other motorists who may have witnessed this incident. It is interesting to note that the Interstate has a 4-5 foot high wire fence running along-side the highway, that is partially concealed by the foliage. Had this been a hoaxter in a costume, this location would be a poor choice. If confronted, he would have to attempt to scale the fence, in costume, to escape into the woods. Not to mention someone would have had to drop the hoaxter off on the side of a very busy interstate.This exit leads to the Blackwater River State Forest. This area has a history of sightings. I, along with Georgia Investigator Ken Johnson, also had our own possible encounter while camping on the Blackwater River.The area is rich in wildlife with thick vegetation and many food and water sources. It consists of mainly pine forests, but there are many other species of trees also. There are some very remote areas in this tract.   ",
