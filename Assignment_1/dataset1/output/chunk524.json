            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the submitter of the report who was able to put me in contact with his parents about the encounter. In talking to both witnesses, I learned that the male witness saw the animal cross the road, and the female witness saw the animal after it had already crossed the road. The witnesses described the animal as a \u0093rust\u0094 color or the color of \u0093dead pine needles.\u0094 They further described it as being very quick, large and very hairy. The witnesses stated that the animal appeared to be stooped over while running and that it seemed to occasionally use a hand to push off the ground. When I asked the witnesses about the height of the animal, they both said that it was difficult to say because of the stooped nature of the animal\u0092s run, but it appeared to be maybe six feet tall.  The witnesses stated that the animal never stopped running while it was in their field of view. The witnesses told of a possible encounter that occurred in the same area about two weeks prior to this sighting at approximately the same time of the morning. The witnesses told of seeing an enormous puddle of blood in the highway (787) and a large blood trail leading to the guard rail at the bridge. Just on the other side of the guard rail was a large, hairy animal lying in a heap, somewhat sitting up. The witnesses passed at such a rate of speed that no details could be discerned, except that the color was reddish-brown or \u0093rust,\u0094 just as in the sighting mentioned above. By the time the witnesses could turn their vehicle around and pass by the area again, the animal was gone. The male witness wanted to stop the vehicle, but the female witness urged him not to do so.Neither witness could say with certainty what it was they saw on other side of the guard rail, but they said they knew that it was large and hairy and reddish-brown in color.The male witness told me that he has known for years of the existence of these animals, and he is troubled that hardly anyone takes the matter seriously. He also stated that he hopes no one will try to kill one of the animals, because he doesn't think they are harmful.  ",

The witness related to me the account of what he and his wife saw. They were driving west on the Upper Hoh Road, returning back to highway 101. They were about 400 yards, \u00bc mile, from the creature when they saw it walk across the road in front of them from right to left, which would be going towards the river. Both of them witnessed the creature cross the road in 3 steps. It was too far away to see any details, other than it was a very large bi-pedal creature. Using maps and Google Earth, we were able to determine approximately where the sighting occurred. From the description of what they saw, there could be no mistaking that they witnessed a sasquatch cross the road in front of them. This area has long been known for sightings. ",
