            "Observed": "First, I\u0092ll start with the fact that I have never put much stock into the Bigfoot phenomenon.  I have degrees in wildlife management and wildlife biology and I have been working as a biologist for the last 17 years.  I have never believed that something could exist that has never left any concrete evidence.  Furthermore, nothing similar has ever been found in the fossil record that I know of so that has lead me to believe it was all false, until this weekend (Nov 24, 2013).",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a biologist at a local area animal park. He has taught college level courses on bear and knows that what he witnessed that morning was not bear nor man. The gentleman\u0092s professional standing and occupation lead this report to be credible and sound.The biologist went to Cypress Creek Nature Preserve in the morning to photograph birds. Google Earth image of the area:He saw much wildlife while hiking to a spot to set up his camera.  About 1 mile into the trail at 9:04 AM, he set up his tripod. While doing so, he heard a noise and turned to his left and looked. About 50 - 60 yards from him was a sasquatch crossing the trail. Unfortunately, the camera was pointed in the opposite direction and he was unable to take a photo. But he was able to take this photo where it had been after it walked across, the sasquatch was taller than the palmetto palm on the right:He described the sasquatch at more than 6 ft tall, black in color, and having a very wide torso. It was muscular in its profile. It walked briskly across the trail left to right, never looking in his direction. Its gait had a forward lean to it and he describes the walk as very smooth. The facial features blended into the dark face and he was not able to see them. There were no apparent breasts or tail. The head was round, but larger than a human.He walked up to where it had been on the trail and could only hear it walking away. He noticed that the woods became quiet after the sighting.The area of this sighting is very close to my home as the preserve borders my property. It is a state recognized wildlife corridor that connects the Hillsborough River and the Green Swamp in Pasco and Polk Counties. (We receive numerous reports from both of these areas.) I was able to get to the location two days after the event. When I got to the location of the trail crossing, I noticed several tree breaks in both directions, indicating something large had walked through.  Interestingly, while I was photographing the broken branches, a tree about 25 yards away from me crashed to the ground. I ventured in that direction, singing softly but was unable to detect any other movement.Field investigation video: Ten days later, BFRO Investigators Marian Gant, Joanna Cuva and myself spent a night near the location. After several day hikes that consisted of seeing lots of wildlife, we found the night eerily quiet without any noise. I will continue to monitor the area. ",
