            "Follow-Up Report": "This remarkable encounter lasted approximately 1 minute to 1 1/2 minutes before the sasquatch departed, allowing the eye witness ample time to examine it from the security of the elevated truck cab. The location is at the end of a notoriously steep, long uphill haul from Pendleton into the Blue Mountains and trucks move at a crawl. The driver had to stop rather sharply, but it was not an emergency stop.He estimates the height of the sasquatch to have been about 8' with a shoulder width of about 4'. The overall appearance of the sasquatch was the equivalent, by the witness' description, of a beautifully shaped, athletic human male with a slender waist. He mentioned futher that it had a dense matted beard, heavy sideburns and coarse, matted bangs, overall a rather hairy face, all of it looking like unkempt human hair. It had pronounced brow ridges, larger than human eyes that were light colored but not reflective in the headlights of the truck, a human type nose, though broad (\"bulbous\"), with down-facing nostrils, the mouth slightly open, showing large teeth and conspicuous canines though not long enough to be called \"fangs\". The sasquatch was breathing hard at first sight, as judged by the steam coming from its mouth. It hit the hood of the truck with both hands. As it departed, it intially walked away but then accelerated to a speedy jog before it disappeared to the side of the highway.",
