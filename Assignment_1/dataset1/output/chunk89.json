            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and I spoke by phone and he provided copies of the pictures that his son had taken of the footprints in the snow.  Although interesting, the prints were not conclusive enough to be verified.  The photos showed a large print in the snow but did not provide adequate detail.  Here is one of the pics:The snow was merely a dusting.  They had been discovered in the morning and by noon they were no longer visible.  The son said that there were several of them in a row but he only took photos of the one.  I was however, intrigued by the location.  The witness and his son agreed to meet with me at the location and take a \"walk\" following the direction of the original foot prints.The location is in a subdivision west of Windsor and immediately south of the Poudre River corridor.  In fact, the footprints were approximately a block from the river and headed north in that direction.The houses in this particular subdivision are separated by small open spaces that are secluded by trees and bushes and have waterways that aid in run off.  We were able to reach the river hidden by the vegetation and walking in the depressions.  In the dark it would provide adequate cover to navigate without attracting attention.There is abundant game and water in the area and to the south are agricultural fields to supplement the food supply.The town of Greeley lies to the east and there have been alleged sightings in between the two communities over the years.  There has been verified sightings of moose, deer and mountain lions along this same section of the river. Therefore, it is not inconceivable that the river corridors are being used for travel by many animals.",
