            "Observed": "I have been hunting Green Swamp since the late 70\u0092s. Though I tend to hunt more than one Wildlife Management Area each year the Green Swamp WMA is a go-to area for me. I have spent possibly a thousand days in the Green Swamp over the last 35 years. I am very familiar with terrain and all of the plants, insects, and wildlife in the area. I have a demanding job that makes it difficult to coordinate a hunt with friends, so for the last 30 or so years I have hunted alone. I have walked in and out of different hunt locations in the dark hundreds of times and have never seen or heard anything that alarmed me.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken to the witness several times and each time he is as detailed in the event as he was in filing his report. He spoke in the BFRO\u0092s Florida Town Hall Event in 2017.He stated the event always perplexed him because he just couldn\u0092t figure out why 3 men in black ghillie suits would be walking in a hunting area, during hunting season without vests, weapons, backpacks or gear. The three large figures walked with purpose or regard of possibly being in danger. When he watched a bigfoot show on TV he began to think that perhaps it was bigfoots that he encountered that day walking in the woods. He had never consider this, but that made more sense to him that any other explanation he could think of. Military activity has been ruled out as safety is always important and this would not occur in an active hunting area. Drug activity is always a possibility but unlikely without weapons. The odd colored black ghillie suits without vests would not work in either case especially during daylight hours. The witness knows this occured midweek in early January of 2012. The exact day in unknown. I have assigned January 4, 2012 for sorting purposes. The green swamp has many public reports of bigfoot activity including Report #41309 and Report #25129.In 2009 FL BFRO were investigating reports of three black Bigfoots in the Green Swamp. Tracks of three individuals were found and cast. That investigation was not made public due to privacy reasons. ",
