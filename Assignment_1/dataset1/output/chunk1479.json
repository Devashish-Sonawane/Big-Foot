            "Observed": "This hunting season we went to the same place we go every year up Falls Creek Road out side of Winthrop.  This is the same place we had rock smashing and wood knocking the year before as I explained in Report # 13487.  This year we walked down towards falls creek to check out the area we heard rocks being smashed together the year before out of curiosity.  The natural trail that was formed by cattle and deer follows all along the bottom and we use it to walk the bottoms near the creek.  3 of us walked down and as we walked the trail every 10-30 yards were fresh trees broken over at about 5 to 8 feet.  These trees were anywhere from 6 - 15 inches in diameter.  Something would have to have a lot of strength to pull down and snap and have to be quite tall to grab as well.  They were all fresh.  These were not wind falls or caused by snow.  I can tell the difference.  Normally there are a number a trees that are snapped by snow or fallen over by wind.  These were random along a trail and where there was a break another tree next to it was fine and probably more susceptible to wind or snow.  When we got to the creek at about where we thought we heard the rock smashing from the year before you could see the trail continue on at the other side of the creek as if this was where all the animals crossed the creek at.  2 trees at about 5 feet apart on either side of the trail were both twisted over at their tops.  We also had what looks like foot prints coming out of the creek.  They were coming out of the creek on a small incline up to the top of the bank.  They were about 13-14 inches long and the stride was 4 to 5 feet apart.  I am 6' and it was hard for me to maintain that stride.  There were 4 prints in total.  Some better than others depending on the terrain.  It was right next to the creek so it was very hard and rocky.  However, all of the prints were deeper than my boot could make.  Something definitely heavy made the prints.  What was obvious was on all of the tracks the toes were very visible and were very wide at the front and the big toe was to the inside.  Being on an incline more of the weight was on the front and less on the back however a heal could be easily scene.  It definitely was not a bear doubling up the tracks.  We see bear prints all of the time around this area and these were nothing like this. It was raining when we discovered the tracks so it was hard to tell how old they might be.  My Dad, my friend, and I are convinced there is something unusual hanging around where we camp given last year and this year.",
