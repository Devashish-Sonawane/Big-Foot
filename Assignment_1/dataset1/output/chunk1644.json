            "Follow-Up Report": "After visiting the witness at her home, the following details can be added to this report:At the time of the incident, the witness and her two daughters were in the house. The daughters were upstairs asleep and didn\u0092t hear the event. She described the breathing sound as a \u0093gorilla-like\u0094 grunting noise that began just before something hit the outside wall of her bedroom directly above the headboard of the bed and hard enough that she could feel the vibration. It hit the wall two more times as it proceeded down the side of the house and around the corner, then triggered a motion-sensing floodlight that is placed approximately 18ft up on the wall. This particular light is a replacement for one that was mounted at an eleven foot height, but which had recently been ripped off of the house. The bedroom has white vinyl mini blinds on the window, which were closed, and the creature was silhouetted by the light above as it attempted to peer inside. The outline of the figure clearly showed a very large head on top of a huge body that completely covered the rest of the 36\" wide window. She observed the shadow swaying back and forth, as if trying to find a gap in the blinds to see through. Also, she was able to hear the creature breathing as it was at the window. This is when she turned the volume up on the television in an unsuccessful attempt to scare the visitor away. After five to six minutes, the shadow moved away from the window. Based on her placement of the figure, the top of the head was over 8 ft off the ground. It should be noted that the house is somewhat elevated with the bottom of the 48\" tall bedroom window being slightly over 6 ft above ground level.The witness phoned her brother once the visitor had moved away from the window. He lives nearby but was not too eager to get out of bed in the middle of the night so he agreed to come over if she experienced any additional activity, which she did not.The next morning as the witness and her youngest daughter were leaving the house, they both observed two footprints (one left, one right, five toes each) in the snow along the front walkway. The young girl was visibly shaken at this sight. The mother, in her haste to get the child off to school and away from the scene, didn\u0092t take time to photograph or measure the prints. However, she did place her forearm and outstretched fingers above one of the prints to get an idea of the length. Based on this measurement, the length can be estimated at between 14 - 16\". The width, as demonstrated to me, was around 7 - 8\" with the big toe being two inches in diameter, and the stride length at 7 feet. After arriving at work, she phoned her oldest daughter, who was still sleeping, and asked her to photograph the prints. Unfortunately, by this time the snow had already melted and the prints were no longer visible.This family has been living at their present location for over 10 years, during which time they have had multiple incidents, including the unexplained killing of several of their dogs. The witness\u0092 house is located on a ridge with canyons to the north and south, from which loud, wailing vocalizations are frequently heard. The residents of this housing area, and those immediately surrounding it, have had many bigfoot sightings as well as numerous other events that are consistent with reported bigfoot behavior. This report is from the Mescalero Apache Reservation, located in the Sacramento Mountains of south central New Mexico. Encompassing 720 square miles, with elevations ranging from 5,400 to 12,000 ft, the area is rich in wildlife and supportive resources. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness, whom I will call Mark, by phone.  I enjoyed hearing his account and visiting with him.  It is quite apparent that this encounter changed him as he will not go back in those woods again at night.  And these are woods he spent much of his early life hunting and camping in.He and his friend had set up camp.  They drove into a very remote place by means of a fire road.  After setting up camp they spent some time shooting and just having a good time.  They were back at camp between 9 and 10pm.  They were enjoying the evening and the campfire and just talking.  About 11 to 11:30 they began to hear howling.  The howling was the Ohio Howl.  He said he knew whatever was howling was big as it was extremely loud and carried and was drawn out.  He described it as \u0093really coming out of the chest\u0094 of whatever was making it.  They also started to hear the sounds of branches being broken.  It is important to note a couple of things.  At this point they were in camp. The camp was near the fire road at a lower elevation.  The sounds were coming from up on top of the ridge to their west and where they were the fire road runs north and south.  It was also pitch black so the only light was the campfire. They were in a tactically vulnerable position.  No other normal outdoor sounds were present which he found strange.They talked with each other and basically agreed that they had no idea what could be making those sounds.  After a bit, they decided to at least move around and sort of investigate.  They went up the fire road maybe 100 to 150 yards.  They never did leave the fire road and venture into the trees.  This is when the squatch started getting more aggressive.  The howls continued and interestingly enough they were always the Ohio Howl.  The creature also began moving toward them down the hill very loudly.  It was making no effort to conceal itself.  On the contrary, it was making every effort to make its presence known.  I asked if he ever felt there was more than one.  After a pause he said, \u0093No, it was the same creature\u0094.When they figured out that it was coming closer, they decided to head back to camp where at least they had a fire as some level of protection.  He described the creature\u0092s movements down the hill as if it was taking a switchback path.  Zig zagging as it came down.  When they got back to camp, they could still hear the creature and the howls continued, but they were more spread out.  Eventually maybe around 1am they went to bed and while they could still hear some movement initially, even that died down.At first light they were up, packing and getting out of there.  I asked if they went into the trees to look for any sign.  He sort of half laughed and said, \u0093No, No, No, No way!\u0094   He has been back to the spot since, but only in day light.  It is my opinion that for whatever reason the squatch did not want them there and was even more unhappy when they left camp.  After successfully getting them back to camp, it toned down its intimidation until they finally got in the tent.  I discussed that idea with Mark and after a bit of thought he said that made a lot of sense.  It is important to note that Mark knows wildlife, is a hunter and is very familiar with this area and what lives there.  And as he noted his friend was an active duty Marine and he was really frightened.             ",
