Standing to the right of the house, facing the back, is a large open grassy field surrounded by woods. I was looking to the back staring at this particular tree that stood out to me, when suddenly something very tall, very large, stepped away from the tree looking at me. My arm with the phone dropped and my jaw dropped and I was thinking to myself, \"What the **** is that!\".",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness was standing on the base of a basketball hoop stand, the type that is filled with sand, looking toward the woods which were behind the house, about a football field away. A tall hairy creature stepped away from behind a tree off to his right, looked at him and quickly took off \u0093like a deer\u0094 across the field. It took long strides and was leaning forward. The hair of the creature was light brown and reddish, as if sun-faded.Witness speculates that the creature had been in the area for a while. The day after the observation he could not get into the house to do contracting work because alarms were triggered at a back door and a back window. The owner\u0092s daughter said that the alarms were triggered during the night. The dad said that no one ever used the door under the deck where one alarm was triggered. The window where the second alarm was triggered was on the other side of a small pond by the deck. Witness wonders if the creature was curious and looked into the house, which had dogs in it at the time.In the phone interview I found the witness' report to be compelling and the witness credible.The area where this sighting occurred is at the edge of an upland, very near the Mississippi River. The timber that the creature escaped into could easily be followed a few miles east to the river. The timber is on the edge of a large valley that intersects the Mississippi River valley, and the general topography is very dramatic with pronounced relief, especially this close to the river.",
