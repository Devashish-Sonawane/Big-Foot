The site is located about two miles north of Silverton and due south of Mt. Angel. Especially the upper reaches of the Abiqua have been the source of many sasquatch reports. The characteristically stacked rocks and the nesting site in combination with previous encounters by the grandfather as well as the locale serve to provide a higher level of probability for these observations than they might have in isolation.",
