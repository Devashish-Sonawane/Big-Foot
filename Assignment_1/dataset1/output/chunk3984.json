            "Observed": "When I was a child, I heard my grandfather, a man who quit school at sixteen, tell stories about something that lived in the Burns Rebrake (a swampy area owned by a Mr. Homer Burns). The stories he told went back as far as WWI and included among others, my grandfather and my father. They never got a good look at the thing(my father always attributed it to bootleggers)but my grandfather said whatever it was, it drove lumbermen out of the woods and beat panther hounds so bad that they didn't come home for days. When I was little, I listened to the old people describe the thing and it didn't register in my mind until I got older that it sounded an awful lot like a sasquatch. I've heard there's something in Lousiana, and with all the primitive waterways that cross that two states, I wouldn't be surprised if the two aren't connected. The Burns Booger as they called it has been absent from the area since the sixties when the lumber companies went high tech. This is the same time the last panther was heard in Attala County.",
