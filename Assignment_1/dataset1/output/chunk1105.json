            "Other Stories": "A sasquatch was seen above a nearby lumber mill about 4 years earlier. Nick had been sleeping on the screened porch of the house and had heard noises (rustling brush) and \"slapping\" foot steps on the street during the night. Similar sounds were heard by the overnighting Sasquatch investigators after the sighting. Earlier in the same year, while a Little League baseball game was in progress at the Yacolts ball park, a sasquatch stepped out of the forest in full view of the spectators in the bleachers and briefly viewed the game in progress before retreating into the forest. A neighbor and his daughter saw the Sasquatch on an evening after the G.'s sighting, but refused to talk about it to investigators. A couple of investigators from Seattle arrived and proceeded to establish a camp in the early evening on the steep hillside, where the thimbleberry patch had been found. After several hours, about 11 PM, they came racing down the hillside, dragging their unfolded tent and sleeping bags behind in disarray, got into their VW van and left without further comment, never to be heard from again.",

            "Observed": "Mrs. Brenda G., washing the dinner dishes, looking out over her backyard, past the horse corral with its pony and off into the distance, notices that suddenly the horse becomes unruly and seems close to panic, while an indistinct figure passes through the trees behind the corral. She calls to Nick: \"Nick, there are some kids out there trying to tease the horse\" and steps out the kitchen back door with a BB-gun in her hands for good measure. Nick races out past her and some distance down the overgrown meadow along the stand of trees, where he comes abruptly face to face with a sasquatch standing on the indistinct foot path. Nick comes to such a \"screeching halt\" that he slides on moist vegetation and sits down on the ground. For reassurance he throws a backward look to his mother who, however, has returned to the house. When he looks back at the sasquatch, it is already walking with long strides across the brush and wildflower covered meadow, \"lifting up his feet more than people do\". As Nick scrambles to get up, a branch snaps and the sasquatch turns to look at him \"with big eyes\".",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The circumstances suggest that a young sasquatch was wandering through the countryside in the company of an older sibling (young male), providing the impetus for the unusual confrontational, protective display. The narrow waist suggests a young male. Yellow color of nails is probably a function of thick keratin. Dirtiness seems to be the rule for Spring sightings. Thimbleberry vines were evidently cleaned by sliding the hand along the cane from the ground up. Despite the apparent lack of smell, dogs, horse and cows reacted without very close encounters. An effort to attract the sasquatch by baiting (hibachi glowing for hours in the meadow with hot dogs on it, strategically scattered doughnuts etc.) and viewing the surround during an ensuing night with night vision binoculars proved fruitless. The final comment by John about playing with the \"little monkey\" has to be weighed against the exclusive and pervasive sasquatch talk after the event by the adults, family and visitors alike and, conversely, the guilelessness of small children and his identification of the subadult sasquatch as a \"big monkey\".
