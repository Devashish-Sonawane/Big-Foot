            "Observed": "Leaving from Wilson Mills, NC ... I went to visit with my fiance and her family in Taylorsville / Hickory North Carolina on Oct 15 2012. On October 18th 2013 around 5:45 pm, I left to meet her and her nephews to take them to a Haunted Trail (For Halloween) after she got off of work. I left from their mobile home, and turned right onto Friendship Church Road in Taylorsville to get on 16. It is about 5 miles from their home on Friendship Church Road to Hwy 16. About 30 seconds after I pulled out of the driveway, onto the road, I looked into an open field on the left, they sell muscadine grapes (there is a dirt road that leads into the vineyard area) and about 30-40 yards off the road, and about 15 yards off of the dirt road/path there what at the time was a bear sitting on its butt, I saw it only for about 4 seconds while passing. I got down the road about 1/8 mile and turned around in a local church parking lot, when I got back, there was another vehicle turned into the dirt path, I slowed down and rolled my windows down, and the lady asked me \"Do you see that thing?\" which I didn't see it anymore, she then pointed, I looked, and it was walking on two legs into the tree line. We then spoke for a few more minutes, before I left. I told her I turned around to get another look. I knew then it was not a bear after I saw it walking on two legs like a human. I learned about the BFRO on Finding Bigfoot show on Animal Planet last night, and wanted to share my story.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. His recollection of the events that afternoon were excellent. He had left his girlfriends parents home and was on Friendship Church Road in Alexander County, North Carolina heading East Towards Highway 16. He looked to the left in a field where they grow and sell Muscadine grapes and saw what he thought was a bear sitting in the field. He was intrigued by what he saw and he drove 1/8th mile and turned around in a church parking lot to go back and view what he saw. Upon arrival he saw another person had pulled into a dirt road that was at the site and was watching the animal in the field.The other witness was driving a grey Toyota Camry, He pulled in and parked and asked the other witness if she saw the bear? She responded \"that's no bear\". She then pointed to it and he saw it again. It was walking on two legs and he briefly saw it as it went into the wood line. He was very convinced they witnessed a Sasquatch. The two conversed a few minutes and both were convinced they saw a Sasquatch, not a bear. It was very tall and walked very quickly. He did not see any facial features and only said it was very tall and broad. It was a very dark brown or black in color.The area is mixed farmlands and forests. it is in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. It has agriculture, chicken farms, and fruit orchards. Wildlife include whitetail deer, wild turkeys, and numerous small mammals and waterfowl. It is in the Catawba River basin which has had numerous Sasquatch reports. The animal was probably eating dried muscadine grapes in the field, and at first was unaware of the attention it was drawing.",
