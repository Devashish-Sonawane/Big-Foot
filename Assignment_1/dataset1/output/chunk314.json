            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness and had an in-depth conversation about his experiences over the phone.  I arranged a meeting at the property where he has had the encounters. He claims there are at least four individual bigfoot ranging in height from six to eight feet and one large individual that is at least ten feet in height and perhaps five feet in width.  He has only had one daytime sighting. This was in 2017 where he saw a bipedal figure, all black in color, standing approximately 50 meters into the wood line.  The witness never was able to get a good look, and the observation lasted for less than a minute. This observation was reenacted by myself and the witness during a visit to the witness's residence.  Through this we determined that the figure in question was approximately six feet tall, and that the clothing worn by ourselves could readily be identified at the same distance the figure was seen.During my visit, the witness and I walked through the forest behind his residence at length and he showed me various tree breaks and tree bends.  The height, type, and branch width of the breaks rule out any human or weather-related explanation.  Additionally, the style of breaks observed is congruent with other tree breaks and tree structures that I have identified here in southern Georgia.The witness also permitted me and another investigator to conduct an overnight investigation on his property in late March of 2020.  Nothing was visually observed, although we did hear two distinct sets of bipedal footsteps approach us from two separate directions and then withdraw.The witness lives in rural southern Georgia, an agricultural area of low population density characterized by farmland, conifer plantations, mixed deciduous forest, and swamp in roughly equal measure.  Additionally, the witness is only two miles from the Withlacoochee River, a 141-mile-long north to south tributary of the Suwannee River, which possesses a floodplain greenbelt that ranges in width from 1/8 to 1 mile wide that is essentially devoid of human habitation and visitation. The witness also informed me that his cousin who lives in the area also observed a bigfoot walking across a back pasture near a pond on his cousin's property.  The witness is reaching out to coordinate a meeting between myself and his cousin to document his observation in greater detail.The videos taken by the witness were from a security camera that he installed on his back deck to monitor his backyard in the hopes of catching a bigfoot on film.  I reviewed the footage he has, and while there is definitely some kind of movement occurring behind the wood line of his property, unfortunately, the resolution is such that no features can be distinguished.  However, the witness does have a video that shows a small animal, either a cat or an opossum, being grabbed by what strongly appears to be a hand and forearm that reaches out from behind a bush.  The arm and animal disappear for twenty minutes, then the animal is placed back out of the bush and then runs off, seemingly unharmed.  I cannot obviously declare that the video shows a bigfoot hand and forearm, but there is nothing else I am aware of that could do what I saw in the video as no other known animals have those same proportions or possess that level of appendage manipulation.  I also had the opportunity to go the exact site in person and physically measure the distance the hand and arm reached out.  The length of the presumed forearm and hand, as measured from the assumed elbow joint of the unknown animal was six feet.  The videos provided by the witness are saved on his personal computer and uploaded to a private YouTube channel.  The resolution unfortunately is low, and as such lacks in the detail required to definitively state that the movement seen in the footage is indeed a bigfoot.The witness\u0092s description of his multiple sightings and observations, combined with his video footage he captured and my own observations and experiences at that location lead me to conclude that he and his family have a resident population of bigfoot within the area.
