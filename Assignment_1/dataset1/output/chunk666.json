There have been a male & female spotted on my dirt lane (that was about 30 years ago, when an Uncle saw them). I still believe there are more than one, because I hear the whistle signals. People I've told , commented \"oh, they whistle too (said sarcastically-doubting Thomases)\". I did not know that the whistles were signals until I watched your show tonight. Makes me feel alot better knowing that somebody besides me knows that they whistle. When my garden (200x100 feet) was still growing, lots of vegetables were missing. Now, if I leave vegetable and fruit scraps out, up high, it will eat them.",

When I take out the garbage at night, I hear him walking parallel to me, about 20 feet (he in the wooded area), but I am not afraid of him, nor do I believe that he is afraid of me. He doesn't bother the other wild animals that come up to feed on the back porch, so I am certain they are not afraid of him either. There is alot of thicket, and yet he can run through it at superhuman speed. I have thought about putting night vision cameras outside.",

The last two sightings, within the past year(eyes on), were by one of my grown sons \"that thought the old timers here were telling \"Booger-y stories\", until he saw him. My neighbor and I went in search of \"someone messing around in the wooded area\". Long story short he ran towards the heavy footsteps (heard clearly on the leaves and brush), thinking he was going to see a man. I stayed directly across from him (about 30 yards), as he ran at what he was sure would be a man.  He found out differently as it ran with lightening speed. As it passed me, it looked like an 8 or nine foot tall flash as it ran past me in the moonlight. I always feel safe at night, because bigfoot beds close to the house near my bedroom window.  It looks like a deer bed, but 8-10 feet long. I haven't seen him laying there, but I have been in the woods long enough to know what a \"bedding area looks like\"! He eats grapefruit off of the tree, sometimes leaving a large bite mark on a half of grapefruit (usually hanging three feet above my reach).",

It's still quiet wild with plenty of places for animals to hide. There has been some development in her area so some of the wildlife may be pushed even more so onto her property. We saw the area where she thinks one has bedded down but the yard was mowed and dry so it was a little hard to see it. Her neighbor was not home so I did not speak with him. The witness seems sincere and credible. The vegetable garden is no longer there (due to health reasons) and her Uncle has passed away. We will stay in touch with her and she will notify us of any new activity. ",
