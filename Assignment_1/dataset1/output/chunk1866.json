            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness who lives in a rural area of Shelby County. The area is rolling hills, woods and farms.  In August of 2012, he describes hearing numerous howls through the night.  He first heard howls at 2:30 am in the tree line behind the house. When he went outside to investigate, the howling began again.  As he eased himself back inside, he heard rocks pelting the porch over a period of seven to eight minutes.  Thereafter the howls were heard farther away at greater intervals from the house.  The witness is familiar with coyote sounds and stated that this was not from coyotes. I gave him the link to the howls on the BFRO website and he replied that they sounded most like the 1978 Whoop Howl from Snohomish County Washington. Click here for the Snohomish Recording Based on the tenor, quantity and veracity of the sounds, as well as the experience of being pelted with rocks, I am classifying this as a Class B experience. Please see report #36230 regarding the other encounter he mentioned.",
