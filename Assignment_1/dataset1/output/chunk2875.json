            "Observed": "Hi, I am 47 years old and I am a truck driver. I had an eye witness of something yesterday January 16 2013 in Clark Co. Ill.  I was driving down I-70 east bound around 7:30 am  when I noticed something in the field about 200-300 yards away.  It was black in color, fairly big but seemed to be squatted down with its back to me. At first I thought it was a bear but as I got closer its form resembled more of an ape like form.  Then before I passed it, it began to move away toward the woods.  As it moved it was moving like if you were to squat down and then try to walk while squatted.  I can't say that it was a big foot but I have no other explanation for it.  I have been hunting since I was 15 years old and I have seen a lot of animals but I have never seen anything like this and the way it moved.",

In summary: \u0095 The animal was very muscular.\u0095 The hair was black. \u0095 The weight was over 350 lbs.  \u0095 The witness estimated that the animal was at least 4 feet wide and at least 5 feet tall while it was squatted down in the field. \u0095 The animal was stooped over as it slowly moved away on two feet and into the tree line.

He was afraid that he would have trouble finding the stand and turned on his red light, he saw red lights that he thought was stand indicators but as he neared the stand, he saw the lights blink and hear something move away.  Neither of us knew what the other had experienced until we came back to the cabin about noon.  He said well, I think I had a bigfoot encounter, I said let me tell you about mine!",
