We had a couple strange experiences in a short period of time.  The first time, there were four of us.  We were out very late, close to 3 AM.  We were telling stories and trying to scare each other as we walked past the graveyard.  At one point we stopped and were standing around talking when one of us noticed a very large object in one of the trees.  After sitting and looking for a couple minutes we pointed a flashlight at the thing.  We didn't see anything clearly, but we didn't have much time.  It dropped out of the tree, maybe 20' or more.  It had been resting on a particularly large branch up in a very large tree.  It was gone so fast it didn't seem possible.  It took off straight to the patch of woods behind the graveyard.  A few hours later, when the sun came up, we went back to the scene.  I have been a hunter and in and out of the woods my whole life and know a thing or two about tracking.  I found impressions in the grass, very large ones.  I tried to match the stride and wasn't able to come close, neither was my friend who is over 6' tall.   Later one friend helped me measure my stride at a dead run and my height and I was able to use algebra to determine that the creature must have been between 7-9' tall.",
