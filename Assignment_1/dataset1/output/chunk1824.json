I did a Meet-up with someone who walked much faster than me. She left me at the power line. I was way downhill, but was determined to at least make it to the power line.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I conversed with the hiker over the phone for approximately 1 \u00bd hours. She was very straightforward, upbeat and enjoyed talking about her hobby of mountain lion research that has led her to multiple sightings of what she feels are Bigfoot tracks. She is a 67 year-old retired librarian and is currently an artist, writer and publisher. I found her to be sincere and credible.Her initial sighting of potential Bigfoot tracks on Mt. Ascutney in Windsor was just a hike for pleasure to unwind and enjoy nature as she had been taking care of her elderly mother. She had not been in the field for approximately 5 months (Dec 25th \u0096 May24th). The tracks she found were 15\u0094 in length and sunk between 2 and 4 inches into the ground, they were by a tree at a strategic intersection where the trail she was on crosses a set of power lines and comes within 100 feet of the auto road that goes up the mountain. She feels this was the perfect location for something to be able to hunt from as it had a hidden view of anything traveling up/down the power lines, hiking trail or auto road. On her way back to the parking lot she also observed a second large print with a smaller 10\u0094 footprint inside of it. She also found what she feels was a knuckle print from a creature leaning over for support similar to what gorillas do.Wanting to make casts she went to the ranger station where she spoke to the Park Ranger about what she had found and suggested he make a cast. He declined and the hiker left due to not having enough casting material and returned a couple of days later. Due to poor weather conditions her casts did not come out well and ended up breaking.The Park Ranger did acknowledge that there had been previous reports of Bigfoot activity but they \u0093try to keep it on the down low.\u0094 The hiker thought it odd that the ranger was at ease with Bigfoot activity but seemed quite concerned when she told him of mountain lion reports from the area. The ranger did have an incident where something shadowed him off the mountain one day just out of his sight. According to someone the hiker spoke with they mentioned that the ranger hoped it was a Bigfoot vs a mountain lion.The hiker had taken photographs of the prints and took measurements, as she carries a camera and tape measure even when not researching mountain lions. She willingly shared her photographs with me and sent them in a timely manner. I had the opportunity to visit Mt. Ascutney on Saturday July 30, 2016 approximately 14 months after her discovery. I was able to easily find the location of where she found her footprints and agree that where they were would be quite advantageous to anyone wanting to view the power lines, hiking trail and auto road. Unfortunately too much time had passed and I could find no trace of any footprints. While there the conditions were not ideal for footprints as the area is in the middle of a drought and there was a lot of leaf litter on the forest floor. I did find a couple of unusual tree manipulations that seemed odd and out of the ordinary. I have read other reports that attribute these types of manipulations to supposed Bigfoot activity.I hiked up the mountain approximately 1 1/2 miles from the parking area I was at to see the \u0093Steam Donkey\u0094, an antique piece of logging equipment that had been abandoned on the mountain in the early 1900\u0092s. What I found unusual was the lack of sound in the forest. I did not see or hear any birds or animals during the 2 hours I hiked and did not see another hiker.Upon leaving the mountain I stopped at the ranger station and asked about any reports of Bigfoot activity in the area. The young man I spoke with said he knew of no reported activity but also suggested I come back when the Park Ranger was there as he would know more about the happenings of the park.Mt Ascutney State Park has more than 3,000 acres of land and contains many species of both hardwood and softwood trees. It is supposed to be a great place to bird watch and has many animals including deer, moose and bear.  Due to its steep height it is also one of the premier hang gliding sights in New England. ",
