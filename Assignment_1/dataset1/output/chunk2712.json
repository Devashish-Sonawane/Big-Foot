            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness by phone. I noticed during the conversation he was reliving this incident and displaying a little discomfort. I have found this to be indicative of a truthful statement. He was coming home from work at about 11:15 at night. It was raining. He first noticed what he thought was a person walking in the ditch on the left side of the road. It crouched down and then stood up as he got close. He then noticed the figure was not wearing a coat, but he could see the long hair. He described the hair as rain matted. As he got close it stood up on two legs and then spread its arms straight out from its body as if a cheerleader were displaying a T during a cheer. It was then he could see what appeared to be a deer lying on the ground between the figure's feet. He did not see the face as he passed by but could only see lots of hair on its head. He continued down the road trying to figure out what he had just seen.  He could not offer an estimate of size only to say it looked like a person walking down the ditch in the rain. I found the witness to be truthful in answering the questions that I asked. I have made tentative arrangements to meet this witness and view the area. Incidently this is about three miles from a location where I and another investigator camped one night and heard distinct wood knocks ",
