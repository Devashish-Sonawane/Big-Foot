He said that he and his friend told the rest of the family about it the next morning, and that his mother was quite concerned.  I also spoke with her.  Both she and her son are very credible, and are agreeable to me making a brief on-site inspection at some future time.        In speaking with them both, another aspect of the encounter came out that was not included in the original report.  As the son and his friend were watching the BF, a car drove by.  Since then, the same car (from appearances) has been seen driving slowly down the road as if looking for something.  The witness and his family are trying to be ready if the car drives by again so they can talk to the driver.  They do not believe the driver knows that they saw the BF also.",
