            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness, a pastor, stated that it had rained earlier, the roads were slick and he was traveling around 50 MPH on his way to the airport.He was about two miles from the first toll booth when he saw a very large, silver colored creature about 10 feet from the road. The road does not have street lights, he was the only car and he had his high beams on.  The sighting is very close to a power-line road that runs parallel to the St. John\u0092s River. He slowed down further when he saw what was on the road ahead of him. He describes it as something totally out of the ordinary as he knows it was not a bear, cow, deer, hog or human. It had shoulders, \u0093wider than any body builder\u0094  he\u0092s ever seen.  It had a very large, broad back and was heading away from the road toward the fence. It appeared to be bent over at the waist, or possibly moving quadruped. It was on the north side of the road, moving as if it had come from the south. (Left to right.) It was totally silver in color, with hair that appeared to be coarse and just a few inches long. It was moving extremely fast, and about 10-15 feet from the shoulder of the road. The pastor assures me that it was far larger than any bear or gorilla he has seen in the zoo.Google earth image of the location:The area is a heavy traveled highway, and it goes through remote forest and wetlands. The area to the north is a wildlife management area bordering the St. Johns River area that has been the source of several recent reports. See reports #36004, #30679 and #38764.",
