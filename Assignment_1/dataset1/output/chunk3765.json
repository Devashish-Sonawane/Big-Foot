The mother and another sister have passed away.In summary:There was a series of events and sightings by the mother (now deceased), an uncle (now deceased), two sisters and two brothers. - The animal was described as being black, with long arms. - The animal was standing on two feet but would walk several yards and then squat, look around for several moments and then get up and walk several more yards.- When the young girl started yelling the animal appeared to start walking towards them.- The mother then ushered the children back into the house. - A couple of days later the children found footprints leading to some abandoned pig pens still on the property. The footprints went from one building to the next. - The footprints were in the 16 -18 inch range. - Hair was found on a nail near one of the windows. The family put the hair into a paper envelope. Over the last 47 years the family has kept this keepsake as a memory of that long ago summer. The uncle had sent some of the hair to a university but the family never heard any results from testing.The hair was sent by the BFRO for analysis and the results showed canine.  ",
