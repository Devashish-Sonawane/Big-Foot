The total duration of his sighting was about 15 seconds, from the time he saw the creature begin crossing the road until he passed it. He slowed the car but did not stop.The gait of the creature was described as \"\"smooth and fluid, swinging the arms like a human\". The arms appeared to reach past the knees. The head was \"cone shaped\" and he could not see any distinct neck or ears.The body build was described as \"muscular- not fat looking, just massive\". The hair  was described as \"dirty white\" and not particularly long.  At no time did he see any eye shine from the creature, he was not aware if the creature ever looked in the direction of his oncoming car.  When standing in the ditch, facing away from the road, the creature kept its arms at its sides. He did not notice any particular movement from the creature at this time.",

The group consisted of myself, my wife, my son, my daughter and a friend and his wife. The place we camped was on an elderly ladies farm. There were about 5 other campsites, all about 30 yards apart, with our campsite being on the end and closest to where the woods became thick. There was a dirt road that went from our spot into the woods a short distance. While myself and my friend were gathering fire wood, my son...about 7 at the time, sat at the begining of the road playing in the dirt.",
