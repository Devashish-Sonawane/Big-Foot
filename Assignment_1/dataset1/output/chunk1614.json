            "Time And Conditions": "I had went and hung a stand on a tree the day before,for hunting deer.  In an area around north sardis lake on public land.I knew I was the only person in there, because of the trails hadnt been used for some time.I rode in about 2 miles in and then walked about 300 yards to where I had hung my climber. It was just about day break, Iwas 20 or so feet up a pine tree when I heard what sounded like someone beating a stick against a tree. I spotted some movement in the area the sound came from,What ever it was was brown and tall,my first thought was its a bear.I was using my binoculars,but it was about 200 yards from me and dawn.So I pulled up my rifle to look threw the scope,hoping I could see it better.It wasnt any bear, it didnt have ears on top of its head and its face was flat. It was at least 8 foot tall and stood like a man.and I noticed its skin was grayish/green where the hair was thin. I was so startled I stood up.It turned toward my direction and knew I was there.It leaned Its head back as if smelling  the air, then took off. It move 40 or so yards in a few seconds and was gone.I was shaking badly and climbed straight down.I just coundnt beleive what I had seen.So I started walking in the direction I had seen it.I walked over to a hill where it had slid and left a track. It was a human looking foot track.This scared me because I was trying to tell myself, it was just a bear,then a sound came from the woods that sounded like whoop...whoop.So I hurried back got my stand and left those woods. That has been six years ago, and everytime I told anyone my story. They made fun of me, so I been reserved about letting anyone know, but recently.A freind f mine had an encounter,he doesnt want to let anyone know.Because he thinks people will think hes crazy... So I found this web site,and was amazed at how many have seen these things.",
