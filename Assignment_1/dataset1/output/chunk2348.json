            "Observed": "I'm a Native American from Montana. I live on the Flathead Indian Reservation. About two years ago I was hunting up on your mission mountains. The spot I was hunting is called North Crow. I was driving up through there looking for deer. I was coming to this corner and out of the corner of my left eye I seen him standing close to the road but still in a little bit of trees. I knew what it was. About a mile up the road ends, I knew I had to come back down. I was so scared to go back down but I knew I had to. I was driving pretty fast back down and did not look anywhere, just eyes on the road. I did not want to see him again. Have not been up there since this story I'm about to tell you is why I'm getting a hold of you guys. My little brother and my little sister and her boyfriend went hunting above Dixon. They ran into some elk and my little brother shot one. They were siting there gutting it out when a big rock was thrown on to the road. They said the rock was big, at least a 100 pound rock. They said the rock did not roll down, it was thrown. There is a lot of people around here that have seen and heard stuff too. You can call me and I can tell you more.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a Native American living on the Flathead Reservation. He filed his report from two years ago and also a more recent story his brother and sister told him. I encouraged him to have his family file a report regarding the rock throwing incident.In the fall of 2010, he drove in the Mission Mountains on a snowy day on Crow Road hunting.  Google Earth image of the area:The road is a dead end and was icy that day.  There was about two feet of snow on the ground and more wet snow was falling. The time of day was after 1 PM but before 3 PM. As he drove up and rounded a curve on his way up at about 40 mph, he saw a tall, dark brown biped standing at the tree line on the left side of the road. The tree line runs right up to the road, so it was just about 2 -3 feet from his truck. He felt it was so close that if he had reached out his arm he could have touched it. He always drives with his window open a crack no matter what the temperature.It was standing in between the trees and blended in very well, but was still visible. Its hair appeared wet from the snow, and it stood about 7 feet high. It had its right hand holding a branch as it stood there. He describes it as being \u0093very BIG,\u0094 in regards to its body build.His tribe believes that you must never look the sasquatch in the eyes, and he tried not to look at it. He was so scared he felt his body flush and turn cold.  The road was a dead end, and he was very apprehensive as he knew he would have to drive by it again on the way back down. Once he got to the end of the road, he gathered his wits, rolled up his window and drove down as quickly as he could. He was grateful it was no longer in the same place as he felt he couldn\u0092t have handled seeing it again.Every time he has driven to this location he has seen deer. This time he didn\u0092t see anything but the sasquatch.  ",

            "Observed": "Easter Sunday. My husband, two girls 6 and 9 years old and myself had completed our Easter visits with family and decided to take the girls out his family's land to let them be in nature and give him a chance to target practice. We drove through the gate on the dirt road until we came to an open pasture on the right (these pastures are planted for deer hunting) We parked the car in this open area. Walked back to dirt raod and went East to a little pond. Let girls see tadpoles and throw rocks ect. When from behind us, there was loud crunching in brush. We decided to move back toward the car. After hearing nothing more, my husband wanted to shoot pistol. We crossed dirt road immediatly aross from pasture where car parked to a deep ravine. I am 5ft 7 husband 5ft 10. The sides of ravine was over our head. We shot several times when suddenly, a large animal lunged into the ravine in front of us only about 10 to 15 feet. He paused, looked at us and then in one leap, jumped out of ravine. We froze for a moment then husband crabbed 6 year and I took the hand of 9 year old. We ran towards the car. And to our surprise, the loud brush noises inicated the animal was running toward our car. It stopped in brushline immedialty in front of our car. We unlocked drivers door and shoved kids in climbing in behind. One of my concerns is the descriptions I've heard are not the same animal we saw. This animal was grayish in color. Hair long about 5-6 inches. It wasn't very thick hair, seemed as if you could almost see skin through hair. Very wide shoulders, his upper arms were very long, linear and powerful looking. His thigh bones were also very long. Unlike the drawings of bigfoot, he had a short neck and round head. Far more human looking than the blocky thick shapes of drawings. The light was good. He jumped in ravine between us and the target.",
