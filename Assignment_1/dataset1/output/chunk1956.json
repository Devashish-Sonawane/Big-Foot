            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone about this incident, which still remains very vivid to him.  He and his friend were Air Force police driving home late at night on M-28, and near Seney they seen what they initially thought was a bear crossing the road.  This was around 1:30 AM, in the middle of winter.  There was an oncoming car illuminating the road in front of them, allowing them to witness the creature.  It stopped in the middle of the road and stood up to its full height and looked towards one of the cars (they couldn't tell which), and they noticed that it had extremely broad shoulders and a clearly defined head, arms and torso.  The witness estimated it stood around 6-7' tall.  It then continued walking off the road into the wetlands/forest.  When they drove past where they thought this creature was, they slowed and scanned the area for prints, but never left the car because of the cold; they were also a little intimidated by what they seen.   Nothing else was noticed. This area was described as being 'the middle of nowhere',  and is near the Seney National Wildlife Refuge.",
