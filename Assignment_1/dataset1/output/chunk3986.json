            "Follow-Up Report": "Here is a little more detail the witness was able to provide:\"It's size was great, I could only make out It's black shape slightly, shoulders up. I think the smell was similar to a wet dog that had rolled in something dead, but the machine had a distinct diesel and oil smell as well. I think the change in smell alerted me to something across from me.\"The witness recalls the color of the eyes as a bit golden, though he mainly remembers them as being very bright. Like, in his wording, \"a cat's eyes.\" In conversation with me, he estimated the height of the creature to be approximately eight feet. He remembers the weather conditions that day as warm and clear. There was no moon that night. He feels that the sighting occurred in August.Briefly, two things I would like to note:First, this is a very good example of a report on the cusp of being a Class A or a Class B sighting. It has been filed as Class B only because there was no clear visual of the creature. Second, I would like to say that, yes, BFRO would like to hear about older reports. Reports such as this provide useful, long-term information on a given area, showing sasquatch presence over time and possibly behavior patterns within a given area. No one with a thirty-year-old sighting should shy away from reporting it to us, as it could well prove quite useful.",
