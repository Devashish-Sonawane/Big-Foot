            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted Mr. C. in part because we have a shared interest in hunting.  Hunters must be aware of their surroundings and they must carefully blend into the environment in order to be successful.  This means that good hunters can make keen observers.  The witness is very helpful and was happy I contacted him.  Apparently he has tried to tell his story before but no one listened.Mr. C. had been hunting with his brother-in-law who shot a deer with his bow.  They went back to camp to give the animal time to expire rather than push it further into the woods.  After dark they took a Coleman lantern and began following the blood trail.  The trail abruptly stopped and the pair could find no other signs of the deer.  They noticed that there were no sounds in the darkness.  It was \"unusually quiet.\"  At this point the two heard \"deliberate and heavy\" footsteps as a bipedal animal paced back and forth. Mr. C. owns cattle and described the difference, \"You can tell they [the cows] are on four feet and are heavy, these footsteps had a similar heft.  I could tell it was heavy, not like a deer or other animals I normally see or hear in the woods.\"  He further added, \"At that time (late 1980's) there were no bears or elk on my property.\" The distance to the footsteps seemed to be about 15' and \"...it was sort of intimidating but not a threat or like a charge...it was as if it just didn't want us there and wanted us to go away.\" Mr. C's brother-in-law placed the lantern on top of his head so that they could both see off into the distance.  A \"very large humanoid\" figure appeared in the lantern light that Mr. C. described as being 7 - 7.5' tall and weighing at least 500 pounds.  The figure was dark in coloration but otherwise it was difficult to discern many other features.The figure stepped backwards out of the light and simultaneously let out an \"odd guttural sound.\"  The sound ...made the chills go up my shoulders and neck and the hair on my neck and arms stood on end.\"  This was the point at which Mr. C. drew his .44 revolver and the pair backed away from the scene.  That next morning they searched the area and found neither deer nor tracks of any kind.  Both surmised that the deer was taken by the figure they both witnessed.I sent Mr. C. sounds that he could use for comparison along with ones on the BFRO website but none were exactly the same as the vocalization he heard.On the second occasion in 2004 or 2005 a sighting occurred around 2 am in the same area.  This time it was also early in November and Mr. C. and his hunting partner were asleep in their cabin.  The hunting partner was awakened by the sound of something outside rustling a tarpaulin that covered the wood for the stove on their deck.  He looked out the window and was just able to see a large creature retreating into a cleared path that led to their deer blinds.  Mr. C. was unable to see the creature but noticed that his partner went to bed with a large hunting knife that night and he refuses to go into the woods to hunt or scout unless armed.",
