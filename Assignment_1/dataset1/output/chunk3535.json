            "Observed": "I was driving down a logging road, passing a J hole in the road. To my left BF caught my eye as it started to slide down the embankment, on its feet. Standing up, almost sking. I turned toward him, following him in my pickup, as close as his arm reach. Im not a journalist, so if someone would care to call me about this I would be more than happy to describe my encounter. I had a great view of him for 20 to 30 seconds, walking along side then in front on my pickup.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After interviewing the witness, the following can be added to his account. Witness is now a retired truck driver and he has hunted, fished and camped his entire life.  He and two other men were collecting firewood along the road for personal use. When the trucks were full,  the two other men got into their 2-ton and left. The witness followed about 5 mts. later.  He drove past a carved out section in the road that he and a small group had camped in the weekend before. They spent that weekend picking huckleberries which were heavy that year. The pullout has a 5 ft. high embankment.  As he looked in, he saw a Bigfoot step off the top of the embankment 30 ft. away.  Looking surprised, it grabbed some pine branches at the top and appeared as if it tried putting on the brakes. It slid down the embankment on its feet, its left foot slightly forward.  Once it got to the road ground, it started walking to head-off and get around the witness' pickup.  It met the truck as it was going about 5 mph and walked alongside it.  It was within arms length at this point. Its walking pace was faster than the truck and when it got a lead on the truck, it crossed in front of the vehicle.  As it entered the road, and crossed in front of the truck, it turned its upper body to the right then to the left, surveying the area.  When it was right in front of the truck, it held out its hand to touch the hood of the truck. The witness then slammed on his brakes and stopped. It stepped off the other side of the road and took very long strides into the undergrowth.  It had brownish red hair, mostly red, that was about six inches long.  Its face had very little hair on it. It had very big, black eyes and it made eye contact with the driver most of the time. He saw dark lips. He saw nothing to indicate the gender, but thinks it was a young male. What would be the belly button area was barely over the hood of his truck, a 1972 Ford pickup with off-road tires. The height was estimated to be 7 ft. tall. Comparing it to the Patterson film creature, he stated It was thick and stocky but not as big and the face was not as hairy. The entire sighting lasted 10-15 seconds.  Earlier in the day, the witness was picking up chains and tools along the road and had a feeling something was watching him, he assumed it was a deer.After the sighting he sat for a few minutes, the witness then got out to look for footprints. He couldn't find any. ",

            "Observed": "I worked on a dairy farm between Deersville and Tippecanoe, Ohio in Harrison County during high school. It was March, 1982 about 5:00 in the morning. There was a heavy frost on the ground, a full moon, and I could see fairly clearly due to the moonlight. I went to the outside paddock area to feed the replacement dairy heifer and started dumping the grain into the trough attached to the board fence when I heard a low grunt. The kind of grunt that someone makes from being in one position too long as you stand up. When I looked up, this figure was in the process of standing up. It was on the other side of a small creek that ran through the paddock approximately 50 yards away. The figure was standing next to the wooden hay feeder. It stood there for a few seconds then walked towards the other end of the pen closest to the woods. I only saw it for about 5 to 10 seconds but could hear it walking for approximately 30 to 45 seconds. I heard the sounds of footsteps crunching in the frost as it moved to the other end of the pen and then heard the squeaking sound of the fence being pushed down. The cattle were not spooked at all during this encounter and continued to eat. After we were finished milking, I went over to the hay feeder and couldn't find any prints in the ground as the frost was gone. The figure appeared to be approximately 7 feet tall which I estimated was a foot taller than me.",
