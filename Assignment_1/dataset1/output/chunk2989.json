It first started out, we were sitting near a fire we had built in our yard when I kept getting the feeling I was being watched..This was probably 9 or 9:30 at night. My partner asked me what was wrong to which I told him. A few minutes later, The cattle pastured behind our house started bawling and running like something either scared them or was chasing them. My partner stepped out to the side of the garage ( Which was beside the house ) and called me to come look, which when I got there, there was something tall standing in the moonlight. He then picked up a piece of steel pipe, his weapon of choice, and threw it at the shape, which did'nt move and we then assumed it was a pine or cedar tree. We went in the house shortly there after, but I still could not shake the \" being watched \" thing.",

They had only lived in the house about three days when the incident occurred, and were not yet familiar with the surroundings. The eight foot tall tree-like object was standing immovable only fifty to sixty feet away in the dim moonlight, but was gone the next morning.  Although there were two trails leading to the woods, no footprints were located.Very close by is Turkey Run State Park. The origin of the name \"Turkey Run\" is unknown but the most accepted theory is that wild turkeys would congregate in the gorges (or \"runs\") for warmth where early settlers in the area would trap them in dead end gorges and hunt them with ease.Photo taken at Turkey Run State Park -",
