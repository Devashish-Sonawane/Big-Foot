We passed it off as a harmless critter. A couple seconds later we heard a blood curdiling bellow-scream-screech, and we flipped our lids. As we began to run to the car, something that resembles what most people call bigfoot took off into the woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This evening, I contacted a young male, by phone, who stated that his initials were C. R.  I think he is a college student in Nevada, and is living in a dorm.  He claimed the encounter was an in and out affair.  I took that to mean, they arrived at their location and left a little quicker.I asked C. R. a few questions:*What was the precise location?  \"It was just off of I-80. We used the Farad exit in California, which is located about two miles from the Nevada border.\" *What features of the creature did you observe?  \"I seen the whole front side of it, but it was too dark to pick out any details. It was taller than me, and I am 6' 3\", and it was about seventy feet from us.\"*Could you tell what color it was?  \"No, because it was too dark, but I think it was dark in color.\"*Did you ever notice any smell?  \"No, I didn't smell anything.\"*Did you notice its ears? \"Didn't notice any ears.\"*Did you ever check for prints? \"No!\"*Can you describe the sounds it made?  \"The sound was like a scared dog going to a raging jackal.\"*How did you feel when you first saw it?  \"I felt scared and nervous.\"*Did you ever see it move? \"No, because I turned and ran for the car. I just heard it running into the woods.\"*Was there any one with you? \"Yes, two female friends.\"*Did they see the same thing that you did? \"I think so, but I know they heard it.\"Summary: C.R. said he heard something and thinks what he saw was a bigfoot.  C.R. stated to me they had not been smoking or drinking anything that might have caused them to think this was a hoax.",

He had just driven around a bend in the road near Fanning Springs, going about 40 mph when his headlights fell on the animal standing on the immediate side of the road. This witness assumes the figure was over six feet tall, but he stated it was hard to tell because the head was hunkered down a bit behind a shoulder, as if it was trying to shield its eyes and face.  He got the impression that the waist and torso were relatively thick. ",
