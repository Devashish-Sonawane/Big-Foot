Working the last stretch of bank before we called it a day when I heard something walking in the woods.  I could hear large footsteps and something that sounded like it was scooping water or slapping water, I really can't describe the sound.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Followed up with both witnesses on 1/1/12 and 1/7/12 on the telephone. Both men are experienced outdoorsmen and credible. Both men are familiar with Black Creek and the surrounding area. They met fishing on the creek several years ago, and now fish together regularly. One is a tournament angler. On November 20, 2011, the men went bass fishing. After launching the boat they headed east toward the railroad tracks. While fishing near the bank, they came upon a very foul odor. One described it as, \u0093musky dog,\u0094 the other as \u0093B.O. and a very dirty wet dog.\u0094 One of the men had fished the area the day before and had noticed the odor on that day too. (There is a land fill very close to the area, however both claim that it was not a \u0093dump\u0094 smell, and that they had never smelled the dump from the creek before.) They continued down the creek, only to return to the same area in the late afternoon. The smell was still in the air.From their boat, they then heard very heavy steps in the woods. Both men know the sounds of deer, bear and hog in the woods, and both claim the steps were much heavier.  Using a quiet trolling motor, the men moved the boat closer to shore hoping to see what was making the noise. One man heard small splashing in the woods as if whatever was making the footsteps was also stepping into a puddle. The footsteps stopped when they got near the bank. The woods were too dense to see into. After five minutes with no sighting, they moved away from the shore. Both heard a loud splash and think something was thrown at them, then the heavy footsteps were heard again.Black Creek is a 13 mile long tributary of the St. John\u0092s River. It is surrounded by heavily wooded wetlands. It rises in the Jennings State Forest from the north fork (a 23,995 acre forest) and from a lake on the south and east forks. Clay County has the second highest number of BFRO reports in Florida. Ten of the fifteen reports are in the Black Creek area, which has numerous creeks, ravines, and abundant wildlife essential for providing a prime sasquatch habitat. Satellite image of location:",
