The witness described the sasquatch as having been in excess of 6 1/2', the height of his father. It was brown to tan colored, not the color of the black bears common to the area. The witness said the animal had a massive build and a flat face.  It was hunkering in berry bushes on the side of a creek, possibly Poole Creek. At the time of the sighting, the witness did not talk about it for fear of the consequences of being in an area \"forbidden\" to him.As a curious aside, 3 1/2 miles to the west of this location is the \"Dread and Terror Ridge.\"",
