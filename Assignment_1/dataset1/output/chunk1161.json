The area in which the witness had her sighting is wooded and rolling. The figure she saw run past the window was about 15 feet out and level with her head, which would be about 10 feet from the ground.The only audible noises were the barks of dogs from her neighbor's homes on both sides.Several days before the sighting, she and her husband were awakened by a loud shreik near their front window. The bushes in front of the window appeared to have had something bedded down in them as the plants were \"swirled around\". There have been other sightings in Cleveland County and its neighboring counties to the south and west. The creek behind her property feeds into the Broad River.",
