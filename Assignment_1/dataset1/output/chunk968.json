            "Follow-Up Report": "It was around 12:30 pm on a clear fall day. Witness was driving east on US-90, he just crossed the Choctawhatchee River when he noticed an animal that was bent over on the hill coming up from a two-track on the right side, just passed Boat Ramp Road.  As the witness approached, it ran across the road on all fours. The witness stated the odd fact that as it ran, both the arms and legs worked in pairs. Both of the arms would come forward together and the legs would push off together in the same action.The distance was at least 200 yards when he first noticed it while driving at highway speed and not slowing down, observing the animal as it came up the hill and crossed the highway. The height was about 7-8 feet tall at best guess, thin build with very red hair. The hair was about 3-4 inches long, matted and would flop up and down as it ran. The head was kept down and appeared to be cone shaped.The witness stated that he knew of several people that had sightings in the area, but they did not wish to file a report.I know the area well, its a great habitat with plenty of resources.

            "Follow-Up Report": "11/23/06: Spoke with witness by phone for 25 minutes, and he seemed very sincere in relating his encounter. He also agreed to meet me at the location of his sighting, which has changed significantly in 30 plus years with the clearing of much land and the addition of several housing developments. The witness grew up in these woods, and hunted there since the age of 12.  Small game seemed plentiful, in addition to water moccasins in the marsh area and an occasional small alligator.  The following information can be added from our phone conversation and meeting at the location:The first encounter occurred when the witness was about age 18, roughly 1970, and he was not sure of the season.  The bipedal walking sounds were coming from just inside thick woods an estimated 30 feet away from him, and he did look into the woods but could not see anything.   He was age 23 (1975) for the second encounter, and had just gotten out of the Air Force, approximately November timeframe.  The creek area was about a half mile away from his home, so they had driven a car there, which was parked in a clearing.  He notes hearing some footstep type sounds in the woods on the way from the car to the creek, but had not thought much of it.  While heading back to the car for more gear, he clearly heard footsteps in the woods again, and when he reached the trunk of the car, the footsteps stopped.  At this point, he turned to where the sound had come from, and saw a hair-covered man-like creature about 70 yards away. The hair was dark brown, and he did not recall noting the hair length. He estimates the height was 6.5 feet, weight about 250 lbs, with obvious legs and arms.  The creature was just at the edge of the woods behind a small 10-12 foot tree, roughly 3-4 inches in diameter, and seemed to bend slightly to one side of the tree while using an arm to push a smaller tree branch forward away from its face.  At that point the witness turned his head toward the fishing hole to call to his brother and friend to come look.  Upon turning his head back to the woods the creature had disappeared and the witness heard loud footfalls heading away through the woods at a rapid pace, although he did remark that the sounds seemed to stop abruptly as if the creature had stopped in the woods.  They did go over to the area to look for tracks but found none, and they chose not to go into the woods to investigate further as he was fairly shook up by the encounter. However, he did not feel like the creature was dangerous or meant to harm him.  No unusual sounds or odors were noted. He notes telling some local friends about his experience, and they remarked something like \"Oh that sounds like Chicken Foot,\" which he thought referred to some local rumors passed by word of mouth but he is unaware of anyone else's encounter with any similar creature, other than his father's and the couple in the car as already noted.  He has not heard of any unusual tracks being found in that area.",
