These guys had good dogs but when we tried to turn them loose that would not go out of our sight and all 3 dogs returned to us within ten minutes and would not hunt, which was unheard of with these particular dogs.  This was probably around 2 months previous to my sighting.  We also heard what sounded to be rocks rollong down the hill in front of us which was very steep for no apparent reason.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness on the telephone and he added more details. The road was cut out of the mountain top and was at a lower level than the surrounding woods.  After being spooked by the coyotes and getting back in to his truck, the witness  rolled down the driver side window to hear something heavy approaching to his left from the woods.  As he turned on his headlights, the sasquatch strode quickly out of the woods from the left and hopped down into the road about twenty feet away. The sasquatch seemed to be taken aback by the presence of a truck because \u0093he\u0094 immediately froze facing the truck and assumed a linebackers pose (bent knees and arms shoulder width apart, palms facing each other and fingers pointing straight out).  The witness interpreted the reaction of the Sasquatch as something like, \u0093Oh, first I am being chased by coyotes and now I have this unexpected event to deal with!\u0094  The Sasquatch remained still for five to ten seconds in this position then quickly walked around the truck staying on the driver\u0092s side at a distance of twenty feet.  He moved from the front diagonal side of the truck along the side and ambled to the rear of the truck on down the long point and slipped into the hollow and out of sight.The witness felt that that is was a \u0093he\u0094 because it looked like a really big man. Gauging from some tree comparisons made later, the witness estimated the height to be from between seven and a half to eight feet tall.  The Sasquatch had reddish brown hair at a length of four inches all over its head and body. The hair pattern reminded the witness of someone in a ghillie suit, except it was obviously not someone in a suit.  The forehead was sloped back and the mouth looked ape like.  He couldn\u0092t see teeth but he could tell that it must have had huge teeth from the way the mouth protruded and the skin was stretched tightly over the lower face.  The face itself was sparsely covered with the same reddish brown hair.  As it passed him by with the window cracked, the witness could detect a slight musky scent but not overpowering.  As the Sasquatch moved past the rear of the truck, the witness rolled his window down, craning his neck to observe it move off over the hill.The coyotes continued barking before, during, and after the encounter.  The witness remained in the truck with locked doors until daylight.  When it became reasonably light, he left the truck and followed the path of egress to see if he could see anything else.  He did not find foot prints but did find the kind of skid marks you see when someone climbs down a steep bank in muddy, leafy conditions.  After a quick scout of the area, the witness loaded his black powder gun and continued on to his tree stand.  I asked him why he decided to hunt after this incredible experience.  He answered that if he had returned from hunting too early his dad would ask him why he came off the mountain and he did want to tell his father what had just happened.  His dad is a \u0093big time hunter\u0094 and his son was not about to tell him he found a Sasquatch instead of a deer.  The witness seemed to be genuine, articulate and reliable.Other stories:  A group of men were coon hunting on the same property in the early fall of 2010.  After they were released, the dogs ran into the woods and came back to the hunting party within five minutes begging to be put back into their boxes.  This was highly unusual behavior as these were expensive coon dogs, known to prefer hunting to anything else in the world.",

            "Observed": "I had gone backpacking/training trip with four pack animals in preparation for an extended backpacking trip into the Wemineuch Wilderness.  Two of my goats are experienced packers and two were new.  After several shorter treks I had gone to Spring Creek Pass where I planned to walk part of the Colorado Trail -- possibly down to Durango -- then resupply and go back to the Wemineuch.  After reaching one of the local creeks one of my goats started getting sick so I decided to head back toward the truck and bide my time while I assessed his situation.  There were tons of people on the trail last summmer and I wanted to be alone so I went off near Jarosa Mesa and found a meadow surrounded by thick forest where I didn't feel I'd encounter anyone.  We stayed two days.",
