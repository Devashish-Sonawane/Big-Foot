            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.  He had been fishing for about 10 minutes when he had the feeling of being watched.  He looked behind and saw what he estimates to be a nine foot tall hairy man-like animal standing up on the bank.  The creature was about twelve feet away from the witness.  The witness stated that the creature\u0092s hair was reddish brown in color and that its thighs were as large as the witness\u0092 chest.  He didn\u0092t get a look at the face of the animal as it turned and walked away when it noticed that the witness had spotted it.  The animal never made a sound when spotted, or when it walked off.  During the event, the witness was frozen with fear and couldn\u0092t scream.  Once the creature left, the witness ran off to get his friend.  They looked around a bit, but didn\u0092t find any sign of the animal.This area of Georgia has a very long history of sightings.  There are old newspaper reports of \u0093wildman\u0094 sightings from this area that actually pre-date newspaper reports of sasquatch sightings in the Pacific northwest.--------------------------------------Editor's note (MM): Sasquatches can be amazingly quiet when they are using familiar pathways. Some pathways will be used for stalking deer (or elk or pigs, depending upon the georgaphic zone). Those pathways will be noticeably well groomed, and very quiet to walk along.  Dry leaves, sticks, twigs, loose rocks, and any other debris that might make noise under foot while stalking animals will be conspicuously missing from those pathways, compared to nearby trails that are naturally littered with debris. Sasquatches will also use paved roads as stalking pathways at night -- desolate paved roads in unpopulated forest zones with no traffic at all, or after traffic has completely died down. They use paved roads for stalking deer, elk and pigs because those animals will walk along paved roads at night also. Dirt roads: They will only walk on dirt roads where they won't leave obvious footprints behind. They will prefer to walk on the more solid dirt roads, even if uncomfortably bumpy from gravel. They seem to avoid, muddy, sandy, or otherwise loose surfaces, but sometimes cannot avoid it, in which case they'll leave stunningly clear obvious footprints behind.Loose surfaces are unstable surfaces, especially for heavy animals. Gravel roads are the most stable surfaces, after paved roads. Gravel roads in mountainous provide the greatest efficiency for foot travel in those particular environments, and are quiet and leave no discernable tracks. They were usually built for large logging trucks, so they have thick layers of chert and gravel. Roads made for large logging trucks don't have many large soft spots, unless you are walking along the very edge of the road. You can walk a long way on most logging roads without leaving any footprints behind yourself, and you will be fairly quiet as you walk, compared to the amount of brush crashing you make if you were to walk off the road, cross country, at the same pace.Sasquatches also have padded feet -- padding that not only insulates the foot in the cold months, but also helps to dampen the sound of debris crunching under foot in the warmer months.",
