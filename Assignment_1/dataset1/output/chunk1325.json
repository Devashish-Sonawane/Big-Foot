            "Observed": "I'm posting this on behalf of my wife, on a friend's computer.  Recently my family relocated to land that we own -- upon which we are in the process of bulding a new house.  Despite the noise of nailguns, etc., as weird as it might appear, my wife claims that at approx 4:30pm CST, on the last Saturday of the year, 29th?, she went for a walk in the woods.  This was not an ordinary walk, because we live right at the edge of a forest/woods that surrounds a lake.  We are located  NW of Paris, Texas, in Lamar County.  Anyways, she went for this walk in the woods because it was her first walk of the season. We are affraid to go down into the woods during the summer, as it is snake infested.   So we usually wait until it freezes before we venture...   It was down around 30 to 40 degrees that day.  Our land is a pretty chunk of property.  It backs up within 1/2 mile of the lake.  We are the last owners on our road.  Uncle Sam is our neighbor.  I believe the land is part of the State of Texas' Wildlife Management land, and the Army Corp of Engineers, actually built and own the lake.  My friend is telling me now that the area adjoining this lake  is approx 19,000 acres +.  Anyways, thats the rough conditions here in Lamar County.  Heavily wooded and open pasture mix.  Lots of snakes.  Moderate climate.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke directly to the witness a few days after she had her experience.  She stated to me that she saw it through the binoculars two times... in both cases, it appeared hairy, had a round head but she couldn't see the eyes because the view of the head was obstructed by some vegetation.  It appeared to be looking right at her approximately 50 to 75 yards away or \"half to three quarters the length of a football field.\"       She said she had her dog with her initially but he turned back to the house and she attributed that to his age (12 years old) and her cat did accompany her on the walk and it behaved normally.   There was much vegetation that she looked through but she felt that this thing was seen clearly through the binoculars.  She mentioned  that it was brown in color, it looked to have frozen in a stance in which it was bent over and staring at her.  It may have fallen out of a tree or was picking something up the ground.... or so it looked to her.Asked about body build, she said \"just kind of poorly\" indicating not heavily built.  It also looked as though it had narrow to medium wide shoulders.    Although curious about its behavior, she continued  with her walk without incident about ten minutes after she last saw it.  Although the sun was going down and it was getting darker, she really wanted to go for the walk.    .    ",
