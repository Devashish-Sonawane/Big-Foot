The witness watched the creature through his riflescope until it came within 120 yards, then the witness watched it with his naked eye.  Closest point was 80 yards.  --The creature\u2019s body was trim and strong, with well defined muscles.  Shoulders were very wide.  The witness reemphasized that the waist was very tiny compared to the shoulders.  The neck appeared human.--There were several bald spots on the creature:  on the back, shoulders, and arms.  The entire back of calves and feet were bald.  The rest of the hair was just long enough to cover the skin.--The creature never appeared to notice the hunter at all.",
