            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to this gentleman over the phone and have these details to add. The witness stated he saw nothing at first but soon spotted 'a tall, black, man-shaped creature' that was standing on two legs.  It was looking at them from about 300 yards away, standing on the edge of the woodline between some trees. He described it as being muscular, about seven feet tall, with broad, athletic shoulders. It had long arms that hung down to its knees and it was covered in a uniform black color, which he recalled as being 'smooth'. He vividly remembered its head was 'pointed at the top' and that its eyes were of a blackish hue that 'glowed' in the sunlight. He did not look at it for long before they all three ran into the house.Upon investigating a map of the sighting area, I found it to be mostly farmland with plenty of bogs, creeks, rivers and a series of connected woodlands nearby. It is within 15 miles or so from some large wildlife protected areas and several state parks. It is within 15-20 miles from the Mississippi River, which has several tributaries that run through this area and the Bayou Cocodrie National Wildlife Refuge area.I also found another report from the same Franklin Parish that occured in the same year, Report #2388.",
