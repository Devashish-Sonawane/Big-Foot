The screams only went on for a minute or so, but what surprised me was that my father, who has lived in Stevenson his entire life and knows the woods and the local animals well, did not have any idea what was making that sound.  I was 17 at the time, but just recently, my teen age daughter, who has an interest in such matters, played me the 1978 Snohomish County recording of",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. He was able to add additional  information.   One vocalization was heard that night, beginning low in tone, gradually rising in volume and pitch, then ending abruptly .    He stated it lasted three to four seconds and was extremely powerful and easily heard above the sound of the TV.   The call came from the northeast, behind the house up on the ridgeline.  The father and son looked at each other.  \"What the heck was that?\"   Both are familiar with all animal sounds in the area, and this was something they state unknown to them.   The home is located on the outskirts of town and has large acreage surrounding it.  On the uphill ridgeline side of the home is a large field surrounded on three sides by timber.  A good sized creek flanks one side, and the upper portions of the property were once  orchards.  Available fruit trees in season include, apple, pear, plum, cherry and walnut. The past 2 to 3 years in summer season a rhythmic, deep, repetitive breathing is heard certain evenings on the outdoor balcony.   It is said to emanate from the tree line within 100 feet of the home.  Night vision goggles are now in use to help identify the sounds \"made by the Breathing Monster,\" so nicknamed by the residents.    Possible seasonal gathering may occur in this area, and the family will continue to monitor activities.",
