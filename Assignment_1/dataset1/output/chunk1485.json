The witness and his family spend a significant amount of time outdoors. They tent camp at least once each month, all year long. He had visited Sherwood Lake on several occasions in all seasons.  He observed a mountain lion and cub on a spring camping trip to Sherwood.Once during a winter camping weekend he discovered eight holes through the ice which resembled a track-way. They lead across a short section of the lake, beginning where it looked as if something had slid down the embankment to the ice. The holes were spaced at an interval he could not match while walking on the frozen surface. The witness' dogs mentioned in this report were Rottweiler and Pit Bull. Neither breed is recognized as timid and they have not repeated the abnormal behavior. ",
