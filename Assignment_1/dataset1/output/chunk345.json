He takes old maps and overlays them with the new ones in order to locate his target areas. The plantation ruin he visited in July is only reached by boat as the tide dictates the area's accessibility. The witness and his friends had split up over the area and were wearing headphones in order to listen to their metal detectors. The witness did not have the frequency up high when he heard the first vocalization. He recounted being watched and a powerful smell came over him.  The woodknocks came from two separate directions with the closest one 100 yards away from him. He radioed his friends and they heard nothing. The witness had a feeling about what could be in there with him and did not feel it was menacing.  He recalled the first time being in the area finding boar kills. The kills were near one another and the stomachs were ripped open. He recalled the scene as very unusual. The area the men were relic hunting in is listed as a plantation ruin in coastal SC. It is surrounded by swamp and impenetrable with vegetation in places. Cyprus and Oak trees create a thick canopy overhead. Large venomous snakes, gators and wild pigs lend to the area's inhospitality.The witness sent me photographs of his find.",
