            "Observed": "hello. some time back i submitted a report about strange noises i and my family had been hearing over the years. i spoke with someone on the phone from bfro about it and informed him that my father had actually seen a bigfoot here in the past. well, much to my shock and horror i have seen one too. i was checking on my children in their bedroom last night at about 1:00 in the morning, when i saw the motion detection light we have mounted on the outside of the house go on. where my childrens bedroom is it is right against a hillside that leads to very dense woods. anything can walk out of the woods and onto a small porch that we have off of my childrens bedroom. well, anyhow as i was saying, i was checking on them and there is a window that you can look out onto this porch {it is on the second floor, but up against the woods} and also a door for access.when the light came on i instinctively looked over to the window because i knew whatever had set it off would be either there on that porch or in the woods. it goes off if a raccoon or a cat scurries by so itis not uncommon for this to occur. when i looked over to that window i could not breathe. all i could see was a massive, coal black, very shaggy haired creature standing there on two very bulky legs looking in the window at me. i felt very frightened, as this window is only about 6 feet from where my childrens beds are. i could not see anything but the two legs and the rear end of this thing because the window has a blind on it that was halfway down. it is one of those straw blinds that you can see through partially. with the light shining behind this thing i could make out the perfect outline of it's upper body. i am about 5 feet tall and this thing was, i am guessing, about 8 feet tall because it towered over the window. it just stood there for a brief moment and then went in the direction of the woods. i was too scared to go over to the window and look and see where it went. i took my children into my bedroom last night and i laid awake in fear all night.what i keep remembering is the muscles and the bulk in the legs. the rear end {the butt} also was quite muscular. and that ratty coal black fur. there was no smell at all and it made no noise. i am sure that the light coming on suddenly spooked it, but i got the impression that it was curious as to what was inside my home. it gives me the shakes to think of it. it was a cold winter night last night, but the ground was still muddy so i mustered up some courage this morning and went looking for tracks.i found some long slide marks on the hillside as if something had slid down the mud. no distinct footprints though.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken with this witness and have found her to be credible.A motion sensing light was installed in October to shine on the hillside after hearing an assortment of odd noises coming from the surrounding woods the past summer.  These noises included long, deep screams, breaking branches, and once the source of the screams imitated an ambulance siren that was passing in front of the property.The house is located part way up a hollow so that it backs up against a steep hillside.  I spent a number of minutes having the witness describe the layout of the house and the porch to understand this arrangement.  The porch is supported by a poured concrete and cement brick retaining wall which is flush with the hillside.This incident began when the witness had walked down the hallway to visit the restroom.  As she returned the motion light went on and she stepped into her son's room to look out the window.  The window begins at two feet above the porch and is approximately three feet wide by four feet tall.  The witness could directly observe portions of the leg to about midway up the torso of the animal.  The outline that was visible behind the window shade ended before the top of the shoulders.  The witness further stated it was as wide as the window before it turned and moved off.  The bulk of what she saw left a lasting impression upon her.No other incidents have transpired in the last month.",

            "Observed": "My family (5) and I go on vacation every year. One year we decided to go to Colorado on a camping trip. We also would always our dog and this year my brother took his rat.  After a long trip across Kansas, we finally crossed the border to Colorado. We headed to Colorado Springs. We were going to stay at a camping trip, but as usual we found a place to set up camp away from any sites or towns. It was pretty secluded where we were. Our camp site was surrounded by woods except to the east there was a long field. Now it was the very first night and we had two tents. In one tent was my Parents and my sister. In the other tent was my brother his pet rat and I. We ate a good meal of hot dogs and s'mores. A sitting around the fire for a little while, we went to bed. It was a very clear night and I remember how bright the moon and stars were. I really ever heard of \"bigfoot\" or paid to much attention to it before. It seemed like I hadn't had much sleep before I awoke to find my brother's rat digging around in the bag at the top of the little pup tent(my brother let the rat run around in the tent). Its rustling is what I think woke me up. So I got up to take him out, but I froze as did my blood. I was suddenly wide awake. I just stared because to the left of me I saw the silouette of a tall two legged creature through the door( we had zipped up the screen and left the cover off ).  I was and still am sure that it was not a bear or any other animal, and I am especially sure it was no human. Its arms were shorter than its legs and it was covered with hair. I got the feeling it was alarmed because right when stopped a jerked its head and walked speadlily away. My eyes were glued to it and I watched its every move. It walked away towards the field, turned around, and I lost sight of it. I can still remember thinking about the way it moved. It definatly was not normal. It bent at the knee and when it turned, it seemed like its whole upper body moved around. Of course the next day when I told my family no one believed me, but I know and I have known that it is a fact that sasquatch is real and is a living breathing animal. I also believe that it is not a threat. I definatly encourage people who are trying to bring sasquatch into reality for others for the right reasons. Ever since then I been very interested in it and cryptozoology.",
