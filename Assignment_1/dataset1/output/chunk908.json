The animal looked \"dirty\" and the fur was strawberry blonde in color.-The eyes appeared to be brown. The nose was wide and dirty. The face was fur covered and the animal seemed to have a \"mustache\" covering the mouth.-Head had a \"nice curve to it\" and the neck was not visible.-After losing sight of the animal, the witness estimated the height of the animal using his own height. The witness is 6'2\" with a reach of  about 7'6\".
