            "Observed": "Approx. summer of 2000, I was on Negus Mountain in Rowe, MA (Franklin County) with my wife, sitting on the tailgate...we heard something in the woods, about 100 yards away, walking towards us.  As it got closer, it started to walk faster.  As a life long hunter, I at first told her not to worry, it's a squirrel or something.  As this creature got closer, my ears and experience told me that this was a biped, only 2 feet crunching through the leaves.  My wife was so freaked out that we had to leave immediately before I could investigate more.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness at great length over the phone. He seemed to be very credible and willing to discuss his experiences. He told me about the first encounter that his wife and he had had where something was moving in the woods coming towards their location. Having been a hunter all of his life, this sounded to be a large bipedal creature that made heavy footsteps. His wife had a very uneasy felling about being there and they both left without ever getting a clear look at it. His second encounter took place several years later while he was driving to work late at night. He only saw the creature for a few seconds as he drove past. Google Earth Image of the Area:According to the witness, it was approximately six to seven feet tall with dark brown hair covering its entire body. The fur was very shaggy looking and seemed to be a few inches long. Although he said he never really got a clear look at the face, he knew that it wasn't a bear or a person standing by the highway at night in the rain.  When he turned around to go back for another look, it was gone. I have have been out to both areas that the witness had his encounters. On both occasions, I heard wood knocks near to my location. The second time I was investigating the area, I did observe large tracks near to a hiking trail that lead up the mountain into a rocky outcrop. The tracks were too melted out to be sure if they had indeed been made by a sasquatch. This bridge is on the edge of the Mohican Trail State Forest, over 6,000 acres of mountain ridges, deep gorges and tall old-growth trees. ",
