            "Follow-Up Report": "Witnesses were interviewed by phone on March 3, 2011.Witnesses were a husband and wife driving home at night.  I spoke with the husband first and he described the biped's height of 7-8ft tall.  Witness estimated its weight at around 400-500lbs.  It was black in color and he stated its arms were as long as his (witness') legs.  \"It moved like a gorilla\" he stated.  He was surprised he didn't hit it with his vehicle.  He thought it crossed the road east to west in about \"one leap\".  It never faced them so they didn't get a look at its face.  Witness stated it seemed not be concerned as they drove by heading north at about 55mph.I then spoke with the wife who saw it first alerting her husband who was driving.  Her description was consistent with her husband's.  Since the sighting, she describes the creature she saw to others as looking like a \"caveman or Bigfoot\".",
