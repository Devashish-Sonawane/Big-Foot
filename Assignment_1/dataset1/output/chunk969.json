This area is not easily accessible because of the terrain and the road being obstructed by snow in some areas.  As I was coming back down the canyon I came to an open spot along the side of the mountain heading into a more wooded area next to a meadow. The meadow was about 300 yards away.  I was looking ahead of meyself at the beginning of the wooded area  when I saw a human like creature cross the road heading towards the meadow. Its gait was very unhuman like bent at the waist and  arms swinging like you might see a vaudeville actor do at the end of a show as they exit the stage, a bit looney tunes like. I observed it for about 3 to 4 strides. It was all black, long arms (longer than ours), tall, muscular, and slim with no neck visible. It must of been at least 7 to 8 ft. tall and weighing about 400 to 500 lbs. I reached for my camera and that is when I saw it cross back over the road again this time in a slow more human like gait like it was trying to elude something without illiciting a chase response from whatever it was trying to elude like you might do if you saw a growling dog.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness is a former marksman in the US Marine Corp. He is currently a traveling medical professional very familiar with human and animal anatomy. As a former marksman he is very adept at judging height, size, and distance.  The animal was covered in 1.5\u0094 - 2\u0094 of fur that was black in color: \u0093almost a blue black\u0094. It was lean and very muscular and he felt it was a younger more adolescent animal between 7-8ft t in height and between 400-500lb.  He says it was definitely male as the pectoral muscles were easily visible and very developed. He was keenly aware of the movement of various muscle groups underneath the hair including the shoulders, thigh, chest, and waist. The animal had no visible neck and he states that the conical shaped head pretty much sat directly onto the trapezius muscles. The arms were \u0093easily at knee length and it seemed as if the it was using the exaggerated movement of its arms to propel itself forward almost like I do when I\u0092m hiking up a hill\u0094.I asked the witness if it was possible that this could have been a person in a suit to which he chucked, \u0093No way. Everything was too perfect: the height, the weight, the size of the muscles, the gait\u0085everything was proportional and worked as expected for an individual of that size. The muscle groups were all there working properly, the hair appeared to be attached to skin and skin attached to muscle and all of it was a part of this animal. Nothing was sitting or stretched over a structure\u0094.",
