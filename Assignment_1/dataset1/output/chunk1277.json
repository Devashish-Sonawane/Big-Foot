This sound came from 30 yards away.When he heard this he ran to his house. He stopped before going inside, turned and looked around. This is when the pine trees parted and the animal stepped through them and stood there. At this point the animal was between 50 to 60 yards away. He described the animal as 10 feet tall with a width at the shoulders of approximately 4 feet. The light from the street lamp silhouetted the animal and the witness said it was dark colored. This happened in a 5 second time frame. At this point the he entered the house.His cousin, who was home at this time went outside a short time later but did not see anything. The cousin told him that he was crazy. However, a month or two after this sighting the cousin came back and told him that he was NOT crazy, as he had seen something in the area.There are several gravel pits, a creek, ponds and lakes in this region. Food sources are plentiful, with the water sources and farms nearby.",

The ridge we were on was fir trees and heavy brushy groundcover, and the area between us and the flat at the bottom of the ridge could not directly be observed. As we were watching the flat below us for signs of elk, I heard what I thought was two hunters slowly walking up the ridge and softly talking to each other. I could not make out any words, only the soft murmuring sound of a voice. I told my son, who was to my left and about ten feet from me, that I hear two hunters coming toward us and we'll let them come up so they know we are there.",
