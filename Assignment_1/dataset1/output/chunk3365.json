            "Observed": "As my friends and I sat around our campfire, about 3 miles from the trail head at a flat, well trampled site, we heard a group of low based voices \"mummbling\" down the hill and braking large sticks. When the voices drew closer to our camp we heard them change to a more high pitched tone, possibly suprise and uncertainty. Since it was spring the river was swollen and my companions dismissed the noise as something like \"stream garggle echo.\" But when it suddenly stopped there was a great abscence of sound and the river couldn't reproduce the noise. I then witnessed large tall shadows move through the trees and down the bank to a flat granite river bank. It was then that what I can only describe as a \"protest dance\" began. The sasquatch began stomping with enough force to almost bounce me up and down on a log seat and the chants grew loud, spirited and quite hysterical. The seat I was on was a thick log supported on either side, about seven feet apart by other logs, that literally bounced when the\"protest dance\" began. The message of their chant was unmistakable in any language : \"GET THE --== OUT!\" So much that I declared, \"whatever that is doesn't want us here, let's just pack up and go!!!\"",
