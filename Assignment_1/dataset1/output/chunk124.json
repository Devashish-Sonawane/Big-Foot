            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.The witness and fellow hikers found a little cave. Then one-half mile ahead, they found a dead elk about two days old. One-quarter to one-half mile from the dead elk they found on mossy ground, sawgrass that appeared to be placed. It was eight feet wide, nine feet long and pressed down to three inches. They did not find any hair, but there was a musty smell like mold and urine. They found four to five tracks over six feet apart that started by the nest, then went onto a deer trail and then into the bushes. Four to five toes showed in these footprints. The tracks were in dry forest floor and one half inch in depth.The witness described the knocks simply as trees being hit. The hikers heard three knocks, one minute apart, each at a different location. The first was to the upper left and the other knocks moved in front of them. The hikers also heard some sticks breaking. The witness took these two photos. He placed his handgun next to one track. The barrel length is six inches.I found the witness to be very observant and credible.The location of this report is in the same general area as Report #42647.",
