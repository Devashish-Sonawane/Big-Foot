When most kids were scared about leaving a light on, I was sleeping under the stars. When I was 14 my father would take up in the mountains leave me and come back in a week. I knew how to survive and feed myself. I've seen some beautiful sights in nature and also those that defy it. I'm not an English major as you can tell by my spelling, but I do know nature.  I do know what I saw, and I know man. He has a tendency to destroy what he's afraid of or doesn\u0092t understand. That\u0092s why I've only talked about the one incident until I'm sure whoever contacts me \"is for real\" and not writing a fiction book. I have a great respect for nature. It must be some of the Indian blood in my veins. I wish more people had it.  Maybe our environment would be better and a lot more animals not extinct. I will say after the first incident, the other two were able to make me see that you never stop learning about life.",

            "Observed": "First encounter was east of Brigham City, Utah, above a place called upper docs flat.  Had been hiking with a friend. His name is Kenny A.  I do not wish to use his last name without his permission.  We had been hiking all morning going higher and higher through the valleys, zigzagging back and forth.  At one point we went up a spine or ridge, and at the top of this spine was an old cabin.  I think it was referred to as the old sheep herders cabin. In front of the cabin was a small pond. Hiking our way towards the cabin I stopped at the pond. The water was clear and suitable for drinking, maybe fed by a natural spring.  My friend started to cup his hands to drink, and did so. I started looking around the pond which had a smooth dirt skirting around it. I then asked Kenny if he noticed anything wrong with the pond, and he said no. I said, \u0093look were you knelt\u0097you left tracks.\u0094 I said, \u0093do you see any other tracks around the pond?\u0094 At such a location there should be tracks everywhere, but there wasn\u0092t\u0097not even bird tracks. We also noticed that there were no sounds, birds, squirrels etc. Kenny was starting to get nervous at my finds. Although he was a friend, he didn\u0092t have the outdoor curiosity that I do.",
