            "Follow-Up Report": "The first thing that entered Derek's mind when he had his sighting was who is that?  Upon getting closer and hearing his friend's question repeated, he told me, \"It was more likewhat is that?\"    He approached close enough to see the wind blowing the creature's hair around.  I asked about the general appearance of the animal and was told \"I couldn't see the eyes because  that area was very dark and covered with hair.\"He mentioned that the head did suggest being pointed or almost.   The animal was thickly built with heavy legs.  He mentiioned it had no neck.  The color was a brownish gray.  When he approached it he mentioned  two things to me.  The first was  he didn't think he could shoot.  It was so manlike and it wasn't \"doing anything.\"Secondly,  if he used the weapon he had along it would have had a  minimal effect  which he wouldn't have felt comfortable about.   He was just out of the Marines and full of energy during the time he had his encounter.  Upon the approach of it he mentioned it took two quick strides and it was gone.  Although manlike, it seemed to have the longest hair on its trunk (body).   Also, he thought it might be somebody playing a trick on them since it was so close to Halloween.   What changed his mind quickly was the way it moved and where it went.   It leaped into a series of wild malty... rosebushes with thorns.   It tore right through and it wouldn't be something that a person would do in Derek's opinion especially with the length of stride and speed exhibited.   He also mentioned smelling an odor.   This area was on the edge of the Hoosier National Forest.",

            "Observed": "I was at a friend's house in the Colton area. It was around midnight when I noticed strange noises in the treeline approx. 100 yards from his house. These noises were birdlike in nature and seemed to be coming from 3 places, directly in front of the house and off to both sides and further away. These noises sounded like birds but were only part of a bird call, and they seemed to be answering each other. There were 5 different noises and while they seemed birdlike they definitely came from something larger than a bird. At approx. 12:30 am I finally asked the other people at the house to come outside and listen. Everyone agreed that the noises were strange and like nothing they had ever heard before. We shined a flashlight in the area that noises seemed closest and saw nothing due to heavy brush, but the noises quit in that area until we stopped shining the light. These noises lasted until approx. a half an hour until dawn and quit quite suddenly. I grew up in the area and spend alot of time hunting and fishing and being in the outdoors, as does the property owner, we could not identify any local animal that makes these noises. In the morning we went and looked in the area closest to the house and found want could 2 possible tracks, they matched nothing we had ever seen, and we compared them with the other animal tracks in the area and they matched nothing, also noticed that the grass was pushed down in approx 3-4 foot strides running through the field behind the stream area where we found the possible tracks and where we thought some the noises were coming from. Since then the property owner has heard the same noises at night and last night heard something thrashing around in the brush. Also, if this has any bearing, there has been a good deal of logging in the area we thought that perhaps something has been pushed out of that area. Thank you for your time.",
