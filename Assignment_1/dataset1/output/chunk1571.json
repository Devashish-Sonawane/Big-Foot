            "Observed": "It was June 18th, 2021 about 4:00 pm at Mohican State Park, Loudonville, Ohio in Ashland County. My best friend and Idrove into the picnic area at the Covered Bridge, and there were no campers, hikers, or people fishing, so we drove into Campsite B, its a narrow road that is parallel to the Mohican River. Then we reached the end of this road where there is a turn-around, so we parked the car and shut off the engine. The front of the car was facing towards the Covered Bridge and the Mohican River was on the driverside of the car, and the thick woods were on the passenger's (my side) and to the rear of us. Also, it was an unusually chilly day for the month of June and it was very cloudy, with no sun and a slight drizzle of rain. So, we sat in the car with the windows down, we could hear birds chirping and the soft babbling sounds of the river. We sat there for about 30 minutes, talking away as women do and I mentioned that I watched a Bigfoot show on tv and we should do \"bigfoot calls\". So, jokingly I started doing whoop whoop calls and it echoed in this small area, we laughed for a couple of minutes then took a drink of our pop and we heard two tree knocks, not loud but not soft. Instantly, I was scared because the sound was very close to us, it was about 30 feet up in the thick woods, and it was very steep, almost straight-up. I knew this was not a person because it's too dangerous to climb. This spooked both of us so we started the car and went back to the Covered Bridge picnic area which is more of an open area. Also, there were a few cars so we did not feel alone, and my friend had to use the restroom and I stayed in the car. The woods were still on my right side and I could hear birds chirping loud and fast then all of a sudden they stopped. Then a rock that was about 6 inches wide came tumbling down on the ground of this steep cliff along with dry leaves falling behind it. So I looked up and about 15-20 feet away I saw the left side of a foot, calf, thigh, and hip of an animal. It looked like it was slipping on the leaves and was trying to gain traction and its leg went straight up and behind a tree. This leg looked like a bodybuilder's leg with short black hair and was about 3-4 feet in length. Then my friend got into the driver's side of the car and we left. So, when I got home I looked up videos on youtube of bears. My leg sighting does not match a bear leg because the hind leg of a bear or dog has an odd angle from the pad of the foot to its leg. But what I saw was a human-like foot with hair that connected to a calf, to a knee, to a thigh then to a hip, and it was super muscular. Also, there have been NO bear sightings in Mohican State Park for many decades.",
