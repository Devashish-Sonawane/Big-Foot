            "Follow-Up Report": "Called and talked with C.G, tonight, May 31, 2007, and we went over his sound encounter up in the Monache Meadow area of the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains.  The witness holds a high profile position in a large firm in Southern California, and his late night sound encounter seemed very believable and credible, because he also went to the trouble to locate and then listen to several audio clips before he settled on the 1974 sounds. The loud echoing whoops that were heard by he, and his wife, and one of his children, gave him the impression of being belligerent  compared to the 1974 whoops which were comparatively docile.\"It sounded like one of the coyotes was being chased down and caught, and them torn apart. There was another vehicle camped just south of us about 200 yards away, but we never made contact with those people, because they had been firing off there firearms before bed time, so we didn\u0092t want to have anything to do with them. Also, the following day, there were several people repairing fences that probably held cattle but they were to the north of us.\u0094 The lower half of California is in the midst of an extended draught, compared to previous years. One of the few, totally reliable sources of clean running water on this part of the Kern Plateau is the South Fork of the Kern River. It runs from North to South through this 8000 foot elev. plateau. The river is located fairly close to where the witnesses were camped.  This investigator has camped, rode motorcycles and hunted deer around Monache Meadows for well over three decades. Monache Meadows has had a few sightings and sound encounters over the last few decades. ",
