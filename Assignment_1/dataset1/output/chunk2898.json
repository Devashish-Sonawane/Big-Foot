There was also some vocalization made that did not appear to have been made by a human. If you can imagine the gobble made by a shack tube, then that is the closest thing I can imagine. I know that there are many people out there that have been in the woods more then me. But I know the sounds of almost all the indiginous animals in Arkansas. This was something that, at that time, I have never heard.",

Now, take into consideration that it was walking up an incline when I noticed it.\"\"The only thing that I can conclude as to what it was doing at the time I saw it was possibly trying to relocate due to the fact that there was logging going on in the location it was coming from, or possibly investigating what the loggers were doing.\"\"At the distance I was at, I could not see the specific details of the face. I did notice that the head had a slight conical shape to it.\"In a final telephone interview the witness clarified a few items and added others as follows:The \"shack tube\" mentioned above should have been a \"shake tube\" which is a device used in turkey hunting to duplicate turkey calls.He stated in the time before the animal leaped from the tracks it was walking upright bipedally slightly stooped at the waist with arms swinging.  He stated the arms extended almost to the knees of the animal.When asked what he thought the animal was the witness was not able to say exactly what he thought it was, but clarified it was not a bear or any other animal he was familiar with at all.The witness also stated the experience unnerved him so, that  when his coworkers returned he had locked himself in the pick-up and was crouched in the floor of the vehicle.There were no other witnesses to this occurrence.  When asked about the friend's grandmother for possible correlation he stated she had passed away in the years since his sighting.  He stated he did know of some other people who had seen a creature like the one he described and he will attempt to contact them in an effort to convince them to come forward with their own accounts.",
