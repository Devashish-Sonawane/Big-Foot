Up ahead at a distance of around an 1/8 mile I saw something in the road that at first glance I made out to be a bear standing upright. I carry my mobile phone that has a camera. I grabbed it hoping to get a pic of a bear. As I approached, the \"bear\" walked upright to the side of the road. By the time I approached the spot where I had seen the object on the road it was just on the side and starting into the brush. It had just stepped off  the side of the gravel shoulder as I snapped the picture.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness in person.  He is indeed the U.S. Postal Carrier for the remote town of Quinault Lake.__________________________________Editor's Note (MM): The rainforest resort town Quinault Lake lay on the edge of the vast and mysterious Quinault Indian Reservation  (hereinafter \"QIR\").The areas around the perimeter of the QIR have among the highest quantity of credible sasquatch sightings on the North American continent. Unfortunately the BFRO's public database does not fully depict the amount of sightings from this area, because we will only post sightings that have been submitted in writing, online, by the witnesses themselves.  Many people in and around the QIR do not have computers or Internet access, so we are not able to publish their sightings.  We know about those cases because we met many of those witnesses in person during prior BFRO expeditions to this area. There have been three major BFRO expeditions in this general area, all of which resulted in several visual and auditory observations by expeditioners. Because of the amount of sightings just outside the QIR, many BFRO Investigators strongly suspect there is a healthy population of  sasquatches in the unpopulated interior of the QIR, which is generally inaccessible to non-tribal members.Most of the Quinault Indian Reservation is completely unpopulated by humans, because nearly all of the tribal members (fewer than 1,400 of them in all) live in three small villages on the perimeter of the reservation - Taholah, Amanda Park and Queets. There are no villages deep in the interior. The logging crews that work in the interior by day do not remain there after dark. Why would there be a high degree of sightings in this region?  Not many other places in North America have such a variety and abundance of large, natural protein sources. This lush green region has a tremendous population of elk, deer and salmon. Different species of salmon run up the rivers and creeks at different points during the year. End of Editor's Note (MM)______________________________Scott Taylor's notes (cont'd):There are additional details about the figure which are not in the witness\u0092 written report. The additional details helped me to conclude that this person did indeed see a sasquatch alongside the road. I was able to meet with the witness at a coffee shop in Ocean Shores.  I met both the witness and his wife. They are both very friendly and easy to talk with.  We talked for about an hour.  He was quite shaken up by the sighting.  He said the feeling comes back each time he drives past that particular location on his postal route.  As he rounded the corner of the road, heading east onto a \u00be mile long straight section of the North Shore Road, he saw the creature at the right side of the road about 200 yards away.  It was just standing there at first.The witness pulled his cell phone out, which has a camera. He held it out the window by the time he was 100 yards from it.  He said that he took the photo at a range of ~50 yards. The figure was standing in the ditch next to the stump, which he later measured at 6 feet high from the bottom of the ditch. The top of the head was 1 \u00bd to 2 feet taller than the stump.  As he pulled his vehicle up to the spot where the figure stepped down off the road and walked into the brush, he expected to able to see it moving away but it was no longer in view.He said the creature was very dark in color.  The sun was on the opposite side, so he could not make out details of the face or ears.     The hair was 3-4 inches long. He said the head was \"diamond shaped\", which I took to mean \u0093pointy on top\u0094. He confirmed this meaning. He could not determine gender. The walk was to him unusual, in that it walked like a \u0093big dumb guy\u0094. I asked him to give me a demonstration of how it stood and how it walked.  He demonstrated a slightly hunched over posture. He walked with large exaggerated shoulder and arm movements.  The stride was long.  He said it looked and moved somewhat like \u0093Patty\u0094 -- the figure in the Patterson footage.He also spoke of an incident that occurred while biking with his father on Mt. Si when he was a boy.  At that time one could ride a bike up there.  They were ascending up some switchbacks when suddenly his Dad stopped.  They both felt really uneasy, and so turned around and went back down.  He always wondered what it was that made them feel so frightened.The first photo, shows the stump in the ditch with the dark figure behind it.  The second photo shows the same stump without the dark figure behind it. This picture was taken a little closer to the stump.This sketch is by the witness.  Below, he describes the setting in more detail. As I said before I really didn't make out any facial features but this sketch should put size  and position in perspective. the stump is about 5 ft wide at the top and starts at about ft high by the road and is on a slope away from the road (sidehill) where the object was I would estamate about six feet making creature about 8 ft walking in the sketch downhill to the right into the brush, sort of glancing over its right shoulder as descended",

I saw from mid shoulder to top of its head. The color was a reddish brown but a bit darker on the head the hair was also shorter on the head then the shoulders, like a short hair dog, the shoulders were like wiry hair dogs kinda scraggy. Flatter face the head was really long almost like it was a cone or a peak at the top. I was frozen when I saw this creature I couldn't move for like 4 seconds, after that 4 seconds I turned to my friend to see if he also saw it, when I looked back the creature was gone. Sadly he did not see it. But he heard something moving through woods. There was also a very musky smell during this time.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "George and a friend were out scouting for good hunting locations not too far from Skibo. It was later in the day but there was still quite a bit of sunlight. They parked the car on the side of the road, got out, and started walking. George glanced over to his to his right and saw a very large, reddish brown torso, from the mid-shoulders up, and moving with them and about twenty yards deep in the timber. George froze mid-sentence. He watched the creature, by his recollection for four or five seconds, as it walked away. The head was large - \"...bigger than my head...\" was obviously cone-shaped - \"...not like ours, pointed...\" and the hair on the head was much shorter than what he saw on the body. It seemed to move with ease through the underbrush and woods with little effort. The head and torso barely bobbed up and down with each step as it would if it were a person. The footfalls were clearly audible, loud enough that his friend (who by now had walked well ahead of George) stopped and looked back. And both George and his friend smelled an overpowering, musky, wet-dog like smell which dissipated as the creature moved away. \"I knew it wasn't a bear. The head was elongated. And the fur on the body was more like long, scraggly dog hair.\" He and his friend shot each other an uncomfortable, \"what the heck?\" look, walked back to the car, and left.George is confident that what he saw wasn't a bear. \"I know what I saw. It wasn't like any wildlife I've ever seen before.\"",
