            "Observed": "I was delivering newspapers on a lightly snowing early morning in Novemeber of 2005. Id guess it was 4:30 or so, just before dawn. The roads were barely dampened. It was a very pretty almost wintry scene. The high Uintas range was behind me. I turned from highway 411 to highway 410, which takes one back into the town of Mountain View. There are no lightposts until you cross the bridge and drive maybe 1/4 or 1/8th mile. As I turned from hwy 411, I looked towards the first light, about a fourth mile away. It could have been 1/2 mile. There was something pretty big walking. It was walking toward me, and it looked like it was all one bulky thing- no coat or hat lines that I could see. It seemed to have its head pointed slightly downward. Not a lot, just a tad. It also seemed like its arms were slightly long. It didnt seem to be bothered by the cold or the light snow. It was just walking like it had somewhere it was going. It walked diagonally across the road, towards a clump of brushy trees. It seemed like it strode big, but not in a big hurry, but not a casual stroll, but it  crossed faster than a man. It walked on two legs but not exactly like a man...Ive seen moose, deer, elk, steers, skunks, foxes, one little bear, porcupines, you name it, but it wasnt any of these.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness a couple times going over the details of her report.  The following details can be added:She watched the biped for about 6 to 10 seconds as it crossed the road at an angle moving toward her from right to left passing under a streetlight then into the brush.  This is the first streetlight as you enter this rural town.The witness verified the distance of her sighting during the daily paper route she has taken for 5 years.  Using her odometer the distance was 3/10ths of a mile.  The biped crossed near a 45mph sign.  She later stood next to this sign to compare her height and that of the creature.  She thought the animal stood 7' tall or more.In addition to this sighting the witness spoke of other incidents from around the region.==========================================Editor's Note:The BFRO will be organizing an expedition to probe a particular hot spot in the Uintah Mountains of Utah in Summer (likely in mid-late June) of 2007.
