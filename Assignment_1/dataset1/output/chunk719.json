My wife and I shared a campsite and our friends shared a campsite, with 2 tents, on a second campsite about 50ft. away from us. I had drank no alcohol before going to bed so I slept fairly lightly.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On the evening of the 9th of September, 2008 D.N. called me and we went over his recent report in which the witness seemed credible and believable in his rendition. During this incident, the witness didn\u0092t want to wake his wife up, because she would have freaked out, and probably caused them to leave the area.I did ask a couple of questions that were not clarified in the report: First, did you smell anything out of the ordinary? \u0093No\u0094 Second, did you just hear the bipedal footsteps, and or did you also feel anything that came through the ground?  The witness just stated that he only heard the bipedal footsteps, and he never felt anything, probably because he and the wife were on an air mattress. Also asked if he had any strange feelings while this possible creature was in the area?  He did state; that he believed this thing stayed in the area for at least one hour, because of how the dogs in the camping area were acting, and how long the crickets were quiet. The witness did stay awake until the sun came up!The closest the footsteps got to his tent was about 40 to 50 yards away. Per DN, his friends had something similar happen to them one or two mornings later around 4 AM, same campground.This incident is consistent with other late night or early morning campground encounters with this creature. Also of note, besides the Lake Hemet incident; which is about 9 miles south of this campground, there was recently a sighting in a trailer park located on the south-eastern side of the Yucaipa area, which is about 25 miles as a crow flies and 30 miles thru the mountains.",
