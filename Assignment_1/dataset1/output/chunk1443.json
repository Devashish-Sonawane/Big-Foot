            "Observed": "Neighbors dogs started becoming increasingly loud/threatening barking...went outside of my home, heard at a distance of approx. 1/2 mile a series of howls...start low and quickly rise to a scream. Incredible lung capacity! Every 5 seconds or so it would repeat. It appoached from the river (got louder)...moved west...still howling...then quickly moved south/back from the river up the terain....howling as it retreated..untill it wasn't discernable.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Met the witness in person on Sunday, February 3rd, 2008. He relayed the same story with much more detail. His house is about 1/4 mile from Mountain Loop Highway \u0096 on the North side. Witness was first drawn outside by his own dog and neighbors dog barking. He went outside to his front porch -- which is approx 900 feet north from the Mountain Highway Loop, putting him about 1/2 a mile from the Stilaquamish River.His first impression was that a neighbor was sawing something with a crooked blade. But he quickly recognized the sound to not be mechanical, and that it was moving. The direction of the scream was to his left (East), and at first seemed to be moving toward his house. Each scream began very low - \u0093with a lot of bass\u0094 described the witness, and lasted about 3 to 5 seconds. It then would repeat about every 10 seconds. Witness was easily able to pinpoint its location, as it moved to his right (Westward) by the repetitious screams. He figures that the creature covered about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile in about 60 seconds time.Witness has lived and hunted in Colorado, and is familiar with the calls and sounds of wild animals. He could not fathom what made the screams and was bothered by it so much that he couldn\u0092t sleep well for the next few days. After describing the sound to a co-worker, he was told \u0093You probably heard a Bigfoot.\u0094 He found the BFRO.net and played the 1978 Snohomish scream - and was floored. That was it; except for hearing it in real life, he says the scream started out much lower in tone.As we walked the two lane road in front of his property, the witness estimates the creature must have come up from the river, and was traveling along Mountain Loop Highway - past his house, toward the direction of the Robe Valley Trail. From what he could tell, it must have cut back south toward the river - still screaming in 10 second intervals the entire way, until he couldn\u0092t hear it any longer. Total time of listening to it was approximately 5 minutes.The area has had much snowfall since, so a search for tracks was useless. Further contact will be done with neighbors via mail.",
