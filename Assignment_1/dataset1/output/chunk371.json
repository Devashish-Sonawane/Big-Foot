            "Follow-Up Report": "Several witnesses have described seeing sasquatches \"running\" briefly on all fours before standing erect and continuing on two legs. These observations usually involve young ones, but not always. Curiously, they most often happen in the context of a road crossing sighting. In this case the witness was on one of his usual trucking runs when he noticed the animal. He was going at a good clip of speed when he noticed it less than a quarter of a mile off. The figure was on all fours going across the road. He said its hair was all brown and parts of it had wave to it. The head was small and there was no visible tail. The animal also had a flat back.The bears in the area are small towards the coast and seldom seen within the Francis Marion National Forest. He found it unusual for an animal to be covered in so much hair for its size. It must have hung six to eight inches off its body. The arms were the same length as its legs. He thought if it were to stand up it would have cleared nine feet. It did not have a long muzzle or protruding ears. After he saw it he pulled his truck over to check the roadside. He felt uneasy and continued on his route. The route goes through the Francis Marion National Forest. It is low country, wet and boggy with heavy pine-cover. ",
