            "Observed.1  ": "I definitely believe they do exist. My interest began back in the early 1960\u0092s, when I was on a Girl Scout camping trip in the hills of Marin County. My parents came along, and my dad went off by himself hiking in the woods. He said he found a HUGE pile of human looking scat that looked too large to be from a human, so he thought it could be from a Bigfoot.  He didn\u0092t tell us about it until we got home, because he didn\u0092t want to frighten all the little Girl Scouts! I know that one night we were all awakened by some loud growling noises, which scared us, but it turned out it was just my dad snoring! I have read some reports of Bigfoot being seen in the hills of Marin back in the 60\u0092s, but I don\u0092t think he was a \u0093flower child!\u0094 I recently went to Bigfoot Discovery Day II held at the Bigfoot Discovery Museum in Felton, Ca. I got to meet all the famous \u0093Bigfooters\u0094 that have been featured on MonsterQuest and other TV programs about Bigfoot. Dr. Jeff Meldrum was there. He is the author of \u0093 Sasquatch:  Legend Meets Science.\u0094 Dr. Meldrum is a prominent researcher, an expert on footprints and is an Associate Professor of Anthropology and Anatomy at Idaho State University. He gave a lecture on the Yeren, which is the Chinese version of Bigfoot. He made the trek to China to research the subject, and it will be shown on MonsterQuest.  I also got to meet former San Jose police investigator, David Paulides of NABS (North American Bigfoot Search), who just released the book \u0093The Hoopa Project.\u0094  He spent several years on the Hoopa Indian Reservation in Northern California investigating Bigfoot sightings by the Native Americans that live there. He had a police sketch artist draw what they had seen, and you would not believe what these sketches looked like. They had VERY HUMAN looking faces!! It was shocking to see how human they appeared! When I told David Paulides about my father\u0092s discovery of the scat, he excitedly said, \u0093Come with me, I want to show you something.\u0094  So he led me to the back of his SUV, and he pulled out a gallon storage baggie that was filled with what he believed to be Bigfoot scat. It was very interesting and it did look human-like but much larger.   I also had the privilege of meeting Bob Gimlin of the famous Patterson-Gimlin Bigfoot film shot at Bluff Creek in 1967 He was a very nice man, but he was almost sorry that he had ever seen the female Bigfoot knick-named \u0093Patty,\u0094 because of the ridicule he had to endure afterwards. But he was treated like a real celebrity at our Bigfoot gathering. Kathy Moskowitz Strain and her husband Bob were there. She is the author of the book \u0093Giants, Cannibals and Monsters:  Bigfoot in Native Culture.\u0094 I saw her recently on an episode of MonsterQuest. Her husband, Bob, had a sighting of a 9 foot tall Bigfoot in 1975 while hunting in Idaho. I wouldn\u0092t want to run into THAT on a dark, stormy night!!! Or in the daylight, for that matter!!!  Bigfoot researchers Daniel Perez, Rick Noll, Cliff Barackman, James \u0093Bobo\u0094 Fay, and Bart Cutino were also in attendance. Craig Woolheater of the Texas Bigfoot Research Center came all the way from Dallas to be there.  He\u0092s been featured on several programs about Bigfoot on the Travel Channel. The curator of the museum, Mike Rugg and his wife Paula hosted the event. They had a barbeque with \u0093Bigfoot burgers\u0094 and hot dogs. Tom Yamarone entertained us with his Bigfoot songs played on his guitar. It was quite a thrill for me to get to talk to all the researchers that came to this Bigfoot convention. They had a great turnout for the event. It\u0092s amazing how many people are interested in Bigfoot. Some of the researchers stayed at the new Bigfoot Resort in Felton, which just opened for business. It\u0092s nestled in the woods by the San Lorenzo River, and if you stay there and you\u0092re lucky, you might hear a Bigfoot howling in the forest!!!  More and more very credible people are having sightings.  Even my own dentist saw one many years ago in the summer time while he was camping in a travel trailer with his wife. He said it looked to be about 7 feet tall and covered with hair and walked upright like a man. He said it was HUGE with very broad shoulders. They were parked at a rest stop somewhere in Northern California and they saw it walk by their trailer and cross the road. It scared them pretty good, so they left immediately. There are thousands of reports coming in from all over the world. If you would like to read some, go to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization website (bfro.net). They have a lot of very interesting Bigfoot reports, but let me warn you, these can be addicting! There have been several recent sightings here in California, but I don\u0092t think anyone has seen one lately in Pleasanton! (At least I hope not). There have been numerous sightings of Bigfoot crossing highway 101 north of Willits, CA, and many sightings by the side of the road. People have reported it crossing roads in 2 or 3 steps. WHERE\u0092S THE EVIDENCE??? Bigfoot has left behind plenty of evidence in the form of huge footprints showing dermal ridges, hairs that are from an unknown creature, scat, DNA evidence, and of course, all the sightings. Possible Bigfoot beds and shelters have been found in the woods, along with broken, twisted tree branches that are too high up for humans to reach. Horrible, ear-piercing howls have been heard that cannot be identified. Credible researchers, doctors and scientists are investigating this evidence, and no, Tom Biscardi is not one of them! These huge, hair covered hominids are known as Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Swamp Ape, Yeti, Hairy Man and numerous other names, too many to mention here. They are big and smelly and like to frighten campers by walking through their campsites in the middle of the night and raiding their coolers. They also let out terrifying screams that are extremely LOUD. So, the next time you are camping in the woods, lock up your cooler and sleep with one eye open, and listen for things that go \u0093bump in the night!\u0094",
