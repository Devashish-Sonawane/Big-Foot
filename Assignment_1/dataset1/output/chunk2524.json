            "Observed": "I was driving my car up a hill at about 60mph when up ahead at the top I saw what I thought was a man carrying a bundle of sticks (about eight feet tall overall) across the road. I reached the spot very quickly and was quite surprised to find nobody there. I actually slowed down to be cautious and decided that nobody could have moved away that quickly, especially someone carrying a heavy load of sticks. I am a person who likes answers and this has bothered me for seven years. It was when I found out about Bigfoot sightings in Ohio that I actually put the incident and Bigfoot together. I must admit that I never believed in Bigfoot, but taking into account all the hair samples and an endorsement by Jane Goodall I must say I think I saw one from a distance of about 200 feet. This is the only logical conclusion I can find.",

When he drove up to the area he expected to see a man carrying a bundle of sticks but to his amazement there was nobody there. The area where it crossed was extremely wooded on both sides of the road with large culverts on both sides. Whatever crossed the road had to jump over the culvert to get into the woods and out of sight.",

As I got breakfast ready, I sat down to watch the water boil when I heard a loud scream/howl sounding very much like the Columbiana County, Ohio recordings on this website. As soon as I heard this I ran down a hill from my campsite to the North bank of Salt Fork Lake. On my way down I heard another howl. Both were slightly shorter than the Columbiana recordings but still the same sound. I know that they came from the southern bank and I would guess that they were most probably a mile or so away. I only heard the sound twice. I was still a little shocked and didn't tell my father until a few hours after he got up. The howls didn't wake up any campers that I know of.",

The area in question has had a long history of Bigfoot sightings to the present day and the area he was camping at has had Bigfoot sightings within the campground. I examined the track cast of the alleged left foot. It was broken in one part, which made it hard to distinguish what it could be, although its shape was definitely foot-like in proportion. Looking at the photos, and seeing the distance between the alleged prints I can rule out Black bear and humans. If there was more detail in the cast and the photos more could be said. Credit must be given to the witness since he's only 14 years old and he took the time to photograph and cast the alleged track(s).  ",
