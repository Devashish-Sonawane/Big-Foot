It was after dark when we left and not being originally from the area, it was difficult to get my bearings. We were in the air around an hour before we landed and began our mission. All I know for sure location wise is that we were close to the Nisqually River and Mt. Rainier. The last night we were in the field, I was assigned to the LP/OP (listening post/observation post) in our defensive position's forward area.",
            "Other Witnesses": "No one else in my platoon ever mentioned anything unusual that night. Again, we were all tired and perhaps they were resting. At any rate, my unit was quite a ways to my rear, but I cannot help but think someone had to have heard that scream.",
