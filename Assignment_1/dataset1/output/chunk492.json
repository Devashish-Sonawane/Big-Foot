            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness by phone, and the following details can be added to the report.--The witness was in the area just hiking and looking around.--The road into the area is now blocked, so to get to the area you would need to walk approx. 11-12 miles in.--The creek was about 8-20 feet wide at that time of year, but not as full as it normally is.--When he spotted the bigfoot, it was squatted down by the creek, using at least one arm to grab fish out of the creek.--The witness saw the bigfoot grab one fish.--The witness watched the bigfoot for about 5-10 minutes.--When the witness moved, apparently the sound was heard.  The bigfoot suddenly stood up, and with three big running jump/leaps was out of view.--The bigfoot clearly ran away on two legs, but was slightly bent at the waist as he ran.--The witness did not see what happened to the fish so it could have been dropped or taken with the animal.--The bigfoot was dark brown with shaggy hair.--The witness did not go down to the area of the sighting because it was too steep to get to, so he did not see any prints.--The witness estimated the bigfoot to be about 300 yards from him.--The witness has not been back to the area since then, but related an earlier possible encounter in the same area from years before when he and his buddies believed they were being stalked by a bigfoot while camping.  They did not see the bigfoot at that time, only smelled him, and were driven out of the area by the harassment.",

            "Observed": "My son and I are fans of the show \"Finding Bigfoot\". He is 11 and I'm 43 years of age, he's a believer and I am not. It is an interesting topic but I'm a see it to believe it type of guy. We just got back from a 3 day Memorial Day weekend in Tonasket Washington. A friend has property there and invited us out. I thought for the fun of it I would take the boys (4 of them) ages 11, 13, 15 and 18 out to a dark and scary place to have fun and do some so called \"knocks\" and \"squatch\" calls... Well let me tell you my friends what ever it was either animals or what might ya... It is very active out there and the sounds scared the crap out of me...... We didn't see anything at all but we all heard many things loud and clear! I'm not easily scared I'm 6ft 6 inches and 255 lbs... And I was carrying my 9mm with me.. But this got my attention. Just thought I would drop a line on what we heard might interest you guys. We heard back on \"knocks\" , \"squatch\" calls (adult and young) and even heard a tree breaking.  This may be all animals but I'm no expert but I'm starting to believe...",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The reporting witness and his son traveled across the state with friends for a camping trip on their friend\u0092s 30 acre undeveloped property.  The neighbor there has 130 acres, with a small seasonal cabin, which wasn\u0092t occupied at the time.  The properties have old roads and trails, which the group uses for ATV (\u0093quad\u0094) recreational use.  The main road follows the valley floor and their camping area was up a private dirt road about 100 yards west of the road.  The terrain up the hill from the valley floor is forested and rocky in places, especially higher up.  From the top of the hill, the witness believed they could see all the way into Canada.  On the first night, the witness decided to take the group out to a remote area on their \u0093quads\u0094 for a little adventurous fun to imitate tactics from the \u0093Finding Bigfoot\u0094 show.  He wasn\u0092t expecting any response.  He tried a \u0093squatch\u0094 yell and thought he heard a faint distant response.  He then suggested that one of the boys try a yell.  That resulted in a two to three second high pitched vocalization response about 100 yards away, which they all clearly heard.  The reporting witness was sure it wasn\u0092t a human vocalization and, since it was high pitched, he believed it to be by a juvenile individual.  The witness then used an old four inch diameter branch as a bat to try tree knocks.  He tried knocks six or seven times, each time doing three loud knocks.  Three of those attempts resulted in a single knock response from different directions about the same distance away (100 yards), so they believe there were at least three individuals in the area.  On the second night, they rode their \u0093quads\u0094 up the hill, turned them off, and were planning to sit for a while to let things quiet down so they could listen.  Right away, before they tried any yells, they heard a deep one second grunt/growl about 80 to 100 yards out in front of them.  They then heard a very loud aggressive three to four second grunt/growl about 75 yards behind them.  The reporting witness felt the hair on his arms stand up and could see the fear in the eyes of the older boy in the group (the 18 year-old young man).  They scrambled out of there and decided try some things from near the campfire.  From the campfire, they heard the same \u0093juvenile\u0094 sounding response vocalization lasting one to two seconds.  They also heard the cracking sound of something breaking a good sized tree up the hill in the same general area they were earlier, about 200 to 300 yards away.  It was very loud.  They never did see anything, but they certainly had a memorable holiday adventure.    ",
