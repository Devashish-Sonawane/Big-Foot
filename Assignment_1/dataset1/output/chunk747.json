            "Observed": "Aug 2016, my wife (then just friend) and I were hiking along a creek in between Mt St Helens and Mt Adams. After the long day we decided to camp at spot that might have been used for a Skagit tower while logging. The tree line ran south and about 40 yards away from us. Sometime after it got dark and we were sitting outside talking when all of a sudden we heard multiple (around 3-4) wood knocks. We knew it was too much of a low hard sound to be a woodpecker. A minute or less later we heard from behind us two distinct knocks. This happened for a few more times.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.The actual date hearing the wood knocks was September 3, 2016. They only saw one vehicle of hunters earlier in the afternoon. Between ten to eleven o' clock at night they heard an exchange of wood knocks back and forth as the witness described. Four knocks in a row, then answered by two wood knocks from a different direction. This continued for about four minutes until he yelled. They did not hear any walking sounds nor detect any foul odor. Earlier, they had cooked meat for tacos. They returned to the area in 2017 and found the track along the creek (see pictures.) It was just one track and the witness thought the track maker may have been walking on the rocks but one step landed in the sand. The next step would have landed on rocks. He did not notice any claw marks. Investigator comment: This investigator was camped within six miles of this location in July 2016 and had a compelling Class B encounter.  ",
