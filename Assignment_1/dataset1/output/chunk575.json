            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness was interviewed on 09/16/2007 for approximately 30 minutes. He had not had any contact with the BFRO since his report, nearly 2 years previous. Nevertheless, his experience was recounted with significant accuracy with respect to that report. Additional information is included as follows:-They were hunting hogs with dogs. They were in a field that crossed into a swamp when they heard distinct, bipedal foot falls.- Thinking it was a game warden or the land owner, they began to move away from the area.-They noticed that whatever was following them virtually imitated their movements by the step, after they repeatedly stopped and listened. -The sounds were not just steps, but included the brushing by, or movement of palm fronds in front of the stalker. -The two witnesses became more alarmed, as the stalker mimicked their movements to the number of their steps. -Fearing they were being followed by the law, they bolted and ran about 100 yards and stopped.-Upon stopping, the witness reported their hearing very loud retreating sounds through the brush, including violent thrashing of brush, and snapping of branches and trees.-The witnesses deduced that it was not a person, due to the excessive thrashing noise, and he stated that \"It was BIG, whatever it was! No way was that a person\".-He also stated that the land owner or Game Warden would not have fled, but perused them.  -The witness stated that he and his partner were addled in no small measure, and talked of the experience for weeks. -Unfortunately, the witness and his hunting partner have since become estranged, and after no small effort, this investigator was unable to locate and contact the other witness.I had the opportunity to talk to the witness' wife about the incident, however, and she stated that she had a vivid recollection of that evening. She stated that upon their return from that night of hunting that they were both pretty shaken up over what had happened that night.Based on the information provided by these witnesses, it is my conjecture that they may very well have been stalked by a Bigfoot creature, as this is a very commonly reported behavior.",

We got into the jeep, and started spot-lighting the meadows. After hour of this, the loud howl went away. We re-treated to our camp, for some un-nerving sleep.
