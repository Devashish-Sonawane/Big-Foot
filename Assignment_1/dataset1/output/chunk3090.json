            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness several times on the phone. He is a very credible, well-known family business owner. The interesting thing about this report is that it wasn\u0092t until many years later he realized what his encounter was with. In 1970, both teenagers at the time in rural Virginia had never heard of bigfoot.During the end of his senior year in Loudoun Valley High School, the witness and his friend would occasionally joy ride on the train tracks. His friend\u0092s jeep tires fit perfectly on top the tracks.  One night while driving they saw a large, dark, hairy creature cross the tracks diagonally toward them, about 70 \u0096 100 yards ahead. The creature was very fast, crossing across the entire track area in 2 \u0096 3 steps. Area where teens witnessed the crossing:The boys, being in an open vehicle and not knowing what they just saw were very scared.  They stopped the vehicle and reversed as fast as they could to the next road crossing. The witness laughed as he described how the tires had fallen off the tracks in their haste, and how they bumped all the way back.In describing the animal\u0092s build he said it was lean and very athletic. The witness compared it to American Swimmer Michael Phelps' body. The bigfoot crossed the tracks left to right, coming from a wooded area heading towards a very large local farm. The farm grew corn and raised cows.He observed the following in the headlights.- It was 7 - 8 feet high.- It was a reddish brown \u0096 with some gray in color.- It had very long arms, long legs and broad shoulders.- It had no discernible neck.- It had a short forehead, and appeared \u0093ape like\u0094 in face.- The hair was thick \u0096 he could not see skin.- It did not seem to look at them.",
