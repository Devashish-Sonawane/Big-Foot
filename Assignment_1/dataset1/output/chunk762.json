The witness is a life long hunter and has lived and hunted this area all of his life.The area is dense mixed hardwood and pine forest which runs along a ridge line all the way north  to Lookout Mountain in TN. The area has abundant deer, wild hog, turkey, and small game. There is plenty of water sources year round as well as scattered caves throughout the area. Some areas are quite remote.After meeting the witness and hearing his story in person, it is entirely possible that he heard sasquatch activity. The area has a long history of sasquatch sightings.",
