            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed him on 7-5-06.  He guesstimated the creature as a little over 7 feet tall by comparing it with the height of the fence. It was powerfully built, had long arms, and thick, matted hair. Hair color was dark brown to gray or black. He said he was probably even closer to it than he originally stated. Possibly within 50 to 75 feet. It was running very fast and hard as it was trying to catch the deer. He did not get a look at it's face. It ran, leaning slightly forward with a great deal of arm swing. Jacob also noted that he was standing on a high patch of ground in full full view of the creature. Yet it never looked at him nor seemed to know he was there. As this occured very close to his home, I asked him about any missing pets or livestock. He says he has had some dogs turn up missing, along with an occasional goat. When the goats turn up missing he would search for them. On one such occasion he found the remains. He described it as having a broken hip, along with some internal organs, apparently ripped out.",
