            "Observed": "In Dec. 1978 I was duck hunting on Stockton Lake, Dade county 5 miles north of Greenfield, MO. At 630 a critter 200-300 yards to my right called a scream twice as loud as a man could call like AWWWWWWWW for 8-10 seconds followed by a OOOOO-o-o-o-o sound very melodic for at total of almost 20 seconds indicating a very big large lungs creature. Another one answered across the lake about 3/4 mile, exactly the same call. Another one about 3-5 miles beyond my launching point, three of them.  Then they all took turns and called for about 5-6 times in order as told to you. I did not know what they were. Told my wife upon returning from the hunt and my two sons. Some years later, I read John Green's book, \"Sasquatch, the Ape among Us\" page 394 where he described a bigfoot call and I'm sure 100% I was hearing three of them like described by John Green. I want to report this to Matt Moneymaker if possible or as a Class B incident. This incident and John Green's info makes me a firm believer in Bigfoot.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness by phone. He is a retired Air Force Officer and although this occurred in 1978, his memory of the event was very clear. While duck hunting he was in a canoe on the west end of Stockton Lake. He was placed about 1/2 mile east of the Sons Creek Bridge on Highway 39. He was facing west. It had started to get light but the sun was not up yet. He heard calls from three different directions. He described the calls as being made by something with tremendous lung capacity as the calls were very loud and of sustained duration. Some as long as 15 to 20 seconds. He stated it seemed as though they were trying to locate each other before daylight. Also, one seemed to be less loud as if it were a juvenile. The witness has researched Sasquatches since that time and read quite extensively on them. He has listened to the sound recordings on the BFRO website and stated the calls he heard resembled the 1978 Whoop-Howl from Snohomish County, Washington.The witness stated he has not returned to this location since then, but continued to hunt in different areas nearby. The area is densely wooded with scattered farms. I grew up in this area and was familiar with it before Stockton lake was built in the early 70's. The area is slightly more forested than at that time. I found this witness to be very credible and concise in his recollection.",

We observed a car parked off the road in the east side emergency lane.  The car in front of us pulled off abruptly and we wondered if there was an accident or animal that had been hit by a car.  We proceeded slowly around the vehicle when an \"ape-like\" creature approx 6 ft. tall sprang from the woods.  It crossed the road behind us and was nearly hit by another westbound car.  We were approximately 10 ft. from the creature which appeared to be standings somewhat erect, but when it ran it ran with its hands on the ground like a monkey or gorilla.  We are sure that the others in the vehicles on the side of the road observed the same creature.  We are surprised there are no recent reports from this sighting.",
