            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on the evening of February 16, 2010.The brown figure was off to the right side, parallel to the witness. Shortly after the glimpse of the figure the wood knocking started coming from the same direction as the possible sighting.The witness mentioned that he thought it might have been a Woodpecker until he listened to the \"Whoops and Knocks\" recordings from the Sierras in California. What the witness encountered was not a Woodpecker but rather a Sasquatch or a group of Sasquatch. This was confirmed as I had the witness listen to Pileated Woodpecker pecking and drumming and the witness said this was clearly not what he heard.The Pileated Woodpecker is one species of Woodpecker native to North America and large enough to possibly produce loud wood knocking; however the difference between Pileated drumming/pecking and Sasqautch wood knocking is quite clear when compared. Woodpeckers tend to have a sporadic rhythm and when drumming the sound is very fast like a jack hammer but not as loud. Woodpeckers do not eat wood, they peck searching for wood boring insects, which is a staple in their diet and hollow out dead tress for a nest site. Woodpeckers drum to claim a territory and attract a mate. To listen and view a Pileated Woodpecker, click the link below.Pileated WoodpeckerLike the Woodpecker, Sasquatch wood knocks are used as a form of communication, possible mating courtship activity and territorial claim. However in contrast Sasquatch wood knocks are very loud, definitive, and intense and can be heard over long distances. Sasquatch wood knocks generally have a set rhythm of one knock pause or several knocks pause and not as fast as Woodpecker drumming.
