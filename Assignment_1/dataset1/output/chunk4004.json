            "Observed": "It was in 1964 around August. I was at a family cabin with a friend of mine. I was born and raised in Salt Lake and when we were in junior high middle school one or the other of our parents would drive us out to our cabin in Cottonwood Canyon, Salt Lake County.  One or the other of our parents would drive us up to the family cabin and drop us off for the weekend or a few days and then the other parents would come pick us up.  I had spent a great deal of time in Big Cottonwood Canyon because of my grandparents' cabin.  I went deer hunting regularly with my father when I was younger and later on by myself.  So I thought I knew everything there was to know about that canyon.  We got dropped off, got settled in and being 14 or so there was no drugs, no alcohol no mind altering nothing  - at all, just good straight kids enjoying a little camping trip making us feeling grown-up.  Its hard to describe the feeling of utter isolation. In the summer time, mid week,it was not uncommon to not see a single car or truck for four days on that dirt road, no telephones of any kind. We used to go hiking, get up in the morning and decide which direction to go, up or down the road.  We decided we would go up the road and it was so hot and so dusty that you couldn't help but see there were a great number of deer tracks heading down the canyon. I mentioned it to my friend and he said there has always been a lot of deer, but I was like yeah but  its summer time and its hot and they normally go higher up in elevation where they got the creeks and they shouldn't be going down this low.  As we walked along, I looked down at a set of cat tracks and I said my god that's why they are heading down the canyon, we got a cougar on the prowl.  They got the deer moving down the canyon, their afraid of it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "We received the following voicemail from this witness:June 26, 2010 at 11 a.m.  \"My name is ****, and I live in Anaheim California, my phone number is ****, I am a Parkinson's disease victim and I cannot hardly type out a message on a keypad.  Is there any way to give a rather detailed, sighting information over the phone to someone? I would really appreciate it. It takes me a while to tell the whole story, but I think it's one of the good ones. This all took place outside of Salt Lake City in about 1964 in Big Cottonwood Canyon, my e-mail is ****. It would help me immensely if I could get this off my chest. Thank you. Bye.\"I returned his call and during a few telephone conversations we were able to work together to submit his report.  He talked and I typed.  I did not add anything.  I must say that reading his typed report does not have the same effect as listening to this gentleman tell his story. Unfortunately he has lost contact with his friend Dean. This was the only time anything strange had happened to him while at this cabin.The cabin, if it is still there, is no longer in the family.  This location is in the Wasatch National Forest, near the town of Alta and not too far from Brighton Ski Resort.  I asked for input from fellow investigator, Todd Strong from Utah and he had this to add: \"FYI that area is extremely rugged and wild, and even though it is close to Salt Lake City and a lot of people drive up and down the canyon, it is now off limits to hunting. It has lots and lots of big game, deer, elk and moose.  Also, it is not unusual to have a sighting there, there have been several sightings published on other sites and unpublished.  I think it has a lot of sightings just because of the amount of traffic up and down the canyon.\"  ",
