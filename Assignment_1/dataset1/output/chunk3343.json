            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is 42 and has spent lots of time in the backcountry fishing and mountain biking.\"We'd got to a point where the Eagle River moves to the north side of the highway. It was a long sloping bend to the right. As I was coming down, I looked to the river and saw the outline of two figures. My first thought was that someone had a wreck; someone had driven in the river. I started hitting my brakes, pulled over and put my blinkers on. I looked right back at the things while I was slowing down and the one closest to me, the shortest one, turned and looked at me. It looked like the taller one was hanging onto the other one's arm.\"When it took a step, I saw knees and elbows on this guy. The one closest to me stopped and it looked like the bigger one was trying to move on. It looked like it was holding on to other's arm, like it gave a little tug. I wasn't going more than 15 mph. They were about 30 feet away with a snowbank between us. I think the only reason I saw knees on the big one was that he was taking a step right then.\"These were furry upright creatures. I saw arms, legs and elbows. No snouts, no round ears, nothing like a bear. Nothing like a man really. If two men were in there, they'd be risking their lives. They'd last just a few minutes in that river.\"These guys didn't look as thick as the first two sightings. My first thought was a male and a smaller female. Then I got to thinking it was a juvenile and an adult. The one closest to me looked like my size - 5'11. The other one was easily a foot taller. They didn't have the huge head I saw in second sighting. Their shoulders were not as thick as either of the first two sightings.\"My first vision was elbows and a human silhouette, and fuzzy, with light coming from behind them. Right when I got next to them -- I'm not a prejudiced person -- it looked like a hairy black man looking at me.\"The nose didn't have a ridge on it like a human does. The impression I got was two nostril holes and lips. There was possibly skin showing on the cheekbones and around the nose. It looked not like a beard but fur on the face. The eyes were pretty big. I was looking right at this sucker, he or she was looking right at me and we both knew we were looking at each other.\"I pulled to a stop as close as I could to the bank, then got out and ran up the bank. By the time I stopped I had passed them. I had a camera in the car, and I figured there's fresh snow everywhere: they're not going to run in the road, and they're not going to run up that hill. There was so much snow being dumped, I thought man, this is the only way to move right now.\"I waited 4-5 minutes, but they never came into sight.\"I don't think their necks are as flexible as ours are, because when these creatures looked at me, they rotated their upper torso, the way you or I might do if we had a neck injury.",
