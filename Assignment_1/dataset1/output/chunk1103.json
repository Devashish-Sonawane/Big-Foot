He turned and looked at our car and then went off into the trees to his left. we both looked at each other and confirmed that we had just seen big foot! It was amazing.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with L.R. over the phone as she recounted her encounter. She and her friend A. were driving back from Leavenworth on a Sunny Sunday morning between 10 and 10:30. A's mother was in the back seat. After passing Coles Corner heading West on Hwy 2, they saw someone hiking toward them down a long straight stretch of the highway. As they got closer it appeared to be wearing what they thought was a \"hoodie\" as it had a pointed top on it's head. They thought it was strange that someone would be wearing a \"hoodie\" on a nice sunny day. Its arms were long and swinging while walking. As they got closer it looked like it was wearing a backpack but realized it was its head and shoulders and it wasn't wearing any clothes. Although it was a busy weekend (Oktoberfest in Leavenworth) there were no other cars on the road at the time.As they got closer they were able to make out other physical features. It had black hair and a \"bushy peak on its head.\" They could see the muscle structure and it was very lean and physically fit. As they got closer (about two city blocks away) it stopped and turned its head and looked at them. \"I saw it's face...it was lighter colored then his hair, but still dark.\" She described a protruding forehead, sunken eyes and a somewhat flat nose. It then slowly turned away and walked to it's into the woods. They slowed down and looked up the bank (approx. 15 feet high) where it had entered the woods. She said to her friend, \"now that is a bigfoot...yes we did just see that...\"A's mother was in the back, and not sure if she saw anything. Her friend A lives out of state and is willing to talk about their experience, I've given them my number and will update this report if I get a call back. ",
