We looked to our left and saw something walking accross the beaver dam. We do not believe it acknowledged our prescence. We would describe it as a tall, wide, black from head to toe creature walking upright on two legs trying to quickly get in to the woods. Also looked like as if he were carring a large object in one hand. It was time to go after that. The hunt was over.",
