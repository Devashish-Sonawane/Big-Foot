            "Formatted Address": "Highland Scenic Hwy, West Virginia, USA",
            "Observed": "My wife and I were taking an evening drive on Highland Scenic Highway 150, from US 219 near Slatyfork, WV, to the Cranberry Glades area on Tuesday evening 9/6/16.  We had been stopping at the scenic overlooks taking pictures, and had just left the Williams River overlook, and headed south on 150.  There was a stretch of highway that was very straight and a downslope of about 4-6% about 1-2 miles south of the Williams River overlook.  As we were driving down, we both noticed something in the weeds between the road edge and the bank leading up to the woods on the west side.  At first I thought it was a deer, with its head and neck stretched up above the weeds.  It was about 300-400 feet ahead, and while we continued towards it, it spun around, similar to an about face, but with the head dropping and a semi-crouch as it was turning.  It jumped up onto the bank, reaching for a branch to aid in pulling itself up.  By the time it jumped, we were within 80-100 feet of it.  By the time we got to where it had been standing, it was nowhere in sight, and we could hear no sounds of running or branches breaking in the piney woods along the road.  We both noticed that the weeds at this point and all along the area, were even with the hood on the 3/4 ton Chevy pickup we were in, making the estimate on the height of the creature at about 7-7 1/2 ft tall.  The creature was a mix of brown, and brown gold fur, longer than deer hair, but not as long as collie fur.  I have never discounted that Sasquatch could be real, but this firsthand experience has removed my doubt.  As we left the area, my arms and neck were covered in goose-flesh, and we were both speechless for about 10 minutes.",
