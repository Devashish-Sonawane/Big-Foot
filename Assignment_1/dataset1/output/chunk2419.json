            "Observed": "My brother Mark and I were riding in the back of my Dad's green '69 Ford pickup in the early summer of 1970 just outside of Georgetown, Arkansas.  My Dad was driving, my grandpa was in the passenger's seat, and my brother Larry was sitting between them.  Mark was 9 1/2 at the time and I had just turned 11.  As we made the right turn on the new highway from Georgtown to Draketown, I saw something 30 to 40 yards up the hill from the road.  At first, it was so tall that I thought it was the stump of a tree that had been struck by lighting, but as we passed it accelerating up the hill, it began to move.  In three steps, it was to the ditch at the side of the road, and then it took one long step across the ditch into the middle of the two lane highway.  It turned its whole body to look at us going up the hill.  Mark remembers a grayish splotch of fur on the chest, but otherwise, the fur was dark brown in color, longish but not dangling, and it had red eyes.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness on 1-23-05 whom I will refer to as J. J stated that he and his brother were riding in the back of his father\u0092s pickup truck with his father, older brother and grandfather sitting in the cab of the vehicle.  They were driving on an old dirt road and had slowed down to approximately 25 \u0096 30 mph to make a turn. J and his brother in the back of the pick-up with him noticed what looked to be an odd tall looking tree stump on the hillside about 30\u009640 yards away. As they watched, this \u0093tree stump\u0094 began walking towards the direction of their truck at which point he and his brother screamed. He said his father, grandfather, and older brother in the cab of the truck either didn\u0092t hear them or may have thought they were playing around and paid them no heed. The animal took several steps at which point it took one large step across a ditch adjacent to the road which the witness estimates to have been 6\u00968 feet wide. It took one more step and was standing in the middle of the road. The animal then stopped, turning its whole body to look at them as they were driving away and were beginning to drive over a hill. J stated both he and his brother got a good look at the animal and estimates it to have been approximately 20 yards away at its closest point as it descended the hill and stepped over the ditch. He estimates the whole sighting lasted  perhaps 20 seconds.  J described the animal as having dark, grayish like, coarse hair that was similar to the color of oak tree bark. There was more reddish hair on the front of the animal with a patch of whitish-gray on its chest. Hair was estimated to be 5\u00966\u0094 long. The face was described as flat with heavy a brow bridge somewhat similar to a gorilla\u0092s, yet not the same. The nose didn\u0092t look human and he never saw any ears.",

As we were traveling north on I-77 near the 150 milemarker (I looked after the incident!)...I noticed something up ahead on the right hillside. It was a fairly steep, snow-covered hillside. I thought I saw something that looked like a very big man walking on this steep hill. As I turned my head (we were traveling about 65 mph...so we went by quickly)...I could SWEAR I saw this very tall \"image\" walking from right to left across this mountain side, maybe 30 yards from our car! He(IT) appeared to be covered somewhat with snow, like you would imagine a mountainman who was out in the wilderness hunting would look. But this was 3:30 in the morning! I had a very uneasy feeling and a rather stupid feeling. I still can NOT believe what I'm pretty damn sure I saw! ...and that was EITHER a very tall man, wearing allot of winter gear with either a hooded coat or long hair and a beard that barely glanced in our direction as we drove by....or something else that I would rather not venture to guess upon!",
