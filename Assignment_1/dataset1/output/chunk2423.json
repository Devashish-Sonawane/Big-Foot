            "Observed": "Me my dad my cousin, my brother, and my uncle were Elk hunting by State line reservoir Utah.  My uncle and my cousin split up and the rest of us went one way.  It was getting dark we headed to a meadow to meet my cousin and uncle.  We are waiting for them so we sit down on a log.  My uncle and cousin are still a ways away.  Then in the back of my head felt like someone was watching me.  Then we here 2 very distinct wood on wood knocks in front of us.  Then we heard 2 behind us.  Then 2 more in front of us.  I got up and knocked back and in the distance we heard another bigger one.  We also a bit later heard a single knock even closer behind us.  I did some rock clacks and after a while I herd something move behind us.  On our way out my uncle herd one knock.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with a couple of the witnesses. The family group of hunters had split up beforehand but the witnesses are very certain that it was not those other family members playing pranks because they all heard some knocks after the group reunited. The knocks started occurring at dusk, roughly 6pm was there guess. There was no one else in the area. The group hiked in at least 1.5 miles from where they parked. The knocks were heavy and loud wood knocks. They were \u0093double knocks\u0094 (two in row) and were clearly responding to each other from two different directions. One direction was to the southwest of coordinates shown above. The other direction was to the southeast. It was difficult to determine the distance from witnesses but they estimate within 100 yards.The son had seen two cow elk in the area earlier but there were no elk visible in the meadow near which the group was waiting.",
