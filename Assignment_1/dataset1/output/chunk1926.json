The steps sounded as though they where 20 feet away and leaving the camp sight. I then looked up and noticed that my tent Zipper on the door was more than half way open. I Then Jumped out of the bed with my side arm and a spot light to look around. I did not see any thing or any one. And the foot steps stopped. I turned off my spot light and climbed into the tent and waited to hear the steps or see a flash light for it was too dark for human to see. NOTHING!! I could smell a slight smell of dirty feet and urine at the time.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness on 5/14/08 and there are a few details to add.Around 9pm that night a scream was heard followed soon after by coyotes sounding off and dogs at other camps barking. The scream lasted for what seemed like about 30 seconds but could have been less.  This exchange of an occasional scream and coyote calls lasted for about a couple hours.  The scream was described as like a train whistle and louder than the coyotes. They could hear the coyote calls from slightly different directions as the animals moved about in the distance, the scream came from that same direction as the coyotes. The next morning around 4am this witness was awakened by what was described as heavy footsteps close to their tent.  He listened for several seconds and noticed an odor.  The tent was open and the zipper damaged as though it was forced open.  He stirred for a few seconds while gathering his spotlight.  About 50 yards away in the direction the footsteps seemed to be heading the ground rolled down and away toward a canyon. There were other campers in the area with only one unattended camp nearby.",
