            "Follow-Up Report": "The sighting occurred at approximately 1AM on Hwy 199 roughly four miles past (if driving north) the turnoff for Patrick Creek Lodge.At this point along the highway it roughly follows the gorge of the Smith River. It is very possible that the Bigfoot was actually walking along the dark highway to save time and effort. It didn't get off the road before being spotted by the motorist.  At this time of night there are typically very few vehicles on the highway. Vehicles can usually be heard coming from quite a distance so it's possible to stay out of view most of the time if you're walking along the highway.I asked the witness to send me written responses to questions regarding how far away he was when he saw the Bigfoot. How far was he when he first saw it, and how far at the closest point.  Here is his response to those questions:\"The first sight I had I was about my guess 80 yards..., he was on the opposite side of the road heading against the traffic lane going in my direction.  I saw what I described in the report, I watched him..., about 3, 4 strides, arms swinging..., as I drove about maybe 20 mph right next to him.  I passed him at the closest I was was maybe 12 feet.  He never turned toward me, took notice or avoided me, like a lion on the Sahara, no care in the world, he was not startled or concerned. He was on the roadway and kept walking as I passed him.  His arms as I stated, looked long and lean, like a basketball player but, in reality were as Thick as my Thigh.  As I reflect, he had to be 800+ lbs and over 9' tall..., easy..., almost up to the Top of the Diamond shaped Roadway signs.My truck had alot of lights on it so, I know he saw me.  Immediately after passing him, I thought \"Turn around!, Turn around!!\" because I wanted to see his face and get a frontal view but, the 'S' turn was so close to him still and narrow,  I started talking myself out of it right away....  it was a bit too much despite the amazement. I wish now, I had not continued so far and then I determined to turn around about Little Jones Creek..., there I felt safe enough but, still talked myself out of turning around.I was still relatively new to the area and was not familiar with the Bar-O Ranch pretty close.I've traveled this many times now and am certain of the coordinates. [41.893958  -123.782815] Just past Idlewild and the Oregon side of the Ranch....Thank you again for the site, your assistance and your own knowledge and experiences which have made this known.Douglas Hickernell -----------------------------------------------------------------------------He also noted that he has heard other people mention sightings in this general area along Hwy 199.  This investigator has heard the same thing -- there have been other undocumented reports along Hwy 199 in the general vicinity of Patrick Creek and Monkey Creek.  I don't know the origin of the name \"Monkey Creek\" but it would be a good bet to assume the name is the consequence of Bigfoot sightings in that drainage over the years.Here's the entrance to the lodge at Patrick Creek.  It doesn't get more squatchy than this part of Nor Cal.",
