            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness and have the following to add to his report:- The witness and his friends found four separate sets of tracks in the area. Each set of tracks crossed the lakes they were on.- The snow depth varied from about six inches on the lake to about four feet in the woods.- Each track was approximately sixteen inches long, six inches wide at the ball, and three inches wide at the heel.- They could only clearly see toes in one track, but it was a double or even triple imprint. It appeared that there were five toes.- The heel to heel stride length was approximately six feet long.- One interesting note about these tracks is that the toes appear to fan outward, making the tracks appear to be curved toward the out-step.- The witness sent me the following photos of the tracks:I found the witness to be very honest and credible.(Update February 9, 2010) A reader familiar with the area sent us the following comment which should be considered in this case:Regarding the sighting report # 18221; I was born and raised on the Gunflint Trail of Minnesota, and my mother-in-law owns a resort on Poplar Lake. I thought it might be helpful to point out that the tracks found by the snowmobilers in the report look very much like moose tracks. The width and length of them can be explained by the possibility that the back feet of the moose stepped into its own front tracks as it walked. I don't know how to explain the appearance of toe prints except to guess that the tips of the cloven hooves could have been imprinted multiple times if the trail was used by two or more moose. Moose in this area are common, more so than most of the rest of the state. Moose wandering around the edges and across Poplar and Little Iron would leave tracks similar, if not almost identical, to the ones shown in the photos. ",
