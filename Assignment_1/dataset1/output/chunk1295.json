He\u0092s had significant difficulty dealing with the sighting over the years.This event so influenced his life that he later sought employment at a zoo, facilitating a more consistent observation of primates and to determine if the entire event could have simply been a misidentification. He was never able to arrive at any alternate conclusion.I found the witness to be well spoken and very matter-of-fact about the report. He remains and avid outdoorsman who actively hunts, hikes and backpacks.  ",
