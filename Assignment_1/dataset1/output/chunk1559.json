            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness via phone. She was driving northeast from Aurora, Mo. to Marionville Missouri, mid November 1997. Speed was about 50 MPH or less because of 2 lane country highway.  She saw the creature off to the left of the highway (2 lane) appx 150 ft. away. It was under a grove of trees and her initial impression was it was reaching up for a branch to climb up the tree, but it could have as easily been coming down. It's right arm had a hold of a branch and the arm was fully extended over its head. The right leg was also raised up in a climbing position. The creature was \"darker than the tree\" but she did not want to say it was black, but more of a very dark brown. The creature had much longer hair flowing off the back of its arm and leg than the rest of the body. Estimate of the body hair was a few inches long, but the hair on the backs of arm and leg were \"flowing\" so it would be in the 10-12 inch range. The creature had no neck and a conical head. Estimate of height would be in the 8 ft. range minimum. She is 5ft tall and she estimated she would have come up to its waist or stomach area. Next to the grove of trees was a cattle ranch, and she said \"this thing dwarfed the cattle\" and these were Charolais cattle, which are actually a good sized breed. It was muscular and firm. As she mentioned, when she saw it, she turned around and went back, because she really had no idea what she had just seen. When she got back to the site, it was gone. When she got home, she tried to draw it but the \"head just kept coming out wrong\".  She was trying to draw what she saw but \"her mind kept making the head round\" and it was not round. It \"came to a point\" and she agreed that conical was a perfect description. She did not have internet at the time, as she and her husband were truckers and did not have internet because they were always gone and had no use for it. Once the TV show came out she then realized exactly what she saw. No doubt in her mind whatsoever. She has moved several times since the sighting and has lost the drawing, but could draw it again today. The creature had its back to her the entire time so there is no facial description. She is retired, just turned 71. As she mentioned, she told a few folks and they scoffed at her, so she has kept it to herself until now. \"At 71, I have nothing to hide and nothing to lose, so if people don't believe me, tough\".  Her recollection of the event was clear as a bell, as if it happened yesterday. I have no reason to doubt her story.",
