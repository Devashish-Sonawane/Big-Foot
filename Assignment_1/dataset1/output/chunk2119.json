            "Observed": "The following is a report of unusual noises.  First, I would like to qualify myself as a competent woodsman...certainly no 19th century mountain man, but one who knows his way around the outdoors.  I was camping in the Rio Grande National Forest in Conejos County Colorado in September of 2005.  For those famaliar with this geographical area, I was in a district of the forest known locally and on topo maps as 'Jacob's Hill.'  I have hunted and camped in this area for many many years.  It was in late September and I was sitting in front of my campfire around 9 pm when I heard the most bone chilling and indescribable wailing roar that I have ever heard.  It was a very throaty sound and could best be described as an animal in agony.  While I have never heard a mountain lion roar in person I have heard this and other \"cat\" noises on T.V. and this did not sound at all like those noises.  The closest thing I could relate it to would be the noise of a hereford bull bellowing....but it was not that either.  The sound continued uninterrupted for about 5-10 seconds and then ceased.  Immediately coyotes from several different locales in the vicinity began howling and yelping as tho very disturbed.  I did not hear the noise again during that particular outing.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness is a very experienced lifelong hunter and outdoorsman and particularly familiar with this general area after growing up nearby. He was camping in the area to enjoy the fall colors and to scout conditions for his upcoming hunting trip. He had camped and hunted this area many times before and never heard anything of the sort at any time previously. His campsite was situated at the edge of a meadow clearing and a heavily wooded area. This location left him exposed and visible to the direction from which the sound originated. He had been camped there for one-and-a-half days at that point.The source of the sounds was approximately 400 yards away and was from within a stretch of timber between two large meadows. In attempting to demonstrate something like what he heard, he mimicked a long, loud, throaty roar and described it as a \"roaring yelling roar.\"Although long after the reported incidents, I visited the area the week after this report was filed and found it to be a perfectly reasonable and likely location for possible sasquatch presence. This general location, near the South San Juan Wilderness Area, has a long and varied history of reported sightings and unusual sound observations with occasional but regular reports continuing, including some of my own from recent years because of repeated field trips and studies in the vicinity. This report was the cause for my visiting a particular location that I had not examined previously. This is the eastern flank of the San Juan Mountains on the edge of the San Luis Valley and is, as reported, mostly drier, but abundant water sources are readily available nearby. Thriving deer and elk populations, along with free-range cattle, are present. David Petti",
