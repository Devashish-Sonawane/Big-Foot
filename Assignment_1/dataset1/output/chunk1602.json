            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness contacted this investigator the day after his report had been received by the BFRO, and before I had read it. He stated he had told a friend of mine about his experience, and the friend gave him my telephone number and suggested he contact me.  The friend is a law enforcement officer in a county that adjoins Cullman County.  The LEO has seen one of the animals similar to the one described by this witness. He, his father and brother have been aggressively intimidated by similar animals on their hunting land.  A few years ago he took an exceptionally good photograph of a large, man-like track left by an enigmatic primate on the property of a family member. I have had the pleasure of working closely with the friend in investigating his and other residents\u0092 reports from that area of Alabama. I spoke with the witness several times after his first call. As a result of those conversations a few more details can be added to his original report.\u0095 The first sounds that he heard before the figure came into view were yipping and barking which he thought were made by coyotes.\u0095 Those sounds were immediately followed by whooping, a loud yelling sound and loud bipedal footsteps.\u0095 He then saw a large, dark hair-covered figure \u0093walking hard\u0094 out of a draw to his left.\u0095 The figure was walking at an angle past him about seventy yards away when it turned left into thick brush to walk directly up slope toward the top of what is locally called Wilhite Mountain. \u0095 The witness stated the animal was in view for about two minutes.\u0095 He could hear the sounds of the animal\u0092s travel up the mountain for a minute or so.\u0095 The animal was \u0093dark\u0094 colored, about eight feet tall, taking long strides while leaning forward and with only moderate movement of its arms. \u0095 The animal\u0092s upper body was very wide and thick, with little tapering to the waist line, and the head appeared large.\u0095 Facial features were not noted.The witness is believed to be a credible observer and his encounter report valid. Residents of Cullman and Morgan Counties have generated many reports of enigmatic primates during the past several years. The writer has spent a lot of time in those areas documenting several of those reports.",
