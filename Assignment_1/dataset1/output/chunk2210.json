The witness could only see the top half of the animal not hidden by vegetation so was unable to describe its movement.He returned the next day with his uncle to look for evidence and footprints. It had been very dry in the area and nothing was found. They measured the area where the animal had been standing and estimated that it was at least seven feet tall.

It was in the middle of winter, I want to say late January/Early February. It was a decent day outside, and we decided to take a walk on the paths behind her house, which would take you down towards the Allegany River. We were about 1/2 the way down the trail, in a clearing that had woods on one side and a swamp on the other side. All of a sudden we both hear what we thought was an animal or something running through the woods, when (what we believe was a 'bigfoot') ran across the path we were walking on. It wasnt brown like we would have picture bigfoot being, it was more like grayish-white. It appeared to be around 6-7 feet tall. The only noise it made was a growling noise, it was different than a dogs growl. We were terrified and we ran, of course nobody believed us.",
