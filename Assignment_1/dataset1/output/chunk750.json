Around 2:00-3:00am one of the friends got up complaining about heartburn and decided to go out side tent and walk around to see if he could get any relief. Witness 2 started getting the campfire back going and a few minutes later all three of the witness's heard a loud high pitch whoop coming from just outside of light of campfire. Witness 2 got back into the tent at this point and all three stayed awake for sometime but did not hear anything more. Additional information was obtained from witness on other activity at the location but do to the sensitivity of the area I cannot go into detail.It is in my opinion from what the witness described to me that what he and the other two witness heard was a possible vocal (whoop) from a Bigfoot.I will be meeting the witness in near future to visit the location and conduct a more detail investigation of the area.",

I was driving from Houston Texas from a job interview, I had been driving all night long, and My Mom was with me because she decided to go, and we were almost home when it began raining. I'd say we had about 20 more miles to Meridian, somewhere between Enterprise and Meridian on Interstate 59..I was going about 55mph because of the rain. I noticed a large figure to the left of the Jeep running towards us. I looked at my Mom and asked her if she had seen what I seen, and she said yes. I asked her to describe what she had seen and she said that she had seen a large hairy man, or something running at us. We both came to the conclusion that it had to be a bigfoot. I hunt alot, and I have never seen anything like this in my life. I believe that what we witnessed that night was truly bigfoot... This creature looked to be about 8 ft tall... Scared the Hell out of us.I don't know what else it could have been if not a bigfoot.",
