            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was 43 years old at the time and was driving to work, she\u0092s a nurse at a nursing home. She typically drives 65 mph on this stretch of the road. She noticed something ahead in the middle of the road. She was concerned because she has hit many deer over the years. She saw a large upright animal ahead in the road in her headlights. She started slowing down and then got a better look as she got closer.   What she saw was at least 8 feet tall and erect on its hind legs. It had a coat that had a silverish hue to it. She only had a profile view of it but felt it had a dimension of 2 to 3 feet from the front of its chest to its back. She looked down at her speedometer for a moment and when she looked up it was on the side of the road. When she finally stopped her car she was within 20 feet of it and by the time it was going into the swamp. She wasn\u0092t able to provide any other details about its appearance.    She was certain it wasn\u0092t a bear because of its height, the bipedal gait, and the speed with which it moved wasn\u0092t typical of what a bear could do on its hind legs. There are a lot of bears in the area and she\u0092s very familiar with their appearance. She\u0092s also sure it wasn\u0092t a human because of its size.  She was more shocked at what she was seeing than being scared but she wasn\u0092t thinking about getting out of the car to see where it went.  She\u0092s sure about the height because her step father was 6\u00929\u0092\u0092. Her son is stocky and has a large chest but she said what she saw in the road was easily twice the size of her son.  The witness has lived in the area most of here life and she has had a couple of other experiences that she\u0092s never been able to explain. In 1982, 5 miles to the east of where she had the sighting, she went outside during the evening to take the dog off its leash. When she was outside something screamed so loud that she described it as \u0093something from the pits of hell\u0094. She was so startled and scared that she left the dog outside on the leash. She called her husband at work to come home and let the dog in. She couldn\u0092t tell from which direction the scream came from, she said it sounded like it was coming from everywhere.   In 1988, 7 miles to the east of the sighting, she was outside her home on Christmas morning and she saw foot prints in the freshly fallen snow. There wasn\u0092t a lot of snow but she was able to see that there were toes and features similar to a person walking bare footed in the snow. The foot prints where 13\u0092\u0092 long by 8\u0092\u0092 wide. She looked at a few prints and at the time chalked it up to some crazy person walking around in their bare feet.South of Rose City Road is Rifle River State Recreation Area which contains more than ten miles of streams and river, as well as 10 lakes and ponds. There is a wide variety of habitat types, including upland hardwood and pine forest, open grassland, lowland forest, cedar swamp, bog, marsh and open water. I did a little mountain biking in the area years ago and can verify that it has some very remote areas to it.",
