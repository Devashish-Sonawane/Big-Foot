I looked down to turned on my radio when I looked up  a huge black and brown creature ran across in front of my car about 60 ft in front of me. I slowed down to about 35mph  not sure what I had seen. I looked in the direction it ran and didn't see anything through the trees. I had my window cracked and smelled a skunk type smell. At that point I locked my car door rolled my window up and got out of there.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness about her experience in detail. I also visited the section of Highway 41 she described.The highway is two lanes northbound and two southbound with intermittent fields and wooded sections. There is a grass median also.Kate saw the creature when her headlights caught it crossing the two southbound lanes she was driving in, at 55 MPH. She slowed to 35, and watched it go across the median, then the Northbound lanes and into the woods. It was seen for several seconds, as it crossed the distance in front of her.Kate described the creature as 7' tall and over 600 lbs. The shoulders were \"as wide as a small car\".  She saw muscles bulge in the thighs as it moved.\"If I hit it'... my car would be totaled\" she said.The creature ran on two legs, upright, at a moderate pace, unconcerned with her. The gate and stride were very large. The arms moved from side to side. Kate heard no noise from the creature. She described it as being black and dark brown in color with matted hair. She rolled her window down and described skunk/fox smells. (Kate worked with rescued animals so knows this). She felt anxiety, and her heart pumping, and decided to get out of there. No other cars were on the road.State owned lands are located along the Lower Peshtigo River, south of Peshtigo, Wisconsin. It includes the Peshtigo Harbor State Wildlife Area, and the Bloch Oxbow State Natural Area.",

About 5 miles north of that is a small day use area with a small parking lot and restroom. I believe there are several trails leading out of there. We took the one to the north. It's very heavily forested in the area and doesn't seem to get much use although I cant't be sure.",

            "Time And Conditions": "In april of 1991 my exwife and I were on vacation headed to Crescent City, CA. The reason I remember the date is because I called my mom on that trip to wish her a happy birthday. Driving up the 101 we saw the ave of the giants scenic rout sign so not being in a hurry we took it headed north. Now I'm not sure ot the exact location but between two small towns maybe five miles north of where this gift shop that is actually carved out of a living redwood tree is (I hope that helps) there is a small parking lot off to the right where you can park and walk along some trails that I believe run parallel to the highway. I think the area is intended for day use only. well, we stopped and took a walk down this trail just to take in some of the scenery when about 200 yards down the trail my wife began to get this feeling something was off to the right. I told her it was her imagination when all of a sudden from that direction came this yell or howl that made my skin crawl. It!! started what seemed to be a good distance off in the thick forest and then moved rapidly closer. What startled me was the speed at which the source of the sound traveled. The howl itself sounded halfway between a human voice yelling \"Ahhhhhh\" and the high pitched sound of an elk. It wasn't an elk or human or bear as near as I can tell though and what ever it was moved very fast. We didn't see anything though but we got the distinct feeling weren't welcome in the area. As it seemed to get to what seemed to be around 75 yards away we ran back to the car and promptly left. We never could figure it out so we just dropped the subject. My ex is a superstitious sort and at first started trying to explain it away as a ghost which me want to drop the subject even quicker. But the issue has always unsettled me and when I heard some of the recordings of bigfoot screams on this or some other b.f. website, one in particular was exactly like what I heard that day. I still don't know what it was of !! or sure but I'll never forget it",
