When he and his friend shined the light on the animal they briefly saw its face, noticed eye features, the nose being broad and flat. He also recalled that unlike most descriptions of sasquatches in reports, this one's shoulders were not as wide as one would think, given its height. But the arms were longer than usual human proportions. When the two then teens were retreating from the woods, the animal followed them for most of the hike back home. This witness stated that there were some older folks in the area that would often warn he and his friends that they might run into something big and hairy, he did not take them seriously. I told this witness that if he ever wanted to meet at this area and face his fear, I would go with him into the woods and hopefully help him overcome a traumatic childhood memory. He accepted the offer, on one condition; it would have to be in the daytime. ",
