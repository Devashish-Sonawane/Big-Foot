She lives with me though, and can be reached at the info i will leave later. The occurance happen several years ago in a rural locaion close to our home. My mom was on her way home from a friends house that lives only a short drive from our home. It was late afternoon and she was coming around a curve in the road, when a tall (6-7) ft tall hairy biped slowly crossed the road in front of her car, almost causing her to wreck. She said it looked like a bear on two legs walking, with the face of a gorilla. The animal walked directly in front of the car without seeming to get in any hurry, even though she had to slam on the breaks to keep from hitting it. She said it only looked back at her once and never stoped walking.It then disappeared into the woods by a lake.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness does not recall the exact time and date that the sighting occurred, but there was still plenty of daylight, and headlights were not needed. The witness stated that the creature stepped out from the tree line to her right on to the road approximately 5' from her vehicle. The witness had to break hard and swerve to the right to avoid colliding with the creature, bringing her vehicle to a stop. The creature proceeded across the road to the left, almost parallel to the vehicle. The witness noted that the creature's hair was dark brown (almost black) in color, about 7 1/2' tall, and approximately 400 + lbs. It did not hesitate or look towards the vehicle until it was almost in the other tree line, and at that time the witness got a very good look at the creature's features and build. The sighting lasted a total of approximately 30 seconds. The witness is a retired medical professional. ",

From inside the house we heard what we thought was barking constantly.  We own several dogs so we were used to it.  this continued for about an hour or two then quieted down.  Later on that evening about 2am or so we heard the most bloodcurdling sound ever.  The only way i can describe it is like about 20 dogs all screaming and yaulping at once in a shrill chorused scream.  We haven't heard it again but it came from across the farmer's field in the woods across from The speedway.  I'd have to say the date was around January 10th or so.  We have heard other things too and seen plenty of deer...but never heading across the field.  We don't know what it was and did not see it at all.  We have seen shadows move down the dirt road we live on but figured it was just someone walking up the road. Maybe we're just paranoid...but i've lived in the woods here a long time and never heard anything like that before.",
