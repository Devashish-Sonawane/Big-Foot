            "Observed": "Last year in October around 6 pm. I was sitting at a stop sign at a T in the road. I looked to my left and saw something come out of the woods. As I watched this thing, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I felt immediate terror. I was too shocked and scared to even pick up my cell phone and take a picture of it. I watched it walk across the road to the other side of the woods. It was not a bear as it walked on 2 legs. It was not a human as I looked for shoes, hands, facial features. It was black and hairy with long arms. It has taken me so long to say anything to anyone as I never knew where to report it to. Plus I didn't want people to think I was crazy. It never looked at me  But just stared straight ahead. I told my husband about it and he didn't know what to think. I wanted to go check for footprints however I'm disabled and walking in the woods would be hard plus I was terrified as well.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking to the witness for over 30 minutes I found her to be credible and extremely forthright about her sighting that day. She was traveling north on 62nd Ave and came to a stop at a T in the road. The cross road was 212th. As she turned her head to the left to search for oncoming traffic she saw a dark, hairy figure cross 212th Ave. The creature was extremely tall and had long flowing hair coming from its arms. The witness describes her husband as being 6'4\" tall and this creature was easily a foot to two feet taller than her husband. The creature was walking with a slight lean to the front and did not turn its head to look at her and she thinks that the creature did not even notice she was there. The incident occurred about a half hour before dark. She said she did not have her headlights on yet. She did not remember how many steps it took to cross the two lane road.The witness estimated the distance to be 4 to 5 car lengths away from her. She is familiar with what a bear looks like and was positive that it was not a bear or someone in a costume. She described the legs as being thick like tree trunks. It was very muscular and the back of its head was flat. Since the creature did not turn its head at any time during the sighting she did not see the face at all. She was very scared and sat at the stop sign for a few minutes wondering what she saw. She did not tell anyone except her husband for a long time after her experience.The sighting happened in a thickly forested area with many houses interspersed together with open areas. This creature crossed between two houses about a 1/4 of a mile apart. The houses each had large open areas and the creature walked in the direction of the most thickly wooded cover available. This leads me to believe that the creature was familiar with the area and knew exactly where to walk and maintain the best cover.The sighting area is located close to Northwest Trek which is an exotic animal park. The witness also claims to see many deer in that area throughout the year. It is also dead center between Hwy. 7 and Hwy. 161 which each run North/South.Based on the location area being heavily wooded and full of deer. I have come to the conclusion that it is able to sustain a population of one or more Bigfoot.",
