            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness via telephone and during the interview she articulated an account that was compelling as well as detailed. She confided in me that she is a doctoral candidate in neuroscience for a prestigious New England university, and has always prided herself in her capacity to be \"firmly grounded in reality,\" but that this incident has shaken up her view of nature in general. She went on to tell me about her trip to Oregon and how she grew up in the region and loved hiking in the area near the coast. During a hike in the late afternoon she and her fianc\u00e9e began to hear what she said sounded like \"good sized trees being broken at ground level.\" She described this sound as incredibly loud in the relatively serene surroundings of the hiking trail. She said that her initial feeling was that the sound was created by a bear, and began to urge her partner to start heading back to the trailhead as it was getting close to dusk, there was a light drizzle, and the air was starting to get a chill. She said that all the while she felt uncomfortable, as if \"someone were watching her.\" She also stated that there was a smell of \"sour coffee grounds\" or \"rotten garbage\" in the air.As they headed down the trail she noticed that wildlife sounds in the area all at once became silent. This was particularly curious to her as well as her fianc\u00e9e, so they hastened their pace in a steep part of the trail only to hear more very loud \"breaking trees\" again thinking they were in the presence of a bear.At this point she caught movement out of the corner of her right eye and looked around where she saw from a distance of about 25 feet a very large figure, obscured from the chest down peering over a tree branch at her. She gaped in disbelief for about 3 seconds and grabbed her partner's hand. By the time she turned to look again, the figure was gone. Her fianc\u00e9e was seemingly unaware and later reported that he did not see the subject.While the glimpse was relatively quick, she said it felt like \"moments\" because of the unusual nature of the eight-foot figure. She described the face as that of a \"person\" but \"twice as big\" with a long, reddish-brown receding hairline and light brown, human-like facial skin. She said that the nose was proportionally long compared to the rest of the face, and rounded with wide nostrils.  The large, dark eyes were greenish in color, with no whites visible, just irises.She said that the subject's very muscular (\"bulging\") right shoulder connected to its head at the jawbone, with no real sense of neck at all, and that the chest was \"as wide as a person is tall.\" She described the most fascinating aspect of the incident was the complexity of the subject's expression. She detected genuine curiosity emanating from the figure's face as if it could not help but reveal itself to her because of that curiosity.As the couple rapidly descended to the trailhead they discussed what they had just heard and what she had seen, and neither had any tangible explanation. The witness went on to express how this event had changed her assessment of wildlife and the outdoors and instilled a new fear of hiking and camping.I found this witness to be extremely credible. Her discussion of the event came from a scientific vantage point, and she expressed curiosity regarding why this particular subject had singled her out, and the meaning of the apparent behavior.",

Upon arrival at the lake, immediately we observed rocks being thrown into the lake. There were three of us who witnessed it, my wife and young son had gone up another trail however and they were not present. My photo subject and I had gone to the lower area to try and get a few shots, but the rock throwing continued. Also observed was tree knocking and limb breaking by the creature at this time and after we had gone back to where we originally heard it. We were across the lake from it, and at that time I had decided to take a quick succession of pictures to try and find what was throwing the rocks at us. At this point in time, all of us decided to leave the area. Since I had my wife and young son with me, I didn't want to run the risk of them getting hurt. It was when I got home that I realized that I had actually gotten  two images of the creature. I also believe that I have another of it observing me when I was taking the picture of the boy in front of the lake, but it is not as clear as the other two. To me in the photos its face resembled an orangutan, only it was completely black. Also of interest is that the creature appears to have something white in its hand.",
