            "Observed": "It was fall.  About 9 at night. Just getting dark.  A friend and I were camping on Mica Peak in Spokane County WA.  We decided to go for a quick hike just before dark.  We were walking an old logging road.  As we came around a right hand bend, we saw the outline of a man standing next to a small pine tree. The tree was only about 12 feet or so tall and Christmas tree shaped, but fairly sparse branches.  The \"man\" was standing to our right of the tree.  It was around 30 yards from us.  At this point it was getting too dark to make out much detail of the thing, but it was about 4 feet shorter than the tree, dark and wide.  The tree wasn't moving, but the \"man\" was swaying slowly from side to side.  We backed up slowly till we were around the corner out of sight before we turned and got back to camp as fast as we could to start a fire.  We were camped near a creek in a valley.  That night after sitting by the fire talking and playing guitars we went to bed.  While laying in the tent just about asleep, from back up near the logging road we had hiked, we heard screaching.  The only thing comparable I've ever heard were chimpanzees on tv. There were 5 or 6 screaching sounds in about 10 minutes and that was it. We laid in the tent holding our pistols most of the night, but didn't hear anything else.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and his friend were grouse hunting along a logging road just before dark when they both saw the \u0093man\u0094 slowly swaying side to side by the pine tree.  The witness described the hair color as moose brown, not black, and believed the \u0093man\u0094 was a Bigfoot.  It was getting too dark to see other details, such as eye color or any features, but they could see the arms and legs.  Having a lot of outdoor experience, he compared the swaying to that of a deer moving its head side to side to get a better look at you.  Later that night, while in his tent, the witness and his friend heard the \u0093screeching\u0094 sounds.  He knew it wasn\u0092t a cougar\u0092s scream, but could only describe it as that of chimpanzees.  He attempted to find vocalizations that matched his experience, but can only match them to chimpanzees. They were camped about a quarter of a mile below where they had their sighting and didn\u0092t hear anything else before or after that. ",
