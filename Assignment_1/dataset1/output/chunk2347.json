            "Follow-Up Report": "He's a credible witness, and he recently served as an MP in the military. The following notes are from an interview over the phone.  When the figure apparently heard the kids coming along the opposite edge of the ball field, it suddenly spun around and crouched down, wrapping its arms around its legs, turning its back partially towards the road. He said it looked like a large stump in that position. It stayed in that position until the children had left the area. After the kids had passed, it rose up quickly, spun back around and continued in the same direction, but now at a faster pace. He described it as not running but moving very quickly, taking long steps, swinging its arms very wide as it walked into the treeline.  He described its arms as being very defined and muscular in the moonlight. It had a human-like form overall, but its hands came to a position just above its knees. Its head appeared to have a conical shape to it, with what looked to be some matted hair on the back of its head. The hair seemed long on it's forearms, legs and back and it seemed to flow backwards when it  moved but he could not tell its color except that it seemed dark in the partial moonlight.  ",
