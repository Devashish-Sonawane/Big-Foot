The bottom of the ravine was thickly covered with brush and trees. Down in the ravine we all clearly heard what sounded like a person or a large animal moving at a walking pace downstream (opposite direction of us.) It sounded like someone moving through thick brush and occasionally breaking branches, not even trying to be quiet. Later, my guide told me she thought it was a bear, since she had experience with them in this area before. To this day I have no reason to think otherwise.",

While running accross a talus field in a remote area of the western Clark range, I came across pits in the talus where granite blocks had been lifted up and stacked in neat piles about 3 or 4 feet high.  The rocks were angular, about 2 to 3 feet long, and the biggest of them may have weighed a couple hundred pounds.  The resulting pits in the talus were maybe 5 feet deep.  There was one big pit of that size and 1 or 2 less distinct ones perhaps half as deep.  The area was at least a couple of miles from any trail, or any prominent location that anyone would go to, like a lake or a climbing area.  As I recall, I was basicly running in a straight line, more or less, from the Clark Range to the Mist Trail region.",
