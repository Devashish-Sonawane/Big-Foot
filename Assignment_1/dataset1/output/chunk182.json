Later I showed my wife and we found additional prints leading from the road out in front of the house to the back of the property. I made a cast on one of the prints that was in some pea gravel. I took it down to the park ranger and she said she didn\u0092t know what it was but it wasn\u0092t a bear or any other animal from around the area.\u0094The cast print is 14'' long and 9\" wide.The animal was walking, lumbering, up the hillside and was bipedal. It looked over its shoulder at them while they were watching.The witness also related that about a year ago his dog was barking at the woods and heard something. He stated he went outside to see what it was going on and saw a large dark object in the trees in the light from his flashlight swaying back and forth. He further stated that there was an intense smell of rotten meat in the air.On another occasion, howls were heard from the back woods and lasted for about 5 min. The howls were very high pitched. Almost like screams. Not a cat or bear.",
