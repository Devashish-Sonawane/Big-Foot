It was cold but no snow yet.  We went outside on the porch and could still hear this piercing wail.  It stopped and started again as we tried to tell where it was coming from.  Across from the old house was some rock bluffs about 80 yards up the hill.  The sound seemed to come from atop these bluffs.  The cry started at a lower key and rose up in pitch and intensity and lasted at least a couple of minutes.  We got scared and went back in for the night and locked all the doors.",

When I laid the paddle against the side of the canoe I startled approximately six whitetails which promptly blew at me and took off.  The next thing I did was set up a fishing pole supported by a small stick and then set up camp.  Next, thinking the pole hit the ground I walked over wih my mini-maglight and noticed that the pole had not fallen as ti had sounded like.  I heard some leaves/sticks crack up the big bank (approx. 20 feet above my head), shined there and saw two big eyes staring back at me.  The color was beautiful pale yellow and",
