            "Observed": "In June, 1980, a friend and I were fishing in an ox-bow type lake adjacent to the Mississippi River in Crittenden County, Arkansas, near the town of Hughes, off highway 147. This is just across the river from Memphis, Tennessee, and the area was experiencing was the hottest summer on record at the time.  It is heavily forested, running basically north and south along the river for many miles, and connecting with other river basins emptying into the Mississippi.  My friends' family owned the land surrounding the lake, and theirs' was the only inhabited structure for at least a few miles in any direction.  A small section of one end of the lake had a beach and was used by swimmers and picnicers during the day.  The more distant areas were used only by occasional fisherman.",

            "Follow-Up Report": " I spoke with the witness by phone. He is currently a practicing surgeon. He describes the creature's hair as dark brown, almost black, and perhaps four to five centimeters long. \"It was clearly hairy\". He had no real view of the hands or feet. The creatures eyes he remembers as \"proportional to the face\", not overly large or small. The mouth he remembers as \"more or less like a human's.\" He did not have any specific recollection of the appearance of the nose. The second witness is now deceased.",

I heard the howl and had no idea what kind of animal made that noise. Another camper a few hundred feet away had dogs that starting going crazy barking. The howling went on for about 20 minutes to a half hour. Our German shepherd started growling. We got up and got in the car with our sleeping bags still thinking it was a bear. At about 5 am and still dark, the other camper left in a hurry in his pickup. It looked like he lit about a half gallon of Coleman fuel in his fire pit. The flames were probably 6 feet tall. We did not see or hear anything else that night. The next day I walked around and looked for signs of the animal. I walked around the other camp and did not see anything. We joked about bigfoot coming that night but I was shocked this last year when I was listening to some of the bigfoot recordings on this site and then heard the moan howl from Columbiana, OH. That was exactly what we heard and it gave me chills.",
