            "Observed": "Heard what I thought was music and low voices coming from low hills on each side of creek. One low voice or sound on one side, then another on the opposide side of creek. I was cooking diiner with my small optimus stove and had camp set. Sound was so strange that picked up camp and hiked down the the moonlit trail. (All the time I felt I was hearing limps and sticks break above me on ridge line. I was in the middle of my thru hike of the Pacific Crest Trail and had been outhiking since April 2nd. I have never heard these sounds in all my hiking or hunting days past or present. In the morning, I stopped at a side creek to fill my water bottles. I walked above the trail for a deeper pool to dip bottles in and found where something had crossed and slid vegation going down and then up. Next to creek was a large footprint in small sand bar. The other prints were not as clea, but I wish I would have taken there pics as well. I haven't told many folks about the sounds or print till the last few years. Good luck with your research. I feel that at least in 1977, Bigfoot was still alive and well. (I believe there were two comunicating across the creek. Tracks were found in Eagle Creek Bench area which has since suffered a few good burns.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness in person.  The witness stated that \"there was a whole bunch of tracks where something had slid down into and climbed up otherside. Just one track that looked perfect. (Being 19, I wasn't bright enough to take a pic of slide marks down and up creek). Didn't think anyone would believe me anyway and didn't even bring out track pic again for 20 years after getting 'razzed' fromshowing it after the hike.\"The witness stated that he was able to take a photo of his foot against the larger print by himself: \"I focused my heavy old Ricoh 35 mm. on track, ( 64 slide film) then just held camera out at arms length and clicked. This was a hit and miss as photo was second of two taken. Other pic was off a bit and blurred.\"",
