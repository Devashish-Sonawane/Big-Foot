            "Follow-Up Report": "Upon a phone conversation with this gentleman I can add the following observations. He and his wife were driving along a narrow two lane road when a small deer ran across the road in front of them. Upon slowing to avoid a collision with this and any possible following deer, he and his wife both noticed a bipedal figure running in the opposite direction. He stated that they only saw it for a brief period of time, approximately six seconds, but they were sure it was no deer, bear or any other familiar animal. The terrain was covered with a lot of fallen trees and would have easily twisted or broken an ankle of any human covering this ground at such a great speed. The animal was also running up hill so he knew it could not be human with this agility and speed. The animal had broad shoulders and a bulky torso comparable to a large football player. The color was between black and a grey and he likened it to a deer's fall color, but definitely not a deer! They observed it from approximately fifty to seventy-five yards away but they only saw it from behind. The height was between six to six and one-half feet. The gentleman stated that he did believe in such a creature but his wife was completely skeptical, until that moment, those six seconds totally changed her perspective.",
