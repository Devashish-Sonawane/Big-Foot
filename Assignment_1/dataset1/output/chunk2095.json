            "Follow-Up Report": "Upon further investigation, the witness added the following:Question:You said the incident occurred over 25 years ago, and that you found our site a few years back.  Why have you waited until now to submit your report? Response:  I actually submitted it a few years ago, and hadn't heard from anyone.  It was at a time when the website was going through some changes (about 2 generations ago), so I assumed my report took a back seat.  I just waited until now to resubmit it.  Also, I was waiting to see if anyone else had submitted a report for the same area or county or surrounding counties. I had told my kids about the \"encounter\" and always made great pains not to embellish the story, and to leave the decision of what I saw up to the imagination of the listener.  I did make it a point to not mention what I thought it was.  I always said, \"I don't know what exactly it was I saw, but I can tell you what happened.  You decide.\"Question:'Best guess' - how much time elapsed from the beginning to end of your encounter? Response: Maybe 15-20 seconds, possibly up to a minute if you include driving over the rise, noticing the dead animal, to seeing the subject run into the woods. Question:What made you classify the creature hiding in the bushes as ' a little old black man'?  I.e. what facial features did you see?  Did it look humanoid, and if so, what characteristics made it appear human?Response:As I was passing by, I only saw the subject out of the corner of my eye, and did not get a head-on look at it.  Please remember that my focus was on avoiding hitting the road kill, and that my eyes were definitely diverted away from the road in front of me for a split second. It was in this split second that this figure caught my attention, enough to look back in my rear view mirror.  As I passed it, I did not catch any facial features, only that it had a dark complexion (not Caucasian).I thought it was a bit odd, and in that split second, wondered why someone would be just inside the edge of the woods as most of us would be just OUTSIDE the edge of the woods if we were waiting to get a peek at something in the road.This is what raised my curiosity to look in the rear view mirror to see if anything had changed and to see if the subject had approached the animal.  I was given the distinct, split second impression that he/it was hiding at the edge of the woods, waiting for me to go by.  I cannot explain what gave me that impression.Question:Please estimate the creature's height in feet, approximate weight, shape of head.Response:  As I had no frame of reference in my rear view mirror, I can not give you any estimate as to the exact size.  However, I remember having the distinct impression that what I was looking at in my rear view mirror was not what I thought I saw out of the corner of my eye a few moments earlier.I do remember thinking that this subject was bigger than I had instinctively thought.  And what really did catch my attention was the size of its gait.  The impression I had out of the corner of my eye was that, whatever or whomever it was was in a squatting position.  I would say that I had the impression that it was bigger than I was at the time (I was 6'3\" and about 225 then). Honestly, I am having trouble remembering the shape of the head.  I think it was about the same shape as a human, but the dreadlocks, or ears (whatever it was) really set what I saw apart from what I was expecting to see.Also, as the road was taking a slight bend to the left, up a slight incline, I was not concentrating on the figure but on the road again, and all I was able to make out was more of a silhouette at this point. Question:You said the creature resembled a monkey while standing in the street.  Would you classify this animal then as more ape-like than human?Response:What I meant by ape-like was that it briefly stood, hunched over the road kill, with its fingertips cupped, extending slightly below the knees, in a stance unlike us normal humans.  The knees were bent slightly.Please remember that what I saw at this point was more like a silhouette. The lighting, combined with the vibrating rear view mirror did not allow me to get a good look at any distinct features. Question: When the animal looked in the direction of the oncoming car, did it turn just its head or entire upper torso?Response:  It turned its head then its torso as it ran off.  It must have been looking down at the road kill, and must have seen the lights of the oncoming car out of the corner of its eye.  The car obviously got its full attention away from the road kill.  By the way, it really was not dark or dusk enough to have lights on.  But for some reason, that particular driver had them on.Question: Estimate the distance in feet for each stride.Response:It would have had to been 4-6 feet per stride in order to get back into the woods with 3-4 strides.  I have the lasting impression that its stride was not by \"stretching\" or extending it normal \"let's get out of here\" gait, but was rather natural and effortless/smooth/normal.Again, I remember thinking or wondering how in the world whatever I saw could only have taken such few steps to get back to the edge of the woods.  It was this thought that shook me up, then thinking I had just seen something very unusual.  It was at this time I remember being mentally shaken, and my wife (then girlfriend) telling me that I looked like I had just seen a ghost. Question:If you can think of any more information, please don't hesitate to add it.  Even very minor details you might think are irrelevant may afford valuable data to our scientists.Response: The only thing that was noticeable was the swamp like stench that permeated the area.  It reminded me like the times, as a kid, when we would get stuck in the muck at the edge of a creek, and the smell of the muck was definitely distinctive on our shoes/sneakers.  I do not remember the smell lingering after I had passed the area in question.Even now, I still can not legitimately say I saw a Bigfootanimal/whatever.  I can only report on what I saw.  I know enough not to draw conclusions based on a viewing through a shaky rear view mirror in a car moving away from the subject.  Again, I just wanted to at least give a report of a \"POSSIBLE\" sighting.  I am making no claims as to the exact identity of the subject.For all I know, it could have been a big black guy, wearing a hairy aviator cap (dreadlocks weren't in vogue then), who could run at a fast pace with huge strides, and who didn't have the best posture in the world.  In addition, perhaps this report may draw out others who could give you a more definitive experience.I just hope I'm not wasting your time.  But the experience hasstayed with me through the years.  I just started retelling the story as my son had been in scouts and made for a good campfire story.  But please remember that I took great pains not to embellish the experience.",

            "Observed": "Apr 20, 2003- A friend and I were carrying in supplies on foot to a bear bait site about 2 miles west of hwy 89. This area is restricted to foot or horseback only and is on the Idaho/Wyoming border. I had carried in the bait barrel and some bait items a week earlier, having noted some bear tracks in the snow along the creek the first week of April. We walked along the foottrail early morning and about a mile in came upon the fresh carcass of a muskrat right on the trail, which was about 30 feet up from the creek and along the bend of the mountain. We were both startled by the dead muskrat because it was just there with no evidence of a predator in sight. I suggested that it may have been dropped by an eagle, but honestly there had been no sightings of eagles on our walk. Another mile in and we began placing our bait in the barrel, having noted that the bait already there had not been disturbed by anything. We were preparing to leave the site when we heard the cracking of branches and looking in the direction of the noise,we watched a large piece of a tree tumbling down the mountainside towards us. About 400yds up on a ledge stood something bipedal, the color of a moose, leaning against the remains of a tree. I asked my friend \"What is that?\" He replied \"must be a moose\". And I answered \"but it only has 2 feet!\" He did not reply, but started walking back to the trail. I looked back at the animal which was 7-8ft tall as best as I could estimate, very broad at the shoulders with legs that appeared long and thin compared to the rest of its body. It was hard to make out the shape of its head, as I couldn't see a neck and its head appeared to be bent, looking down the mountain towards us. It then quickly moved behind the broken tree and into the treeline . I wished I'd had my binoculars that day, but in our haste to get on the trail that morning, I accidently left them in the truck. My feeling while returning along the trail to the truck was almost of myself being stalked, a strange \"role reversal\". My friend moved quickly down the trail, no words spoken about what was on that hillside. When I recounted the experience a couple months later to friends, I had forgotten the part about the dead muskrat, which my friend quickly interjected to them as a very disturbing incident to him. Yet he laughed when I told them we may have seen a Bigfoot, which he readily dismissed.",
