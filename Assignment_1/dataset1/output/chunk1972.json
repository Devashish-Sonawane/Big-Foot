            "Observed": "The BF I saw was honey brown in color and I witnessed it bang large rocks together. I didn't see its face, its hair was in the way. It was standing sideways. This happened on a farm south of Rock Falls, Illinois. November-2006. It happened in a cornfield, with a large pine grove, along with brush and some trees. This particular part of the farm was in an area where they dumped their cows and calves, that had died while giving birth.  (its illegal but many do it because it cost a lot of money to dispose) they also dumped the carcasses of the deer from hunting, after they butchered them.  I didn't smell the BF, but I'm pretty sure my German Shepard did.  I was out there to walk her, like many times I had done in the past.  But this time she took off. I tried to call her back, but she had a funny/scared look in her face.  I thought that was strange, but blew it off, and kept walking on a little bit more. That was until I looked up and saw it. I looked at my friend, to say \"hey did you see that\", but he was looking down at the field/ ground. I looked back, and it was gone. I was in shock, trying to rationalize what I had just seen. I was thinking what was a man doing in a Chewbacca suit out here!  Then I realized it was a Bigfoot.  I was too embarrassed to say anything and kept to myself.  I got scared then and asked that we turn around.",
