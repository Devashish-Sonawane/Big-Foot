            "Observed": "While squirrel hunting on Bayou Bodcaw on a clear and sunny morning, I heard dogs running what I thought was a deer on the west side of the creek. I was standing on the east side appx. 20 ft from the bank looking for squirrel in cypress den trees. The creek was about 30 to 40 yards wide with banks 10 to 12 ft high. As the dogs drew closer I put a 12 ga 00 buckshot in my shotgun. I then saw what I thought was a person break through some bursh and slide down the bank almost to the water. It then crawled back up the bank and turned and looked my way. This creature had reddish brown hair all over its body about the length of a deer's hair. It stood appx. 6 to 6.5 feet tall. Due to its hair I could only make out its nose and eyes features. After a few seconds it turned north and jogged up the creek until it was out of sight. The next day I told my dad about this. He asked why I didn't shoot it.  I told him it looked too much like a man.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness is a 53-year-old male and is a Major with the Louisiana Department of Corrections. He was watching the entire episode down the barrel of his shotgun and was prepared to shoot if the creature started to head his way. During the interview he stated that he saw the creature very clearly and offered some additional observations. Not only did he see its nose and eyes, but also its ears. Its face was incredibly human-like. Its hair was of uniform length, coarse and looked just like  deer hair. It was entirely covered in hair. Genitalia were not exposed. Its body was proportioned just like a human and not huge   and muscular like he has seen them portrayed on television. Witness quite possibly observed a juvenile sasquatch. ",

            "Observed": "I live in Tazewell VA. Last Friday on June 20, 2014 me and my son was cutting hay on my dad's farm in Thompson Valley near Route 16. It was close to 3pm and the sun was mostly out. I was cutting hay way ahead of my son, the field is half surrounded by woods and near the Clinch Mountains. I had made a pass by the corner of the field on a hill side and my mowing cutter is heavy so it slid down the hill while cutting, and left a strip of grass about 60 foot long before I seen it. So I raised the cutter and turned my head to back up and re-cut and out of the corner of my eye something caught my attention. I turned my head a little more and I saw something real dark or black and tall and slim with long legs running on an angle away and down the hill real fast . Now the beast was not on our side of the property and the slim patch of woods where I seen it was only about 4 ft. wide. The sun was bright so I saw it for the 3 to 5 seconds real fine! Below where it ran and beside one the upper ends of the property are thicker woods! At first it did not dawn on me what I just had seen because we were trying to get the hay cut before it got too late. But as I was going on and thought about why was a man there and ran off when I stopped the tractor to back up! Then it dawned on me it was to tall and it was blackish in color, and the 3 steps I plainly saw it make was the distance between 3 fence post. We put our fence post around 10 feet apart so that would make it about 25 to 30 feet in length in 3 STEPS! I then knew what I saw was human shape but too big for a human and if it was someone I would have saw colors for the pant and shirt, there was no colors just dark. I forgot to mention the bigfoot I saw was around 100 yards away so the first time I passed it not seeing it, and when I stopped to back up with the tractor It must have thought I saw it and that's when it ran off I guess? I stopped to tell my 17 year-old son what I saw, he is 6ft 2 and slender. He crossed the fence where I saw it and stood there till I walked to the place I had seen it and I knew it was much taller than him! We found no hair or foot prints just cow and horse. And one horse hair. I am a christian man.  would not lie and tell this occurrence of my life if it was not so. That image is burnt in my mind till the day I die! I would have to say it was around 7 foot tall! And fast!",

After making his third or fourth pass around the field with the tractor, something happened to his cutting attachment that caused him to look back behind him. At this time, he noticed the figure moving from the corner of the field and into the thin patch of woods along the edge of the field.  The encounter only lasted for 2-3 seconds, but he was only 100-150 yards away from the subject. His son came over shortly after so they could compare his son's size to what he saw. His son is 6' 2\" tall and this thing was much larger than that. Its head was much closer to the tree limbs than his son's head. Most of this immediate area is open fields. The figure was heading towards the mountains. This entire southwestern VA area is a real hotspot for bigfoot sightings. ",
