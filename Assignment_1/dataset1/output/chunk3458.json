            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.He is unsure of the date but said, \"I can still see it in my mind.\" He observed it for one to one and one half minutes, and saw it travel about 100 yards. He was archery hunting for deer and elk and this is a popular area for hunters. He hunted Mt. Emily for three to four years. The day of this sighting, his wife was driving and at first glance he thought he saw a hunter in a ghillie suit or camouflage sitting at the base of a tree 200 feet away. It was not in bushes. As they drove past, the dark brown figure stood up. They stopped and he got out the door to watch the figure walk down and across the road fifty to seventy five yards behind their vehicle. The witness remembers it was massive with a huge round head and shoulders three or more feet wide. He saw the arms swing, arms that went to the knees. The hair was long enough to be flowing as it took long strides. He does recall facial features but did not see ears or long nose.The figure stopped for thirty seconds to look at them and then went out of sight down a steep hill. It was so steep the witness said he would not have wanted to descend it. The figure had stopped by a tree and its head was as high as this eight foot tall tree. I asked the witness if he remembers a wildlife trail near to where the figure was sitting. He does not know, but there are large game animals in this area. He did not detect any odor. I find him credible.  ",
