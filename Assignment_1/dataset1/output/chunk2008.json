            "Follow-Up Report": "I conducted a somewhat lengthy telephone interview with the witness.  She is quite credible.  She has a clear recollection of the sighting and added some interesting details not included in the initial report.All three witnesses saw a large, black figure moving rapidly on two legs down the side of the ravine toward the lake.  The witness noted the figure's arms were \"swinging as far as its strides.\"  She described the path it was using as well-worn, \"like where a log had been skidded.\"It was the rhythmic thumping, which the witness later determined to be the sound of the creature's feet hitting the ground, and the shaking of the trees and bushes, that drew the attention of the witnesses to the break in the foliage where they briefly saw the figure.In recalling the events, the witness noted that the increasing incidence of rocks and sticks hitting the building at the cavern entrance (which she referred to as \"unit 4\") took place during the weeks before the sighting, but only when she was alone.  At that time, she was the only female guide on the staff.She also reported frequently experiencing a feeling of \"being watched\" while there, and occasionally experiencing unexplained fear.  This was particularly noticeable at the end of the day, after she had finished her last tour and had to lock up the entrance and exit of the cave by herself.  She also reported noticing a strong \"smell of death\", similar to, but not quite the same as, a decaying animal corpse, coming down off the mountain on occasion as well.The witness noted that she was raised in the mountains of Northern California, that she is not afraid to be alone in the woods, and that these sensations of fear were unusual for her. Further clarification on investigation:This investigator is quite familiar with the location of the sighting, having been to the caverns as a tourist.  Not only was the witness' description of relevant details consistent with my own observations and knowledge of the site, but during the course of the interview it became quite clear she knew the place very well.It also may be significant to note, as the witness did in her initial report, that there is no access road to the site from the land side.  It is very isolated, located about halfway up the face of a rather rugged mountain.  Tours leave from the visitor's center and cross the McCloud arm of Lake Shasta on a small ferry to a dock on the East shore. From the lake shore, a bus takes you up a series of hairpin turns on a steep, one lane road to the unit 4 building at the cavern entrance.I also questioned the witness concerning the apparent inconsistency in the original report concerning the weather on the day of the sighting.  She is quite sure that the weather was cloudy, and that the reference to the \"warm, sunny day\" was a mistake, although some of the other incidents she mentioned did occur on sunny days.  In a subsequent phone call, she gave the BFRO permission to correct this inconsistency in her original report.Further investigation, including the effort to locate the additional witnesses, remains ongoing.",
