            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness recently. He was pleasant and eager to talk about what he and his friends found. As stated they were driving on Logging roads East of Humptulips enjoying the afternoon when our witness saw impressions along side of the road. Curious he stepped out and saw a track line of about six to seven impressions. They were large in size and this piqued his curiosity. He also noted that the stride length was larger than what it would be for a normal sized person.  The track line appeared to head off up the hill side. He was able to put his hands inside the impressions and discovered five toes.He noted something interesting. The toes were not visible from the top of the impression, they were inside. He got the notion that whatever made these impressions was walking Toe/Heel not Heel/Toe. The other interesting observation the toes were pointed straight down in a digging fashion. Apparently this creature was digging in with its toes, as it walked up the slight incline. His friend then went further up the road and above the witness and found more prints. This track line was longer and had more than thirty impressions. I asked if they could determineanything from the tracks. What was it doing? Were there other animal tracks? Was it following something else? They did not note anything of importance. It just came up the ridge and into the tree line from the landing area. It wasn\u0092t until they both saw the stride length that they determined these tracks were not made by a person. Again they were able to determine five toes. He put his boot next to one of the tracks and took a picture. I have included it below for scale. In our conversation I asked him if he could measure his boot. He did and I was able to determine the size of the impression. Give or take a little, it is approximately 17\u0094 long, 8\u0094 wide at the ball, and 4-5/8\u0094 at the heel. This is not an exact science due to the fact that the Impression was made in snow. It does appear that the track was exposed to the sun and there is some evidence of melting. The snow fall had happened within the last forty-eight hours. Our witness did take a picture showing him attempting to create the same stride length. He could not quite make the same stride. He told me that he is 6\u00922\u0094 tall. I asked him if he could recreate the same stride length and measure from heel of back foot to heel of front foot. He did and said that measurement was 54\u0094. According to the picture he sent me the stride is slightly longer than that. One last curious notation, in one of the pictures he sent me it looks like something urinated. There is a dark orange hole in the snow. Much darker than what would be normal for a person.Our witness has had three other curious encounters those are documented -- Report #1131.    Below is a photograph showing a hi-lighted foot impression with the witness known boot size showing scaleBelow is the orginal photo.",
