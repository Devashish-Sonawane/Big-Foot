            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness by phone.Despite 40 years passing since the incident took place, the witness seemed to recall the details with relative ease. He was driving around with three friends in the vicinity of central New Jersey's Allaire State Park. Immediately before the driver began to turn - they heard a high-pitched scream, which - accoding to the witness - was directed at them. With the car pointed directly at the side of the road as the driver performed the k-turn, the headlights caught a \"big, reddish-brown\" creature approximately 7-feet tall. The witness estimated that the animal was within three feet of the front of the car. The animal reacted \"like a deer in the headlights\", as if it were caught by surprise. The witness is confident in his ability to recognize both black and brown bears (had been stationed in Alaska for military service). He was confident that the animal that they witnessed was not a bear.He stated that it was very hot that evening. They had the windows down and noticed a \" musty smell\". When they saw the animal, the driver froze. His friend reached over and honked the horn. The animal had no immediate reaction. This part of Southern Monmouth County was mostly farmland and lush woods up until rapid development began in the 80's and 90's. The northern-most part of the New Jersey Pine Barrens begins a short distance from this area to the south. The Pine Barrens is an immense wilderness of pine forest and swamp that runs from central to southern New Jersey. Allaire State Park has over 3,000 acres of mixed forest and fields. A branch of the Manasquan River runs through the park. The Manasquan supports many species of fish and wildlife.",
