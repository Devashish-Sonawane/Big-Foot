There was enough light to just make out that whatever it was, was moving on two legs. We found where it had gouged out the soft earth on the stream it crossed. No discernible footprints, but whatever made the gouge was big. We had to WAG (wild-ass-guess) at the length, over 19 inches. It was longer than the tip of my extended fingers to my elbow. The grass going across the meadow didn't allow for footprints but was pressed down several hours later. We didn't follow the trail towards the trees!!",
