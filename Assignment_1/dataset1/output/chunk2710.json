            "Observed": "I was Pheasant hunting and was coming home before dark and I was just past the Pilot Rock cemetery that is in the country. I was on a little ridge that takes me home to the house. I did not see anything for I can see all the way to the highway from there.Then I looked over to my left and there was \"someone\" walking towards the mountains and here it was getting late. It was about a 1/4 mile from me. It was a dark figure that looked like a guy walking but its arms were longer than normal for a person. I hollered at it and it turned and looked at me, when it turned it moved its whole top half of its body! I hollered HEY again and it didn't look at me. I watched it for about 15 min. till it was out of sight from me. I was not scared for I was well \"armed\" with the shotgun. The funny thing was that first I did not see it, then there it was. I think it was laying down hiding and then it jumped up and started walking away. I can't tell how tall it was for there was nothing to compare it to out there, but it did walk fast and was out of sight a mile away in 15min. And I never thought to look for any tracks.",
