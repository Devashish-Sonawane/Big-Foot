            "Also Noticed": "This I think is also unusual. I dont recall if this is same trip or not(we go several times a year)but on this occasion we went on a canoe trip, there were 5 adults and 5 kids. We pulled off river and climbed a steep embankment to heed mother natures call. The adults were standing around talking when we heard the very loud noise. It is very hard to describe it but it sounded like a mix between a loud squawk of a parrot mixed with kind of a bobcat growl. It echoed along the river and lasted about 3-5 sec.everyone looked at each other and said what the hell was that? I've never heard anything like it. My husband said it was probably a cat (like bobcat) and  two other guys said it didnt sound like any cat they've ever heard. We brought up that it might be a mountain lion since not long before that there was a report that there was one in the area and it supposedly peeled the skin back on a horses face.(horsefarm located right next to cabin,scary thought).  Since reading these reports I had asked husband(since he is an avid hunter and done plenty of it up there) if he's ever heard,smelled or seen anything strange in woods. He said he has smelled horrible smell on several occasions but thought nothing of it since was raised being taught that bear smelled bad and he has heard strange noises like screech owls or something. It seems that once when we were out  riding around in truck (we do that often to see deer,possoms,bear,coyotes,any wildlife that we happen upon) we went to a very remote lake,with no houses or anything around,you have to drive two-tracks to get to it. well I cant recall for sure but I remember seeing bare foot prints in muck and I thought \"who would walk barefoot in this stuff?\" Did not think it was bigfoot but who knows? I will pay much more attention now!",

I would know exact location if I go back. I have a stillshot of it in my brain. I think that is Oscoda county but cant say positive without a map.",
