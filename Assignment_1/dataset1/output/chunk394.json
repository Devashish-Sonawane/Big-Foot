I had my binoculars to look for loons when we heard what sounded like a large tree branch or a large animal stepping on a downed tree across the lake from where we were sitting,  approximately 450 feet. I was excited because I thought I was finally going to see a bear. Next there was a loud splash in the water that sounded like a very large animal or something large being thrown in the water.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness was credible. This is an area conducive to supporting a large animal, with plenty of lakes, rivers, deer, berries and other food sources, with lots of secluded areas.The three wood knocks were about 45 seconds apart, and were supported by the preceding tree break sound, the loud noise in the water and also the dog's spooked behavior, which was a hunting dog (a retriever).From beginning to end these events played out over a period of about 20 minutes, per witness.Sometimes, knocks can be human in origin, such as a hammer or pounding. These knocks were not frequent enough to be a human working. In addition, this is uninhabited state land.Interestingly, the witnesses later tried to simulate the knocking sound from the same perceived position. The knocks were inaudible, indicating that it takes quite a wallop to carry that distance, something these humans were unable to duplicate.",
