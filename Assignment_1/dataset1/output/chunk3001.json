            "Follow-Up Report": "A correction by Hector regarding the date of the sighting was given to me as Summer (mid-July) of 1995, rather than 1996. The time of the sighting was anywhere from 11pm to 1am.The weather was clear, dry, and the evenings were cool enough up in the mountains to need a jacket. Sighting occurred in Otero County, NM. The area is wooded (although thinly within the campground itself), and the grounds were nestled between two hills in a more flat area at the bottom. Mountains and hills surround the area, and are heavily wooded with pine trees, etc.No bigfoot creature was seen by Hector, and he said his friend Edgar did not see it either, they only heard it screaming. They were awakened from within their tent in the night by a screaming in the distance that sounded like a cross between a woman and a baby. Hector stated that the sounds continued, with pauses in between, from very far in the distance, until they came closer, and into the campground. He (they) could tell that the creature was not human, nor did it sound like any animal they had ever heard before. The creature, they thought, was walking through the campground checking out the four spots or so where campers were at, and possibly foraging for food. The creature got to their camp and stood near the fire pit, or between the fire pit and their tent. Total distance was estimated to be at approximately 20 to 25 feet away from the tent.  The creature continued to scream and pause, grunting and sounding like it was sniffing in the pauses. Then it would scream LOUD again and it started to walk off into the forest. The witnesses dared not poke their heads out of the tent.  The only weapon they had was a hammer.  Estimated time from the first screams they heard until the last screams they heard were approximately 10-15 minutes. Hector and Edgar got up the next morning and looked for tracks, but none were found. Weather Conditions: Chilly, due to higher altitude during the Summer.  A sound similar to what Edgar says he heard can be found here. Edgar chose that particular sound after listening to several alleged Bigfoot sounds on several websites.   A  cougar cry sounds like this. A female cougar in heat sounds like this. A cougar snarl sounds like this. ",
