(as he mentions above).Once back inside the home, he heard, through an open window, the sound of the animal walking off back the way it came. I drove through the neighborhood on 12/08/06. I saw the backyard and it is a heavily wooded hillside. Twain Harte is a community in the Sierra Nevada mountains and is surrounded by the Stanislaus National Forest.
