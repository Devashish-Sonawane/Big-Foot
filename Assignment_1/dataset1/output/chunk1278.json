            "Follow-Up Report": "Update on 11/16/99:After speaking with the witness by phone, I am convinced that he and his son experienced something that defies immediate explanation. As he stated in his report, they were hunting just off of the southern slope of Mt. St. Helens. It was approximately 4 PM. NOTE: I should add that this location is only about 2 miles NE of the infamous Ape Cave, and 4 miles SW of Lava Canyon (See Database: Skamania County, WA, June, 1998). The witness seemed very credible. He also called to talk to me at his expense for over half an hour. He has told this story to very few people, and decided to report it to us after having seen us on the news (KATU Portland). He is also very interested in becoming involved in future investigative expeditions. What I find most interesting about this particular sighting is the \"murmured\" vocalizations that accompanied it. The witness stated that he thought some other hunters were coming up the ridge towards them, due to their footfalls and what he believed to be the conversation between them. I asked him to describe the sounds more distinctly, and he said it sounded like a couple of guys talking just out of earshot, where you could hear the tones, but couldn't make out the words. He also said that it may have been more like mumbling, though, as if those making it were within audible range, but weren't actually speaking in a coherent fashion. This incoherent mumbling seems to be more plausible, as he guessed that they were only about 10-15 yards away when they stopped, turned around, and retreated back down the hill. Due to his position on the ridge, and the amount of brush in the vicinity, he did not make visual contact with the subjects. He heard a series of 5 or 6 \"thumps\", at one second intervals, as the subjects retreated down the ridge, and then exposed themselves briefly at the bottom of the ridge. It would seem that, whatever they were, they covered a great distance of ground in well under 10 seconds, although the witness does not know the exact distance they travelled during the sighting. Although both father and son immediately thought it must have been a black bear, as that was the most reasonable explanation, both later decided that could not have been. The other thing that I find odd about this sighting is that only one series of \"thumps\" was heard leaving the area, and only one creature was seen at the bottom of the ridge. If I may be afforded a little speculative latitude, here are a couple of possible scenarios: A: The subject was in fact alone, and merely grunting or mumbling to itself prior to becoming alerted to the witnesses' presence. B: One subject retreated down the ridge, while the other simply slipped into some cover and stayed in the area. Many investigators on the \"hunting\" side of Sasquatch research have expressed a belief that the creatures will employ a \"bait and switch\" tactic to lure the unwary into a trap. I do not embrace this theory, but I am presenting it as a possibility. In closing, I find that this event is most compelling in that it is not easily explainable. The witnesses did not get a very good look at the subject at the bottom of the hill, and are not saying \"Yes, it was a Sasquatch\", however, much of the evidence, albeit circumstantial, points toward the possibility that it may have been.",
