Island County Animal Control Officer Carol Barnes said she was intrigued by the footprint photo and forwarded it to sources in the U.S. Department of Wildlife and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. Barnes hadn\u0092t heard back as of Tuesday. She did show the picture to Dr. Robert Bishop, Island County coroner, but he wouldn\u0092t guess as to the source, she said. Since the story of the six-year-old Black Angus cow\u0092s death appeared on Saturday\u0092s South Whidbey Record, both Schneider and Barnes have heard of other recent cow deaths. Poisonous weeds, such as hemlock or tansy ragwort, were considered possible causes, assuming they\u0092re in bloom. But none of the other cows had skin removed from half its face. Barnes is hoping pictures of the dead cow and footprint will get around the Internet and some solid information might turn up. \u0093As of now, we just don\u0092t know,\u0094 she said. photo by Javier Meja This fuzzy photo of a mysterious footprint was taken near the body of a cow that died in the Maxwelton area Feb. 22. The skin from half its face had been removed. ",
