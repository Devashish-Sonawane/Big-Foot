            "Follow-Up Report": "After reviewing the tape, doing a frame by frame analysis, and speaking with the film maker for some three months, I have come to the conclusion that the tape was not hoaxed.  The film was taken at dusk, and appeared to capture two unknown bipedal creatures in the background.  Because of the lighting conditions, details of the creatures are silhouetted.Weather conditions, including sunrise, sunset, and temperature, were cross referenced for the date of the video. They matched the conditions shown on the video for the time given.Subject one is a large bipedal figure . It appears to have a conical shaped head.  A second smaller subject apparently springs from the back of the big one and climbs into a tree, hand over hand, with great speed and agility. Subject one moves to the left of the screen perhaps fifteen feet, returns to its original location, stands in a wooded area, and apparently enters it after several seconds. All of this is in silhouette.The \"baby\" appears to have no tail.  After climbing the tree it swings out on a large branch approximately 20 feet in the air.The big one is on film for approximately 10-14 seconds; the \"baby\" for approximately 40 seconds.The property is privately owned, but allows camping, fishing and hosts ATV races. No pets are allowed on the property.  The campsite in the footage was set on the opposite side of the lake from the other campers.  There was a small outdoor music festival (100-200 people) happening on the property when the footage was shot.  At the entrance of the property, vehicles were searched for glass bottles and pets. One man tried to bring in a parrot and was turned a way.  A chimp or gibbon would have been difficult to miss ... even if someone dressed it up and put a Raiders hat on it ...The property owner did not know about this footage, and has not heard of any anomalous events on the property.See feature on the BFRO homepage for more information on this footage and follow up efforts.The initial follow up was by investigator Steve Kulls. Further follow up was done by investigator Paul K (lawyer - NYC).",
