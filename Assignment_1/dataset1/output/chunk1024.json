            "Follow-Up Report": "I was able to talk to this witness over the phone.  I asked her to recount the experience she had while camping with her friends. They were camping in a forested area the White River.  She told me essentially the same as she wrote it in the report. The behavior she describes is very much as would be expected from a curious sasquatch that was checking out a bunch of young adults having a good time and camping out. It is similar to what we have experienced on our own expeditions. It was quite upsetting to the witness to re-live the experience as she described what happened.During our interview, the witness clarified some questions that I had from reading her report. She helped me to understand exactly where she and her friends were camping and how to find the location.On 11/5/11 Several of us went in the late afternoon to investigate the site. We were able to locate two camp sites where the witness could have been. They are only about 50 feet apart, so either one could have been it, although I believe that the closer site was more similar to what she described. The place is well used by the local kids, and there is camping trash all over the area. It looks like they all party there. We searched the area of the camp sites for any evidence. We found none. This does not mean that the witness' account is a fabrication, because there have been many other people there since the encounter. We stayed until it started to get dark and cold, and then slowly started walking back down the river bank towards the trail leading out of the area. One of our party said that she heard some \u0093whoop\u0094 sounds from across the river. We stopped and looked across the river. Another of us tried a couple of her very loud whistles, but I did not hear any response. After walking a bit further, a large rock impacted the river bank with a thud behind us. We looked around but could not find the exact rock as we were on a field of rocks of similar size. However, it would take a large and athletic person to throw a rock that big, and there were no other people nearby. Our feeling was that the rock was thrown across the river, which would be at least a throw of 150 feet. Hearing and seeing nothing, we left the area. It was dark and very cold by the time we reached our vehicles.There are some interesting things to note about this area. I get reports from the Auburn valley along the Green River and White River. The White River provides an easy travel route from the slopes of Mt. Rainier and the forests surrounding it, all the way down to the Auburn Valley. It would be simple for a sasquatch to travel along the river from the Auburn valley all the way to the Cascades. The fact that we heard whoops and had a rock thrown at us is evidence of a sasquatch being there. I believe that this witness experienced a real sasquatch visitation to her camp site.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was contacted on 1/23/11.  He was very cooperative, and was happy to send me the photograph of the footprint.  The witness noted that at this time, the road that led to the Elwha River Trail was closed, making the journey from the ranger station to the trailhead a four or five mile walk.  The prints were found another one and a half miles down the trail.  Taking into consideration the location and the weather conditions, it is unlikely that a person was going barefoot on that trail.  The witness told me that the only people he saw on the entire trip were walking in as he was walking out on the road after the weather had cleared a bit.The quality of the footprint photograph isn't great, but it isn't bad either.  To avoid confusion with the larger impression, I have outlined the footprint.  Click the link above to see the print.Using the witness' 12 inch boot as scale (the witness measured it for me while we were on the phone), the footprint is approximately 13 inches long.",
