            "Follow-Up Report": "The Mining Journal is Marquette\u0092s major newspaper and the largest paper in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I was able to contact the submitter of the letter and we talked on the phone for an hour. She was very clear and expressive about the event. Her voice still sounded with the emotion in telling of her experience when she was 20 and her sister in-law was 21. I also spoke to her sister in-law who was the other witness to the event.On a day early in the month of September in 1970 they were traveling westbound on Highway 41 going home after visiting with some friends. They had just gathered together because their husbands were on an expedition to Alaska. It was a clear day and it was still light out and it was around sunset. While driving between Three Lakes and Tioga the driver noticed something cresting the hill on the south side of the road. She stopped her car and backed up to get a better view of the subject that was now standing still on the top of the hill.It was standing on two legs facing them and watching them, it had \u0093silver, white-ish fur\". It was from 7 to 8 feet tall but she couldn\u0092t be sure because it was standing on the top of the hill. \u0091It looked big.' It had long hair all over its body; the hair was layered hanging over its hands, face, and eyes. She said, \u0093It looked like the character Chewbacca in the movie Star Wars. It was one big flowing fur. It looked human but it was too big for a human.\"She couldn\u0092t be sure about any detail in the face because of the fur and the distance they viewed it at. She feels they viewed it at 100 to 150 feet for 30 seconds. They became unnerved and left and continued on home.I spoke to the second woman for half an hour on the phone; she was just as clear about the facts and circumstances surrounding their experience. She owns and runs a health care company now and it was difficult to get time with her on the phone. I asked her about people making light of their claims, she said she didn\u0092t care what they thought, \u0093We saw what we saw, we didn\u0092t ask to see it\u0094.  She said they were \u0093Stoned cold sober\u0094, and they had been drinking coffee the whole time while visiting with their friends.Despite the amount of time that has passed and the distance of the sighting, an artist agreed to work with the witness. The sketched image below was made with the witness\u0092 input. She wasn\u0092t sure about how the hair covered the face. If the subject\u0092s hair was growing out of the face, or if the hair hung down from the head. The sketch artist made a judgment call in this case. Note: to draw a subject on white paper you have to use a dark color for it to show up. The color of what they saw was white in color. ",
