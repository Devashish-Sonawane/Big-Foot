            "Follow-Up Report": "Witnesses were camping at the Wish Poosh on the north end of Cle Elum Lake.  They were not the only ones at that spot that evening, there were an estimated 30+ people.Around 0400 hours in the morning the witnesses were awakened by a sound that never changed pitched, and was to be estimated to be the only one in the area.  As the two came out of their tent, they noticed some of the other campers around them were trying to figure out the sound.The incident lasted around five minutes with each scream lasting in the neighborhood of about 6 seconds. According to mother, it was nothing she has heard before or since.  Q&AQ:  Do you camp at that area anymore?A:  \"No, we haven't been back to that spot since it happened.  We usually go camping that time of year, but won't go back to Wish Poosh Campground.\"\"Sound was comparable to a woman screaming in pain and a cougar, I have heard cougars scream before and there was no way it was a cougar.\"Q:  What direction did the scream originate?A:  \u0093It was to the north I believe, not coming from across the lake, but up on the hills above us.\"Q:  You think there was more than one?A:  \"No, it sounded like it was the only one, the pitch sounded the same every time, it screamed several times, don't know how long I was asleep and it awakened me.\"",

I really couldn't believe it due to the odds of me actually wanting to see it (trying to be objective here). I checked for claw marks, such as a bear would leave, and found none.",

I visited the site today, 6/3/00, for approx. 2.5 hours. Description on getting to the area is very good. Can add that from the Silver City Historical Marker, reading \"location of remains of city jail\", the trail/road the footprints were found off of is located .10 of a mile west of the sign. Trail/Road can be taken by either OHV or 4WD for only 1/4 of a mile, before you have to walk the remaining distance of 1/2 mile to the area witness described. \"Searched the area and did not find any footprints or other evidence (although there are some neat arch sites there). Trail/road shows signs of a lot of use by vehicles and hikers, so any signs could have been erased. To add to the environmental info: area is high desert forest with mostly pinyon, ceder, some bristlecone, jeffery, ponderosa pine, and sagebrush. Location is in a valley, surrounded on three sides by basalt/volcanic escarpments (the fourth or east side opens into the Markleeville area). Two of the sides (north and south) would take some expert rock climbing to get over, but the west side could be accessed by foot by following the river. Area is very rugid, and in the winter, it is completely shut down to human traffic. I also documented the area with photos.\"",
