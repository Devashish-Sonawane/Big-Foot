            "Observed": "While on a mountain-bike ride down ********* trail, located approx 17 miles northwest of Chelan Washington.  I came around a left-hand bend in the trail, which was proceeding up a ridgeline slope of moderate grade.  The trail was well packed and damp, as a rainstorm had preceded my biking trip by two days. This weather pattern was unusual for Central Washington in the late summer month of August.  I was biking alone, and the section of trail preceding my unidentified animal sighting was downhill and allowed me to ride quickly, making little noise.  As I proceeded around the left hand bend in the trail, my vision was drawn to a motion on the ridgeline that continued to my upward left.  What I saw was a tall (approx 8 ft), Dark brown, longhaired animal running rapidly in a bi-pedal manner from the exposed ridgeline in a northwesterly direction.  He remained in my line of vision as he ran through a moderately dense high alpine forest. It was astounding to me how quickly and quietly the animal was able to move for his sheer body size.  I immediately stopped my bike with the initial sight of this animal.  After stopping my bike, the animal remained within my sight for approx 10-15 seconds as he was running rapidly away from my intrusion.  There was no mistaking this animal's height as I am 6' 4\", and my estimate of 8 ft. may be a moderate estimate of actual height.  There also was no mistaking the bi-pedal pattern of running exhibitited by this unknown animal.  After seeing the animal run through the forest, I dropped my bike where I stood, and walked quietly down to the point where I saw him cross the trail.  The tracks of this animal showed poorly as the ground on either side of the trail was densely vegetated with low-lying grasses and shrubs. It was remarkable to see such a large animal move so quickly and efficiently through the density of the forest.  I looked for broken twigs, branches, or hair and found none. I failed to find tracks within the trail.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness, Ron, contacted the BFRO shortly after reading BFRO Report #27702, which occurred in the vicinity of the events described in his report.  After communicating with Ron over a period of weeks, I can add the following information to his report.  Ron holds a BS degree in Geography and a BA degree in Ancient Studies. He studied the history of mankind on the east coast of the Paleo period (13,000 YBP) to the Woodland period prior to Western influence. This background, and his Iroquois grandfather, exposed him to Native American folk lore describing sasquatch. As a researcher, Ron is meticulous in his observations and the data he gathers. Some weeks after discovering his work at ****, Ron discovered a fresh deer kill in the isolated restricted-access area where he conducted his studies. The deer was still warm, there were no gunshot wounds, its neck had been broken, there was evidence of a blunt force strike to the skull, and no part of the deer had been eaten or removed.  The area around the deer appeared heavily distributed, as if an altercation had occurred.  The only other object in the area was a pineapple-sized rock. The day after finding the deer kill, Ron was driving along the gravel access road and found a partially devoured hind leg from a deer. Ron observed tooth marks on the bone that were not canine but appeared flat, and \u00be inches wide. Ron went directly to the deer kill site and found the deer carcass completely slaughtered and devoured. The leg he found on the road seemed to be a hind leg that was now missing from the corpse. Each rib had been snapped off and cleaned to the bone. The internal organs were all missing, the eyes and tongue were gone as well. The three remaining legs were devoured to the bone, and separated from the boy for some distance. Other objects found at the kill site included small birch branches that appeared to have been chewed.  Deer hair strewn about the kill site was evenly distributed with the exception of one large area next to the body, where no deer hair appeared to have settled on the ground. In addition to the wood knocking incident described in the report above, Ron also experienced wood knocks and the sound of bipedal footsteps during his daylight research activities.  These occurred while in densely vegetated areas near the riverine islands. During my discussion with Ron of  his experiences in the ****, he mentioned that it was a habit for him to eat his lunch while in the forest.  And at the end of each meal, he would leave the last bite behind, uneaten. A tradition he learned from his grandfather, I mentioned to him that this could have been seen as a form of  \u0093gifting\u0094 on his part.  When I said this Ron realized that it could explain something which had puzzled him since those days. While hiking in the forested area Ron had taken up a walking stick to help negotiate the rough terrain of holes and roots. He used it every day, but one day his stick broke and he left it behind. The very next day he hiked to a log where he frequently rested and ate his lunch in the past. And in the spot where he regularly sat, a large, sturdy stick was left leaning against the log.  Ron felt it was a \u0093gift\u0094 in the tradition of his grandfather's folk lore, but never associated with potential sasquatch habits until I mentioned the subject.   Ron has the stick in his possession to this day, and cherishes it even more now. The Arundel Mills mall incident Ron refers to above is further documented in this BFRO Media Article 45.In addition to his own experiences, Ron also relayed the story of his Mother's childhood sighting, which she repeated to him frequently as he grew up: \u0093My first Bigfoot story came to me by my Mother when she was spending summers up in Chase, Maryland.  She told me that around 1964-65 she had a few repeated strange encounters while spending her summer vacations at her Aunt's home. During those summers she lived in a farm house with her Aunt where lots of old growth forest terrain surrounded the old house.   She told me that often her Aunt would tell my Mother that she could hear strange moans and sounds late at night coming from the forest, but not to worry.  My Mother was told that it was the Old Man in the woods and he was not interested in them. He lived there from long before and in fact was talked about by locals for 100's of years.  This being a normal Native American tradition passed down about nature from family members to the young ones.\u0094\u0093My Mother stated that over the year and a half she spent time there she heard many noises, mostly during the summer months. During the winter it was quiet.  She had never seen the creature until one very hot summer night during mid summer. She got yelled at for stealing and hiding her younger sister's favorite doll.  As night fell her Aunt was preparing them for bed and my Mother's young sister noticed that her doll was missing and started crying.  My Aunt yelled at my Mother to find it immediately.  Unfortunately my Mother had the doll a few hundred yards into the forest while she was playing there during the day. My Mother still says she was so used to hearing the late evening noises it never occurred to her as she went outside around 10 PM to get the doll.  As she quickly went into the woods with her flashlight in hand she grabbed the doll and at the moment she heard a huge screeching howl coming down on her. She says she was frozen and could not even move.  As she lifted her eyes up to the top of the hill in front in front of her she saw a huge dark shadowy image hunched over about 10 or so car lengths away. As she stood there frozen and scared the dark image stood up and slightly lifted its arms and let out another huge screeching howl and she immediately screamed and took off running. As she ran into the house her Aunt grabbed her and asked her if she was ok.  My Mother states that her Aunt kept saying that she forgot about sending her out in the forest late at night during this time of year.  That was the last month or so my Mom lived there and shortly after moved back home to Baltimore. My Mother told me this story all the time as I was growing up and told me that this was the complete truth and she has always wondered if the creature was still out there and what ever happened.\u0094While discussing the finer points of Ron's story over several weeks of communication, the elements of his experience were detailed and consistent. His heightened observation skills combined with unique access to a highly restricted government research area created a singular opportunity for a talented researcher to collect evidence of local sasquatch.  The Washington/Baltimore corridor is a region with a  cluster of fleeting reports going back to the 1970s, and reports such as Ron's, offer important clues to how a local population of sasquatch could continue to exist in such a well-developed area.
