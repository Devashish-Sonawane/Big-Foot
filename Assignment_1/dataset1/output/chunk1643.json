            "Follow-Up Report": "I first interviewed the witness the day after this report was submitted. During our long discussion, his enthusiasm about recording these unusual vocalizations, similar to those that he had heard previously, was clear and he was eager to offer them for the consideration of others. He thought it possible that the audio might be sasquatch-related given the other reports in the general area, because they sounded somewhat like some other supposed possible bigfoot recordings, and because he did not have what he considered to be any other likely explanation. The recordings were forwarded immediately thereafter. After review by myself and several other associates, I also considered them sufficiently unusual to merit their public release for the review of anyone so interested. I visited the location the following August, shortly after two additional and similar recordings were obtained, as part of frequent follow-up in recent years to many various reported observations in southwestern South Dakota. Due to many direct and credible witness contacts, personal and on-location visits and interviews, a fairly-thorough familiarity with the region, and an almost-certain sighting of my own, it is my opinion that the Black Hills and Pine Ridge Reservation region apparently provides a suitable and continuing habitat area for some of these creatures and further investigative efforts are intended.The following long recordings are complete, un-edited and as provided by the witness.First RecordingSecond RecordingDavid Petti",
