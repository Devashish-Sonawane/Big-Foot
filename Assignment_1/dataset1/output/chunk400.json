            "Observed": "We were heading home from work approximately 11pm. There was rain and we came up on what we thought was a person along side of the the road but as we got closer, what we saw was something that was around 7 feet to 7 1/2 feet tall.Long dirty shaggy yellow looking hair. Could not see the face well because of all the hair. It had a tarp or piece of plastic over it. It was getting ready to cross the highway from a wooded area. As we passed it, my friend and I started describing what we both had seen and cold chills ran through my body. We were going to turn around and see if we could figure out what it was, but were to scared to. I have never seen anything like that in my life. It was not a man, it was entirely too tall. For several months after the seeing it, I wouldn't drive US1 at night, I instead traveled I95.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to witness GD over the phone and she was able to provide more details about her sighting. While driving home from work with a friend at about 11pm they both spotted a large bipedal figure. GD stated she was only traveling at about 45 mph and that it was raining steadily when they saw it. It was standing right on the edge of the road on the passenger side of the car, facing toward them, and she guessed that the sighting lasted approximately 5-7 seconds. There was no other traffic on the road at the time.\u0093This thing was huge,\u0094 said GD. \u0093It was a lot taller than a basketball player and very broad in the shoulders with a wide trunk. I couldn\u0092t see its face because there was so much hair, but I could tell that it didn\u0092t have much of a neck. There was hair all over it. The hair was a dirty yellowish-blond color and it was shaggy and scraggly.\u0094When I asked her to describe the arms she stated, \u0093The arms were crossed over the chest and it was holding a yellow piece of tarp, or what looked like an old rain slicker, over its shoulders. I thought that it must have been trying to keep the rain off of it.\u0094After GD and her friend passed the figure they both remarked that it couldn\u0092t have been a human. That it was too tall, bulky and hairy. They discussed going back to get a better look, but by the time they reached a median break where they could turn around they opted to keep going. \u0093We were both scared by then.\u0094When they went to work the next day and told co-workers, GD said that some people scoffed at their story, while others remarked that they had seen a \u0091Huggy Molly\u0092, the local term for a bigfoot.GD has since lost touch with the friend that was with her that night.The area where the sighting took place has grown significantly since 1998. It is very close to the St. John\u0092s National Wildlife Refuge and the Carnival Marshes Conservation Area. It\u0092s very plausible that at the time of the sighting there were several corridors that extended from the conservation and protected areas to the outlying citrus groves, farms and swamplands that used to border US-1.",

            "Observed": "On Saturday night Sept 23, 2000 (last night) my wife and I were on our way back form dinner and were driving south on HWY 89 just south of Tahoma (west side of Lake Tahoe), about 100 yards north of the Sugar Pine Point State Park Campground turn off when my headlights illuminated what appeard to be a furry animal crossing the road. When it saw our vehicle approaching it began to run from the center of the road to the other side into the trees as we passed. The general motion was from right to left heading west to east toward the lake form the campgroud area.  The strange thing was that it was clearly not a bear or any kind of four legged animal. It had a distinkt two legged run as I would expect a human to have, but was covered with hair (or fur) that was much longer than that of other furry animals and had a rust colored hugh to it. It ran slightly bent over and had medium hight (5-6'). It happened too fast to make out special features like feet, hands or the shape of the head. I could only see the running form of the body.",

The hair was described as being reddish brown, 4 inches in length across the entire body, and shaggy.  It's body build was that of a human, thinnish, around 5'4\" to 6', and est. weight of 200 pounds.  It did not have a snout or ears like a bear would.  When it ran, it ran on upright on two legs, with its arms held tightly to its side.  Both witnesses felt that due to its size, that this was a \"young one\".",
