            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this student at length about his experience. He and two friends were walking back from class to their dorms on North Henry Street, along the South side of Lake Mendota, near the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin. It was dusk, and they were descending steps near a cliff to traverse the frozen lake surface. Suddenly, they saw a 7-8 foot tall creature, covered in dark hair, approx.100 feet in front of them, next to  a stand of bushes and trees. They described it as big and broad, like Shaquille O'Neal, only 70-100 pounds heavier. It was at the shoreline among bushes, and was picking at vegetation. It saw them, and they stopped, in their tracks, scared. They were intimidated, saying \"It felt like your Dad had just yelled at you.\" They thought of running, but stayed their ground and watched for 20 seconds, when the creature began making a \"low pitched purring noise\", which turned into a growl. The three students were starting to turn, when the creature ambled  into the woods, on two legs, loudly crunching branches, and trees as it went away.Total duration of the sighting was 45 seconds. Logan took a picture of it on his cellphone, via SnapChat. (The picture is now gone). He described the eyes as red and glowing, very large for the face. There are dumpsters along the lake edge, outside the fraternity houses there. Some woods, but most are on the opposite side of the bay. They smelled nothing. Weather was cold. They knew not what it was, and began to Google possibilities, finding the BFRO site to report the incident.I followed up on another report that we received a few days prior, of a sighting of a large black creature in a field just a few blocks away.  Two girls were walking a trail at dusk when they saw it, and their description matches this report.  I know one of the girls personally and she is trustworthy and honest. ",

We went deep into bottom later that evening and heard tree knocking from 3 different locations. We sat til after dark and continued to hear unexplainable noises. After dark in total darkness, we heard objects being thrown thru wooded area at us. I was too afraid to wait around. This property is located approx 6 miles south of Monkstown Tx.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness and I found him to be very credible, and consistent in his reporting. The area where this happened is on private property usually only accessed by him and a few other family members for hunting.He found a cedar tree about 2\" in diameter twisted and broken and after further investigation found a limb about 4 to 5 feet off the ground broken on another tree. While looking around that tree he found a 14\" print below the broken limb and another smaller print on the other side of the tree. He stated that it had rained the day before, but now the ground was dry and he was unable to make a print himself.Later that same evening he returned with his wife, who has heard stories of sightings and noises around this area over the years. They sat down and right before dark they did some wood knocks and got return knocks from three different directions and at different distances. Some single knocks and some multiple. Once the area was completely dark they started to hear noises as if something was being thrown at them, then something small hit his wife's shoulder and she got scared and started crying so they left for the evening. The next day he returned on a four-wheeler to the same location and found small pebbles lying around in the sand. He stated to me that this area had no rocks or pebbles anywhere around except for the few that were laying there where they were sitting. He continued to the creek bed, where he heard some of the knocks coming from the night before, and found more prints.The witness also told me about a possible sighting he had about a year and a half ago while hunting the same property. He stated that he was in a tree stand when he noticed what seemed like a man walking about 1000 yards away across the ridge. As he watched the individual he noticed that the subject didn't have a rifle or a hat on so he ruled out that it was another hunter. He continued to watch the subject through binoculars as the subject entered the tree line and he waited for it to come out on the other side which opened up to a field. The subject never came out of the tree line. He stated that if it was another person they would have had to walk about 10 miles to get to the point where he saw it.",
