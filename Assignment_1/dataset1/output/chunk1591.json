            "Observed": "This happened in summer sometime between 1980-82 approximate. My then husband and I liked to hike. We lived in Lake George,N.Y. and were aware of the rangers road up the back of Prospect Mtn. We foolishly figured it wuld be an hour up and and hour back and we'd be home by supper and didn't take a flashlight. It took 2 hours up and the sun was beginning to wane. Now my husband had a habit of walking very fast sometimes out of my sight and I kept yelling, almost crying,\" Wait ,wait for me!\"As it got near dusk, the road was darker and darker and I finally grabbed and held on to his arm so I wouldn't be left alone and behind. Then we heard something big crunching up the ground just off the road in the woods beside us and following along with us.If we stopped, it stopped. I couldn't tell if it was one or more but I think just one. aAll down the Mtn until we got to where the road kind of levels out for at least an hour or more that thing was in the woods following.He figured it was deer or a bear but would those animals do that? Then recently when I read that teens on the bike trail near French Mtn thought they saw something in 81 or 82 or 83 I began to wonder. The bike trail goes a long ways following route 9 right into Lake George and Prospect Mtn is on the other side of rt 9 not many miles away.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness over the phone on 11/24/2006. I can add the following comments.The animal approached after the witness yelled for her husband. It followed them all the way down the mountain even though they were aware of its presence and talking very loud to try and scare it away. The witness said she was sure the animal was very large and not a deer. She could tell this by the sound of the forest floor crunching every time the animal would take a step. This would seem rare behavior for a large predator such as a bear or cougar and even more rare behavior for a deer. If this was a bear or a cougar it would have most likely fled or attacked during the duration of the stalking.",

I had been there about 4 hours and was leaving when I got on the lake shore I noticed about 300 yards away something in the water on the other shoreline. At first I thought it was just a stump but then it got up and moved. It was a good distance away but I know it was no bear. It never noticed me and keep soaking in the water. As i climbed up the dam to leave it must have seen me because it got up and walked to shore. I didn't see it as I finished crossing the dam to leave.",
