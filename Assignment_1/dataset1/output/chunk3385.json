            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with one of the witnesses at length about their incident that night.  What really stuck out to both of them was the fact that they didn't hear anything at all, before and after the object was thrown near the boat.  This fact, combined with the seemingly large weight of the object and the distance it was thrown, led them to doubt that it was somebody fooling around with them.  Also, they both felt that it was not a fish or animal jumping in the water.They had spotlighted the shoreline after this without seeing a thing.The shore in the area where the object was supposedly thrown from is very tall grass, giving way to trees some distance back from the shore.  Rock throwing seems to be a common method sasquatches use to intimidate humans to leave an area.  The rocks are usually thrown near an individual/group, rather than hitting them.  I have experienced this myself on two occasions, in northern Wisconsin and West Virginia.  ___________________________________Editor's Note (Matt Moneymaker)Salamonie Lake is over 15 miles long if you navigate it by boat. It's a long snaking damned-up river. The damn was built in 1966 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The reservoir it created is roughly 2,600 acres of water. Indeed, this is the sort of place where a sasquatch in Indiana would seek refuge -- near reliable sources of fish and deer. Sasquatches will wade into creeks and slow moving rivers to catch catfish. If it was a sasquatch throwing the rock in this case, the purpose was to deter the people who were removing the catfish. Salamonie reservoir would be a good place to use a thermal imager from a boat with no lights and a quiet electric motor.  From a half-mile away a thermal imager could spot a sasquatch in pitch black darkness wading into this river-lake.",
