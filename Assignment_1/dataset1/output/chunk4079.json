            "Observed.1  ": "I always like finding news of the offbeat, weird variety but this was the strangest case I had ever encountered. Keep in mind, too, this was before television and Hollywood made commonplace the mysterious myths and unknown, sometimes otherworldly, subjects we can see almost weekly on cable television. I'm not sure where Bud picked up his initial information but after asking lots of questions to a Cashton-area farm family, I decided there was enough credible information to write a story. Editor Ken Teachout agreed, and the Cashton Bigfoot became familiar to thousands of Coulee Region Tribune readers. The original story and a follow-up both ran on Page One that week. The farmer, who asked to remain anonymous, was in the company of his dog early one morning a quarter-century ago when he saw, standing among his cows, a creature that does not belong in the farmland of Wisconsin, or perhaps anywhere else. It was described as being about 8 feet tall, very broad shouldered, with long dark hair all over its body and having an almost human face.     It stood erect and walked on two feet. Even at a distance of 25 or 30 yards, the creature had a distinct foul odor. The farmer and the creature stared at each other for several seconds, neither one moving until the farmer's dog \u0097 a large collie-shepherd mix \u0097 ran at the intruder. The big creature swiped at the dog with one of its hands, and the frightened dog headed for the house and was scared to leave the porch for several days, the farmer told me. \"I've never seen (the dog) afraid of anything before,\" I recall him saying. As the dog ran off, the creature turned away, took one step over a barbed wire fence that bordered the pasture, and with one or two long strides was in the woods and out of sight. Fearing he would not be believed, the farmer told no one but his wife and a family member about his sighting. For at least two nights, the farmer and a male relative went into the woods just before dark with their high-powered deer rifles. They weren't sure whether they were going to shoot the beast if they got the chance, or just wanted to have the weapons for protection in case the bigfoot, or whatever it was, became aggressive. They heard the Bigfoot several times, the farmer said, and their hunting stand in the woods was circled loudly, numerous times. The creature made no attempt to walk quietly and made lots of grunting noises, and they could smell the nauseating stench so often reported with Bigfoot sightings. The farmer's wife told me that after her husband's sighting, some earlier strange occurrences around their property became more understandable. For instance: \u0097 They sometimes detected a strange, musty odor that seemed to cling to the cows when they came in from spending the night in the pasture. \u0097 Sounds they had heard in their hay mow (the area above the milking parlor portion of the barn). \"It sounded like someone was moving hay bales around,\" the woman said. \"We thought our son probably got up early and was playing up there, so we didn't think much more about it.\" Later, however, they found the boy still asleep in his bed, and indeed, some hay bales had been moved about, and that same musty smell was in the barn. They also found a large stained spot about 10 feet up on one of the hay barn timbers that looked like it had been used by an animal to mark its territory \u0097 much as a male dog will announce its presence in a neighborhood by urinating on a tree or fire hydrant. The beam still smelled strange weeks later when I climbed up there to take a whiff. Of course, I had no way of knowing what I was smelling. So why did I bother smelling it? Beats me, but it had an almost skunk-like smell. Anyway, the Cashton Bigfoot was never seen again, as far as I know, and story died after a few days when there was nothing more to report. I don't know whether the mystery creature was the cause, but the family who lived on the farm and had those unsettling experiences moved away. The descriptions and details of the Cashton mystery sound very much like the ones related on the Outdoor Life Network's television program \"Mysterious Encounters,\" which was shown weekly until the outdoor channel became the Lance Armstrong bicycle racing channel. Now that the Tour de France is over, perhaps Autumn Williams and her team of Bigfoot hunters and biologists will return to their pursuit to find the truth about alleged creatures such as this. They have been reported for hundreds of years in nearly every part of North America, with the most active areas being the Pacific Northwest and the swamps and bayous of the South. But now and again they are spotted by seemingly honest, serious-minded citizens in any number of places \u0097 including the Coulee Region. Oh, I almost forgot. Very few mainstream scientists or zoologists believe there is proof of the existence of a Bigfoot animal. Me? I've never seen one, and I really don't want to see one in the forest \u0097 but I would like to know for sure.

            "Observed.1  ": " Staff writer Published: Sunday, March 23, 2014 at 9:12 p.m.    Photo courtesy Denise DeChenes  A copy of an image taken by Denise DeChenes that she perceives to be Bigfoot is shown.  Most people think Bigfoot is a hoax. But Denise DesChenes is convinced that she has seen the mythical creature \u0097 once in person, and other times when it was unknowingly captured in pictures and videos she took during walks in the Goethe State Forest. DesChenes never believed in Bigfoot before. She said she really never had time to pay attention to what was around her when she used to ride horses in the woods. But what she has witnessed over the last few years during her walks in the woods has changed her mind. \u0093I hear them walking with me and I know they're there,\u0094 she said, deliberately using the plural. DesChenes said there is more than one creature out there. DesChenes said she stopped riding her horses in the Goethe State Forest because her bad back made riding too painful. Instead, she started taking long walks with her dog in the forest and other preserves near Dunnellon. \u0093When I started walking, that's when I started noticing things,\u0094 she said. She started taking still pictures and video and remains convinced that, in the background, she has captured Bigfoot. She has even asked professional photographers their opinions on what the large footprints and dark figures lurking around bushes and trees could be. \u0093I just had to ask someone else,\u0094 she said.   According to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) website, www.bfro.net, there have been several other Bigfoot sightings in the same area over the past several years: two in the Goethe State Forest, which is in Levy County, and another in Rainbow Springs State Park near Dunnellon. According to a witness report on the BFRO website, on Jan. 9, 2012, a hunter in the Goethe State Forest claimed to see some scrapings high up on a tree \u0097 and higher than any animal native to the area could make. The entry then states: \u0093I went further into a game trail and I heard a noise as if someone, or something, was flanking me. It moved when I moved.\u0094 As it got darker, the same entry states, the hunter heard an unfamiliar screech/growl and later found large footprints. Another witness report on the BFRO website registers a strange encounter in the Goethe State Forest in September 2005. The report describes a morning sighting of Bigfoot. Two witnesses claim they observed \u0097 and were watched by \u0097 two \u0093Skunk-Apes\u0094 for about 10 minutes. They also claim they found large footprints. In the same report, these witnesses claim they smelled something like a dead/rotting carcass mixed with the smell of a skunk. DesChenes does not claim to have smelled anything or heard any screeches or howls. But she does have an unusual ritual that she believes helps draw Bigfoot to her during her walks in the woods. She said that before entering the woods, she prays and waves and says \u0093hi\u0094 before starting off. She said that she has also left gift baskets in the woods containing items such as beef jerky and crackers, and sometimes loose tobacco. She thinks this might attract the Bigfoot creatures to her the next time she returns because the items she left on previous walks were always gone when she returned. According to Re Monteith, a BFRO investigator, it is not unusual for Bigfoot to accept gifts. However, many other animals in the forest will take food and objects as well, she said. As a researcher, she states that it is important to know what to look for to eliminate any misunderstandings. In some instances BRFO investigators have found that Bigfoot can also leave gifts in return, Monteith said. Examples could be unusual rocks, flowers or stick arrangements, turtle shells, shells, nuts and even gutted animals. Many times the objects are not from the local area, she said. According to Monteith, BFRO has about 10 investigators in Florida who investigate anything reported to them. The reports are only posted on the BFRO website if the witness appears credible. She adds that Ocala and the surrounding area are very active for sasquatch activity. DesChenes has not contacted BFRO about her alleged encounters with Bigfoot, nor does she have a witness report filed with the group. A spokeswoman for the Florida Forest Service declined comment when asked whether her agency investigates any such sightings.   Copyright \u00a9 2014 Ocala.com \u0097 All rights reserved.
