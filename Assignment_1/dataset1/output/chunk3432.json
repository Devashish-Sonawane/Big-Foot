            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for about three hours over the phone.  He no longer lives in Idaho but remembers all the details of what he and his friend experienced that evening.The witness was familiar with the area because of the claims that he tried to acquire. He had given a lot of information about the history of the area he was prospecting, who had this claim from this year and when they moved on, etc.The week prior when he was scouting area, he mentioned that he was being followed by something that always stayed behind him, never made its presence known. The witness never smelled or heard any type of vocals that day.  He just remembers that everything went quiet, no birds, chipmunks or other animal noises.  He did come across a print in the sand that was not too distinct but large and odd in shape.  He said that it was fresh, because the next day when out near the area he again looked at the print and noticed the drying of the edges. \"Now that I think about it, I would associate that print to what happened to us later that night. I wouldn't say that I disbelieved in bigfoot, but knew them to be out there\".\"What happened later that evening I will never forget.\"  The witness went on to say, \"This bigfoot never came within the light of the lantern or the small campfire that was built. It stayed out of the lighted areas; it started this scream that can only be described as a woman screaming, just the pitch of the scream, no words\".\"As this sound continued it never took in another breath.  It started out as a high pitch and then got lower, and the strangest thing was when it finished it almost sounded like a wolf howling... ALL IN ONE BREATH.\"  According to the witness, it sounded as though the subject was spinning or turning as sound was made.  When it finished with its howl it was as though it was facing the witness and the height of the sound was well above witness. He estimated to be within thirty feet of subject producing sound.As he looked to where the sound was coming from, he stated that this vocal was too powerful to be a man or any animal that he was familiar with in the area and when it finished the latter part of the howl was directed at me.  It did not want us around and the height of that scream was well over my head but \u0093My friend was in denial the whole time of the screaming.  He was the only other person out there at the time.  I had asked him what he thought it might have been.\"  \u0093I don't know\"After the scream, the witnesses wanted to pack up camp, but because of where their truck was located, \"It was too dangerous for us to just pack up and leave, had to stay there\".The witness stated that it seemed that the subject was trying to get to its bedding area underneath an old cabin.  The roof of the building looked at though something was using it for shelter....\" I bet if someone returns to the site, they may retrieve hairs from underneath that roof\".\u0093I since lost contact with my partner over the years and to this day he still probably does not believe what we encountered that night was a bigfoot. After all, what kind of animal produces a sound like that, pretends to charge and then up and leaves?\u0094",
