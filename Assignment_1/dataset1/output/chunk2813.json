He occasionally heard wood knocking and the sounds of bipedal walking trailing him along the woodline. The source of the footfalls always remained out of sight, just behind vegetation. There is abundant game in the area as deer, bear, turkey, and squirrel are seen around the camp. He has not told anyone living near the area about the sounds he experienced. Coyotes are seen and heard in the Tygart River valley. He had listened to the sound recordings on the BFRO website but any distant sounds may have been coyotes. He searched the internet for Sasquatch information following his experience and discovered the BFRO webpage. Speaking to an investigator was a relief to the witness. He had nobody to talk with about the incident near his home in Elkins, WV. ",
