It was man-like and hairy, but that it seemed to have eyes that were \" sunk in \". He reported that he was scared and did not look at it long. Other incidents included a tale from his grandfather of \"something\" coming into he area and stinking up the canyon and sometimes stealing sheep when it was around. His father had also reported to him that the same kind of creature had once tried to find a way to enter the pickup shell topper, in the Chuska Mountains, while he sat fearfully inside with a rifle in hand. His father said the creature smelled very badly and that he would have shot it had it found a way to open the locked entrance door to the pickup topper. One other event happened when a sheep went missing and several of the older children went looking for it and reported being chased by one of the hairy giant man-like creatures. According to J.B. the family thought that the creatures probably migrated in and out of the Chuska Mountains, as they were not always around.",
