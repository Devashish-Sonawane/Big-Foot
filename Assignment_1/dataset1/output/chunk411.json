            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and her daughter live in Lake Helen, an area that has a rich history of sasquatch activity. There was so much activity in the 70\u0092s that the town now refers to the creature as the Mole Man.The witness is aware of the Mole Man stories, but hasn\u0092t put much faith in them until recently. On the night of February 24, 2013 around 9 PM, the witness and her daughter were getting ready for bed. Both were in the bathroom talking when something hit the side of the house. It was so loud and powerful, the wood frame house shook. Thinking someone might be trying to break in, they turned on all the outside lights, looked through the windows and saw nothing but called the police. The police looked around outside with flashlights and didn\u0092t find anything. A few nights later, at about 3 AM they were both awakened by another house shaking slam to the house, followed by a loud, deep, growl. In both cases, the house slam came from the same area \u0096 just under the master bedroom window.I spoke with the witness and then visited her property shortly after the incidents.  The property is about a half mile from the 1970\u0092s Mole Man orange grove reports. It is just over a mile away from the Mole Man reports from the summer of 2012. See report #36112. The property is heavily wooded as is the whole area.  A power line road runs along the backside of her property. She has a compost pile that she adds leftover food to, and several berry trees. And has never had anything like this happen in the many years she has lived there.On location, outside the bedroom we discovered that several branches from the landscaping were broken and the grass was mashed down indicating something had been behind it.  The entrance to the basement is just to the side and beneath the master bedroom. Next to the basement entrance is the banister and steps that go up to an outside porch.  When we tried to recreate the sound and shake on the house, the closest we came to recreating the sounds was produced by slamming the basement door. The door is always locked so we know the door wasn\u0092t slammed, but banging hard on the bulkhead of the door made a similar noise. Further inspection showed that something heavy climbed on the porch railing, then pushed off it, breaking it and landing on the roof, see photos:The witness knows that the railing wasn\u0092t broken prior to the events. On the night of the first incident they were talking and had the TV on. Standing outside by the bedroom one can hear the interior sounds. We know sasquatches are very curious of women and children; it is very plausible to say one could have been standing outside listening.After trying to recreate the sound and noting the outside damage to the rail, it is clear that something climbed the railing, and pitched off of it to get on the roof. The pitch of the roof is very high. I think something literally jumped from the rail to the roof, breaking the rail as it pushed off so it landed harder than anticipated (which was the shaking slam), and it then gave an angry growl because it landed so hard. We also noted the soffit trim was bent, when there is no reason for the damage. There have been bears in the area before, but none that have banged the house, and black bears do not growl. Further investigation revealed some interesting stories from the neighbors that could be considered more Mole Man activity.  One neighbor could have sworn that a tall homeless person slept on her porch from time to time as big indentations were seen on the chaise lounge. No one ever saw a homeless person in the vicinity, nor was any trash or evidence found of a homeless person living in the area.  Also, another neighbor\u0092s dog was attacked in the very early morning by something that practically ripped out its intestines. The veterinarian who operated on the dog could not explain what attacked it. The doctor said it did not look as if it was an alligator, panther, bear or hit by a car. The dog survived and will not go outside by itself anymore. In April, the witness called me again and reported another visit. While watching a violent movie with surround sound, a scream was heard over the sound. Whatever screamed was again near the master bedroom. She is confident that it was not a coyote. The witness contacted me once again recently to update recent activity on her property. This is the first report of the \"Mole Man\" in a few months. During the month of October 2013 several things occurred. Her teenaged daughter was in the car around 8 PM. Having recently pulled in for the night, she was looking through the back of the car for a CD. As she was doing so the car was violently shaken by something unseen. She could tell the car was pushed down from the front end of the car. She quickly ran inside without hearing or seeing anything. Two nights later while the family watched TV, the back door was shaken and banged on. The owner grabbed a gun and as the girls moved toward the back door the front door handle was suddenly raddled and banged on. The dog which is very protective and normally barks did not react. Since the last incident they have been hearing strange unidentifiable noises from the woods and their dog acts strangely when the sounds are heard. The owner reports that she has had a large amount of deer on the property until recently. I advised her to stop adding food to their compose pile and to walk together when they go outside until their \"Mole Man\" moves on or calms down. Because of all this recent activity, Investigator Staten visited the home and met with the witnesses, the following are his notes:- Deep powerful howl from the front of her house while the front and back doors were wide open (yes, the witness likes to keep them open in the evening when the weather is nice). Uncertain source, but very loud.- Witness\u0092 daughter having her parked car shaken back and forth, just outside the house, while she was in it playing with the new CD player (this gave me the creeps).- Horrible stench outside the house for 2 days, and for the first time ever her golden retriever refused to go outside without the witness, even during the day.

            "Observed": "I was in the Love Valley Wildlife Management Area hunting feral hogs. I had been sitting on my stand for about two hours when I began to smell something akin to cat urine or skunk musk, and I thought that with the prevailing winds a large boar must have just crossed the ridge above me. So after a little while when the odor did not decrease I decided to see if I could circle around the top of the ridge and get a shot at the boar. I left my stand and moved about 60 yards down the base of the ridge (away from my hunting buddies who were in two different stands further down the base of the ridge) to a well used game trail and began my ascent. I got about halfway up the slope and something came flying through the air to my right and then after another step or two something came thought the air to my left this time by the sound of its landing and crashing through the brush, something much heavier than the first object. At this time I froze and began to scan the ridge line first with my eyes and then with my rifle scope, and I began to think that one of the guys I was hunting with was playing a prank on me. So I continued to climb the hill until a large piece of rock (it looked like a piece of ruined tombstone from the abandoned cemetery on the hill top but I am not sure) landed just at my feet and rolled down the hill with some force and momentum behind it. At almost that same moment I caught just the faintest glimmer of movement and from that was able to make out the shape of what looked like a huge man. I am 6' 2\" and 260 lbs but this thing was at least 9-10' tall and three or four times as broad as I am. I slowly brought my rifle and scope up to get a better look at it. Most of it was covered by brush and under growth but its head down to its upper chest were clearly visible. It had a shaggy coat (the breeze did a fair job of breaking up its silhouette) that was dark colored even with the aid of my scope all I could tell was that the beast was covered in fur and that it was of dark coloration. Its eyes seemed impossibly small for the size of its oblong head. I watched it with my scope for perhaps a minute or it could have been ten, I honestly could not tell you as I was not sure whether to be fascinated or terrified (from its size and mass I was not sure the 30-06 I had in my hands would be sufficient if I needed to be terrified). After a period of time I took one slow step back and then another after about my third slow step back down the hill the beast slowly turned as if to disregard me and my rifle and walked away in the other direction. After it was gone I found the piece of stone that had landed on the path in front of me and tumbled past and as I said before it could have been a piece of one of the crumbling tombstones from on top of the ridge or it could have been rock from some other source but I can tell you that I could not have thrown it at least not as far or with the same force as this rock had been thrown. I would estimate it to have weighed around 45-55 lbs.  After that I proceeded to go back down the base of the ridge to where both of my friends were still sitting in their stands one about 80 yards down from where I was set up and the other about 90 yards from the first. I have not shared this with them or anyone but my wife for fear of ridicule, but that is my story and it is what happened to me.",
