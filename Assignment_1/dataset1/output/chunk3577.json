            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.The witness has sixteen years in law enforcement and is an avid big game hunter. As stated, his friend was ahead of him on a trail just wide enough for the ATV, about fifty inches wide. The figure was about four feet off the trail.When the figure stood, he saw it for about four seconds as he came upon and passed it. Its eyes were yellow from the headlight of the ATV and the witness was focused on the head, dark skin face, shoulders and arm. He did not have a chance to look at the legs. He does not think the Bigfoot was trying to hit him but the arm straightened and started to extend into the trail so he ducked his head.The arm was maybe four feet long including the shoulder, with a hand as big as the face of the witness. The palm was down and had long fingers that slightly curved, maybe due to knuckles bending. The nose was not too flat, but had a little bridge similar to a human. He saw one nostril. He said it was not a bear nose. The eyes were set back and he saw a brow ridge a couple inches above the eyes. Then the hairline began. The head was not too large but was leaning forward so he did not see a neck or chin. It was about eight feet tall, stocky, broad shoulders three and one half to four feet wide. It had smooth dark brown hair, about two inches long. He could not guess on a weight, only that it was several hundred pounds. He did not see ears or teeth. They did not see any wildlife on this trail but had seen mountain goats and deer on other trails. His friend did not see the figure but could tell the witness was \"shaken\" when arriving back at camp.The witness said, \"I remember it as if it was yesterday.\"",
