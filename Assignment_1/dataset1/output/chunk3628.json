            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone about what he heard that night. The reaction of his dog was very strange.  It has never had that reaction to anything before (she would go after anything outside), and was never reluctant to be outside at night.  Also, the howl he heard shook him up and made him nervous, which didn't subside until morning. The witness stated that the howl was not comparable to anything he has heard before or animal sounds he has subsequently heard online via his sister's computer.  He started searching out the vocalizations on the BFRO website, and found that what he heard that night closely matches the 2004 Moaning Howl from Mississippi. The howl came from the wooded Baugo creek area, which flows north into the St. Joseph River.  The far side of the creek from the witness' house is cornfields and houses.   This location is not too far from a possible sighting that occurred in 2000 (see Report #1786 ).Below is an aerial view of the Baugo creek area where the howl was heard:I later was told about a possible encounter at this same area, by this witness's sister:\"In September 2008, it was night time, and the air conditioner was running, I was putting the pillows back on the couch, and when I came up, in front of me about 10 foot is the south window. I have a thin curtain over it. The curtains are not flesh with the wall, and there is a small light in the corner. I seen two red eyes refelcting through the window. I do not know how long it lasted, and I did not hear anything, becuse the air conditoner was running.I dont know if it was the same night, but it was in the same month of September. My husband and I were in bed, I was reading and he happen to look out at the west windwo, he said \"What the freak is that?\"- again it was the same pair of red eyes reflecting through the curtain. It was about 5 to 10 seconds. Again we did not hear anything, the air condtioner was running.The next day, there was no prints or anything outside our windows. I did measure from where we seen the eyes, and it was 7 foot. We have not seen or have heard anything since.\"",
