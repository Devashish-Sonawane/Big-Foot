            "Observed": "We were traveling home, from Kalkaska, about  dusk. When we came around a bend and our head lights hit an animals eyes glowing back, the driver being an avid hunter, backed up to inquire. A smaller than you normally hear of, lighter in color, Bigfoot was there. It, at first sight, was sitting with its leg crossed on a log. When our headlights hit it, it stood up startled, and strode into the woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On 6/28/11 I spoke with the witness via phone. This sighting happened many years ago, but the witness remembered the event very clearly. As she lives near me, I am familiar with the area and the location of the sighting.   She stated that during the fall of 1977 they were coming back from Kalkaska, after visiting her brother-in-law. It was fully dark and she was in the passenger seat, with her husband driving and children in the back seat. As they were driving, they seen the eyes of an animal illuminate and her husband slowed and swung the car towards the eyes to illuminate them as they looked different than the typical shine of a deer. As the head lights hit the animal, it stood up and casually walked into the woods, disappearing.   She described it as very light in color, comparing the color to that of a camel.  It was quite small, around 5 1/2 feet tall, with a slight build.  She got a good look at the face and described it as kind of ape like, but also human like.     The area just south of the sighting is called the Dead Stream Swamp.   It is very large, covering four different counties and has some very remote areas to it.  I have mountain biked in it and can attest to the remoteness of it. The swamp teems with wildlife, including deer, one of Michigan's largest black bear populations and also the occasional mountain lion sighting. It also provides several waterways, including some small streams with brook trout.  The area surrounding is part of the Pere Marquette State Forest and the Au Sable State Sorest. Camp Grayling National Guard base is also to the north and encompasses a vast area. The area is definitely capable of supporting a population of sasquatch. ",
