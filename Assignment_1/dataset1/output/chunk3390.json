            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness twice via phone. Former military and quite precise in recollection. It was a matter of fact recounting of events. Everyone knows they are around these parts, just not spoken about in public. His feeling was that he saw a family unit. Male, female, and juvenile. The male, and lead creature, was a dirty brown color. The second or \"female, less masculine\" one was in the middle, and juvenile was last. Male was estimated to be no less than 6.5-7 ft. tall. Very bulky and super wide at shoulders. The second one was just smaller overall and he just felt it was \"feminine\" due to lack of bulk and overall size difference. Juvenile seemed to be 4-5 ft tall. They were \"walking with purpose\" as though they had a set destination in mind. They did not look back at him, nor hurry their gait just because he was there. The entire event was between 5-8 seconds. It was a 2 lane highway, at least 20 feet from shoulder to shoulder, and the male crossed the road easily in 4-5 steps. He went back and stepped it off at a later time and he had trouble coming close to that stride without maybe pulling a muscle. I have no reason to doubt this witness.",
