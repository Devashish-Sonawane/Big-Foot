I can't even begin to describe how loud and forceful these sounds were.  I listened to the sounds for a couple of minutes before leaving the area.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was target shooting on an abandoned strip mine. He had just finished emptying a 15 shot magazine when he heard an extremely loud wood knock. His description was, \"It sounded like someone was breaking fence posts against a tree.\" He estimated the distance to the source was around 200-300 feet down hill. The extreme volume produced by the knocking made him hesitant to search for the source. Leaving the area seemed the best course of action for a lone individual. This incident took place within 5-miles of another Shady Springs area sighting. He recently became interested in bigfoot after helping his son with a school project. They used the BFRO website content as the primary reference.He also reflected upon a hunting story from last November. A hunter shot a deer and something stole it. The hunter saw the deer fall, removed his tree stand, found the blood spot where the deer died, but no trail leading away from the kill site. Whatever took the deer had to have enough strength to lift it clear of the ground and move through logging slash to exit the area.",

I wanted to see something ahead of us real quick before heding back to my house so he sits down while i go ahead. I walk about 50 feet, not quite out of sight of my friend when this HUGE, tall hairy creature was kneeling. I turned to run and it chased me! I caught up with my friend. I didnt have to tell him what i saw. He saw it and ran with me. We got out of the woods and turned around and it was gone. No noises or nothing. We didnt bother to tell anyone. We were both white because my mom asked what was wrong but we said nothing and went on about our business. We never forgot it though.",
