            "Follow-Up Report": "I was eager to investigate this case because I live in the area where it occurred.  I interviewed the witness by telephone on 4-1-11 and found his story to be very credible.The witness grew up in northeast Washington and has hunted this area extensively.  As a young man in the mid-1980's he often went on solo camping and hunting trips.  On one such trip, in October, he was sitting near his campfire just at dusk when he heard a howl unlike anything he'd ever heard before.  He said the howl started out at a low pitch, lasted for about 10 seconds, ending at a higher pitch.  The howl was repeated at least once, maybe twice.  The witness says he is familiar with many animal vocalizations and, although he had never before heard a bigfoot howl, this sound was so unusual and so powerful that he instantly suspected it was produced by a bigfoot.A few years later, the witness was talking with his father-in-law, who related that he had actually seen a greyish-brown bigfoot near Sherman Creek Pass on Highway 20.  This is very near the location where the witness had previously heard the howl described above.  (This is within a few miles of BFRO Report #9286, in which a motorist saw a bigfoot crossing the same road in 2004.)In 2008 the witness and his nephew were driving some back roads north of the Sherman Pass area, looking for deer tracks.  It was October and there was snow on the ground, the top layer of which was very fresh, light and fluffy.  They soon came upon what they believe were bigfoot tracks.  He described the tracks as being about 16 inches in length, with a stride of 5 feet or more between steps.  He could discern evidence of toes within the tracks, but the snow conditions (very light, fluffy snow that fell back into the tracks) did not allow them to see crisp details.  The witness is confident the tracks were not caused by any other type of animal.  I asked him if they could have been caused by a bobcat or coyote bounding through the snow and he was adamant that was not the case.  He and his nephew followed the tracks on the roadway for almost a mile, at which point the tracks went down an embankment and into a creek.  They searched the nearby creek banks for further evidence of the tracks but found none, forcing them to conclude whatever made the tracks must have walked IN the creek for some distance. The witness told me, \"No human wearing snowshoes is going to do that.\"My personal research in this area lends credibility to this report.  I have talked to several people in this area who have reported unusual howls, woodknocks, and tracks. I've done a number of solo horsepacking trips and camping trips in this area and have had similar experiences.  Based on these experiences, I believe there is at least one sasquatch family group living in the remote forests between the towns of Kettle Falls and Republic.",
