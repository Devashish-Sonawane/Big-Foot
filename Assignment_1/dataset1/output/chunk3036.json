Graham foothills headed towards Safford traveling about 15 mph. The fog was so heavy I could bearly see. I flipped my brights on to try and see better but it only made it worse.  when i turned them off I saw a hairy man like creature run across the road. It had to be at least 7ft. tall. I couldn't get a good look at it beacuse it vanished into the fog.  I know for certain it wasn't a human.",

He was stunned as he stopped his vehicle and thought how close he came to hitting the animal.-Motion of the biped was described as a slow run with a slight hesitation as though it was startled and perhaps disoriented in the fog as it turned it's upper torso toward the oncoming lights. -The animal had matted looking dark brown hair longer than a bears fur.  Due to the thick fog and the short duration of the sighting he could not provide any more detail.-This location is fairly open with scattered mesquite trees and washes/rivers about 5 miles from Mt. Graham.-The witness wanted to return to find tracks in the snow from the night's storm but the snow melted during the day while he was at work.",
