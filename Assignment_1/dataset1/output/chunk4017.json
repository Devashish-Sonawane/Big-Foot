            "Observed.1  ": "\tTom Biscardi, 57, said he heard a rustling in the brush and looked up, expecting to see melting snow plopping from the treetops.  Instead, he described a \u0093blurry blackness\u0094 that rose from a squatting position about 100 yards away and took off through the woods. \u0093I said, Oh God, here it is again,\u0094 recalled Biscardi, who said this was his fifth sighting in 32 years of hunting.  \u0093I\u0092m yelling to the guys, \u0093Come on, get the cameras, and let\u0092s go!\u0094 To his dismay, Biscardi had left his tranquilizer gun and his wire-mesh grenade launcher at home.  He said he threw a stick at the creature hoping to antagonize it, but apparently the beast wasn\u0092t fazed and disappeared into the trees after a brief pursuit. \u0093It walked upright like a man,\u0094 said Biscardi, who issued a press release about the incident this week.  \u0093It wasn\u0092t a deer. It wasn\u0092t a bear. It was unbelievable.\u0094 That\u0092s exactly what the skeptics have said about past Bigfoot sightings. \tThere\u0092s a twist to this story that could fuel further, skepticism.  A pair of brothers from Burney, Lee and Jimmy Hickman, were among the discoverers of the tracks. They are grandsons of Ivan Marx, one of the more well known, and controversial Bigfoot hunters of decades past. Marx died five years ago, and many believe his stories were no more than tall tales.  Very tall tales, Bigfoot, after all, is supposedly up to 9 feet tall. Marx, a hunting guide whose family has lived in Burney for nearly 50 years, announced in 1970 that he had caught Bigfoot on film in Washington State.  He boldly stated that he would capture one live within a year. Six months later, the film was deemed a hoax.  A fellow Bigfoot hunter argued the alleged animal was a man dressed in fur. \tCritics continue to blast Marx on various Bigfoot Web sites.  But his widow, 79 year old, Peggy Marx, defends his name and says this later encounter was real. Peggy Marx said she went to view the tracks two weeks ago and was there when Biscardi yelled for the cameras. She and her grandsons didn\u0092t see the creature, Bigfoot four times in the past. \u0093Some believe, some don\u0092t\u0094 Peggy Marx said Friday \u0093They\u0092re entitled to their opinion.  You just let it fly by, you learn not to pay attention to people like that.\u0094 \tBiscardi, a former show producer in Las Vegas who lives in Redwood City, got swept up in Bigfoot fever after he saw the most famous footage of all, the 1967 Patterson film shot near Willow Creek in Trinity County. Since then, Biscardi claims to have seen a Bigfoot at Lassen Peak, and more recently, a white baby Bigfoot. Last year, he announced an \u0093expedition\u0094 to capture a Bigfoot.  News reports said he would seek up to $1 million in corporate sponsorships to pay for gear ranging from high tech global positioning equipment to deodorant and bug spray. Biscardi enlisted a public-relations firm to get out the word and said any findings would be \u0093offered for commercial sale, use and distribution and scientific study.\u0094 \tHow does he plan to catch this elusive prey? His tools in clued a \u0093grenade launcher,\u0094 which cast a net that would burst open and trap the Bigfoot.  Biscardi also once planned to drop a \u0093sleep bomb\u0094 on Bigfoot from an airplane. His expedition involves more than two dozen people searching all over the United States, Biscardi said, including lesser known Bigfoot hangouts such as Louisiana, Florida and Vermont. \tThe exact location of the Clover Mountain sighting was kept secret.  Biscardi did say it was about 5300 feet above sea level in an area still thawing out from winter snows. Few Bigfoot reports come out of the Burney area, but the rugged terrain is likely good habitat, said Bigfoot investigator and U.S. Forest Service archaeologist Kathy Moskowitz. The prints were said to be 15 inches long and up to 6 inches wide. The creature supposedly had a stride of greater than 5 feet. \u0093These have to be two of the most pristine prints I\u0092ve ever seen, and I\u0092ve been in this business a long time.\u0094 Biscardi said. \tMost possible Bigfoot encounters in the north state aren\u0092t sightings, but rather blood-curdling screams at night, nasty smells or strange footprints. \tThe Hickman brothers, who reported finding the latest prints, haven\u0092t yet seen a Bigfoot. But the seasonal timber fallers are certainly trying.  They spent much of Friday on their off-road vehicles, binoculars in hand; carrying on with the hunt their grandfather Ivan Marx began in 1951. \u0093Anytime the weather\u0092s clear, we\u0092re out there,\u0094 said Lee Hickman, 37.  \u0093That\u0092s all we do. \u0093I\u0092ve never seen the creature, but I want to see him.\u0094                            Bigfoot history Sixteen Bigfoot encounters in Shasta County   have been reported since the 1970s, according to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (www.bfro.net). \u00b7\t There were 20 reported encounters is Siskiyou County, 18 in Trinity County and four in Tehama County. A Redding man reported the region\u0092s first prints in 1958. A Redding woman claimed Bigfoot kidnapped her in 1976, a story refuted by law enforcement. The U.S. Forest Service considered Bigfoot legitimate enough to include the creature in a 1977 environmental impact statement for a logging project in Trinity County.
