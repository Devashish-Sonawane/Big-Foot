The screeching sounds it made matched those he's heard of a Sasquatch recorded on the Lummi reservation near Bellingham, he said. ",

            "Observed.1  ": "The Sasquatch also looked just like the other one he says he saw while working in the Olympics for the Nat'l Forest Service in 1995. It was kneeling by a creek when he and another worker came upon it, and it took one look at them and disappeared in two steps, he said. \"All you saw was a blur of of its legs,\" he said. His partner saw exactly the same thing, Mills said. When he reported his June sighting to the Suquamish Police Department, an officer told him he wasn't the only person to see a Sasquatch on the area lately, he said. He declined to give out the names of the others who have seen it, but offered to pass a message along. The other reported Sasquatch-seers did not respond to the request for an interview.  When Patrick Julian heard Mills' story, he headed straight to Indianola to see for himself. Julian, who lives in Port Orchard, is a volunteer field investigator with a Bothell group called Bigfoot Central. Many Bigfoot reports turn out to be bears, stumps or humans, he said. But he could tell Mills' experience had a ring of truth. \"David was very credible,\" Julian said. \"He sees bears back in the woods, he knows the difference between bears and Bigfoot.\" Plus, there was a footprint. The Sasquatch didn't leave much trace in the dry soil, but he happened to step in a muddy patch on his way uphill and leave on partial track, Julian said. The track was 7 inches wide, which would make the foot 15 to 16 inches long, he said.  Another Bigfoot track from Kitsap County is on display at the Bigfoot Central Museum. It was taken 3 miles from Lider Lake in the summer of 1984, said Bigfoot tracker Cliff Crook. Julian said he doesn't get many reports of sightings in the immediate area. He's heard about Sasquatch screams near Long Lake, and gotton one report of a Sasquatch near Gig Harbor. Most recently, a sighting Bigfoot Central classified as \"possible\" was reported near Discovery Bay this March, Crook said. Julian is hoping other people will contact him with reports of Kitsap County sightings. \"What I'm looking for is people who are afraid of ridicule and persecution by other people,\" he said. \"They're usually afraid to say something. I want to find out if there are people out around here who don't know who to contact or are afraid to come forward.\"  Lately, Julian has been spending weekends in Eatonville, where there's been a lot of Bigfoot activity, he said. He also drove to the Lower Hoh Indian Reservation on the Olympic Peninsula where a man reported finding Bigfoot tracks recently. Investigators there found 3 sets of tracks, from an alleged Sasquatch with 11-, 15-, or 17-inch feet. They were able to follow one set to a patch of matted grass where they believe one Bigfoot slept, Julian Said. He still came up shrot of his ultimate goal, seeing his first sasquatch. That's the downside of a well-publicized investigation like the Hoh tracks, where Seattle TV crews came in and ruined the peace and quiet a Sasquatch seeks, Julian said. \"That's usually what happens when all of sudden a bunch of people walk in,\" he said. For that reason, he's respecting the Suquamish Tribe's wishes and leaving the indianola site alone. Otherwise, he'd be camping there, searching for hair and droppings and hoping to attract a Sasquatch to his campfire. But the last thing he wants is to bag a Sasquatch trophy. \"We are on a peaceful pursuit,\" he said. \"We are not out to harm anything.\"  Rolf Johnson, the deer and elk manager with the Dept. of Fish & Wildlife, said the department occasionally gets reports of Bigfoot, although it has never had one for Kitsap County. The most recent one came in two years ago. A man brought in some alleged Bigfoot dung he found near Mt. Rainier, Johnson said. He passed it along to a Veterinarian, who analyzed the sample and found it inconclusive. When people report a Sasquatch to the Department, they usually want to see it protected, he said. \"I just tell them the Dept. of Fish & Wildlife has no jurisdiction,\" Johnson said. \"It's not classified as wildlife in this state.\"",
