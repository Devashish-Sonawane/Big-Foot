I was going to finish watching the Pagosa Basketball team play and go home. But a boxing match was on the same night and my best friend's (not the friend that saw it with me) brother-in-law was going to buy it on Pay per View, and his brother-in-law lives in the area of Cromo and Edith, Colorado.  There are always some crazy sightings of UFO's and Bigfoot sightings. I really didn't believe in these type of things until I saw one for myself.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this young man one morning at a Denny's restaurant, and have since talked to him on the phone on at least one occasion.  He is an avid outdoorsman and hunter, having been raised, as I recall, in the Pagosa Springs area though he no longer lives there.  I have no doubts whatsoever as to his credibility, and subsequently met and interviewed, at his suggestion, a former high school teacher who knows the witness well.  This teacher has also talked to one or more additional individuals who have had some kind of sighting or encounter in this Pagosa Springs area.When asked about the size of the creature, the witness stated that he believed it had to be at least eight feet tall, perhaps nine, as it smoothly crossed the county road in approximately one and one half strides.",
