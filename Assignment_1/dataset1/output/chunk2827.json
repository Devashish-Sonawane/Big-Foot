On the way back we missed a turn on the regular trail and were soon on a game trail.  We had traveled about a mile down this trail when it became almost impassable.  I looked down to the right and recognized that we had passed the family camp and could see the end of the State Campground.  We were at the far end of the campground and about 1/2 to 3/4 miles above it.  I decided to take a game trail that was very over grown down the mountian side to trek back to the camp.  It was about 3:00 pm and I was concerned that we would be caught on the mountain at dark.  With me were my wife 50, my son 7, and my daughter 11 at the time.",
