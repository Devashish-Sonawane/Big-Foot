            "Follow-Up Report": "The mother of the witness also submitted a report:My daughter and I were taking Reynolds Rd headed back to Interlochen from a friends cabin on S. Carmean Rd and the Betsie River. We came around a curve to an open field with woods several hundred feet off to the right. Up near the woods at our end of the field appeared to be a big rock, but it stood upright on two legs and faced us, sending chills up our spine. It was a very tall creature, 8 to 10 feet tall. It had, in proportion to a human, extra long arms. It was hairy all over from head to feet and didn\u0092t appear to have a neck. It\u0092s head and neck were the same width. It started to run in the same direction we were driving on very long legs and appeared to run in slow motion. Then two animals, German Shepherd dogs or wolves appeared on the left edge of the road and looked as though they were watching it. The creature appeared to momentarily turn and face the road almost to beckon to them and the dogs ran towards it. They all ran into the woods. My daughter and I were in shock and scared at the same time. We didn\u0092t say a word or speak to each other the rest of the way home, but when we got in the house we immediately looked at each other and both started to cry.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Both witnesses observed a dark gray or black creature approximately eight feet tall weighing 350 pounds.  The creature was seen in daylight at a distance between 200 and 250 feet.The witnesses saw a creature without a discernible neck or facial features.  The creature was described as 'beefy' or muscular and very hairy.The creature moved in an odd stance, canted forward, and in apparent slow-motion.  The creature was observed for approximately thirty to forty-five seconds.Also observed were a number of canines that acted in a cordial or subservient manner towards the creature.Both witnesses have been profoundly affected by their experience.After having spoken with both witnesses, on separate occasions, I find them to be truthful, cooperative, and credible.",
