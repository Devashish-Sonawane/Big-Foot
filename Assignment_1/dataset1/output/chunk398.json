He also recounted that the night before the hunting experience he was sleeping in his truck and woke up in the middle of the night feeling like someone was looking at him through his tinted windows on the truck's canopy. During the walk into the hunting location he and his partner could hear thumping or deep thudding sounds. When the two of them were in the blind he recalled that the environment went suddenly quiet to the point where his hunting partner dozed off. The silence was broken by the scream and the animal which Brian recalled moving through the 8' trees with a bipedal running sound. Based on his years of hunting experiences it did not sound like an Elk or Bear running. As the animal which ran from its position behind them screamed, the witness noticed black fur covering its back and body and heard the cracking of trees as it pushed them over in retreat.",

            "Observed": "I was fishing in northwest Barron county late September of 2011. I made a cast and followed my lure in flight when it hit the water I noticed movement beyond my lure.on  the side of the hill. I couldn't believe my eyes it was grey about seven or eight feet tall it was hard to judge the height because of the steepness of the hill. it was hanging on to one tree and grabbing another when it was coming down the hill. it froze in its tracks when it noticed me looking at him. He slowly pulled him self back up the hill, then he stood there for 2 seconds and looked at me; then he continued up the hill, never making a sound. I was about 20 yards away. I went home and rationalized it for a couple of days,before I told my friend about what I had seen,before I could describe it to him he told me what color it was. He said it was seen the same time the year before on the ice age trail, about a quarter mile from his house.",
