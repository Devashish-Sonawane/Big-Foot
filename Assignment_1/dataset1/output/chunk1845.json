It arrived there with a great deal of crashing and breaking down of trees.  I was looking to see what was coming when it stood up and looked at me.  It had greyish brown long hair, particularly over the face, wide set eyes, ears on the sides of the head, and a huge chest and shoulders.  It looked at me for maybe 1 minute, then went back down into the ravine.  Later that day it was making lots of sounds, like low grunts, my friend heard this as well.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I visited the sighting location on January 10th 2012.  The area of the sighting is typical of the Cuyahoga National Park, which encompasses 34,000 acres.  The area has a ravine which goes off to the south west and merges with a creek about a mile away.  On the site visit, I noted that the location that the witness saw the animal was on a game trail with a couple of other trails in the area and about ten feet from a water drainage creek.  Many fresh deer tracks were noted at this time. Several miles to the east is the Cuyahoga river, and there are also several smaller ponds between the property and the river.   There are a several small farms in the area, which produce locally grown produce in the summer months.  From measurements that were taken the animal was about eight feet tall with a shoulder span in the four to five foot range.  The witness also noted that when the animal ran away, that it ran with its head and shoulders sloped forward. Also that day vocalizations were heard on and off for about three hours, they consisted of grunts, and rocks being moved. ",
