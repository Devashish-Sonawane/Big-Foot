            "Follow-Up Report": "Jesse and his friend arrived about 8:30 pm at Little John Lake for a canoe trip. Even though there was still some daylight left, they decided to do some canoeing rather than setting up camp. They made their way across Little John Lake to a narrow, shallow channel which connects Little John Lake and John Lake, and continued onto John Lake. It was now about 10 pm. They were in the middle of the lake and about 150 yards from shore when a rock landed in the water very close to them. They shined their flashlights at the shore but didn't see anyone or anything, and the shore appeared to be desolate. Since it was after 10 pm they decided to make their way back to the car and call it a night. While in the rocky shallows between the lakes they hear a very loud noise, \"...like a cross between a gorilla and a duck.\"  The noises were very close, but whatever was making them remained just out of the range of their flashlights.  This went on for 10 mts. while they worked to free their canoe which had become grounded.  The lake and and virtually all wildlife became calm, \", like a dead calm.\" Jesse's friend is a hunter, and he had no idea what the noises were.  Once they got to the car they bunked down for the night. Jesse said that it was very difficult to sleep as it was eerie and he had the distinct sensation of being watched, and at one point he saw a large shadow standing very close to the car window, then move away. The two left the location the next morning. The Boundary Waters area includes more than a million acres featuring over 1200 canoe routes through over 1,000 portage-linked lakes and rivers and includes 16 hiking trails and at least 2,000 designated camping sites.",

            "Observed": "We were out shooting clay pigeons and plinking up on a logging road. We were on the east side of the divide heading towards Lost Lake if I recall. It was in June or July of 1985. We had pissed our dads off for some reason and they told us to get out of the back of their truck to walk. As the truck rounded the corner and the dust subsided, it happened. We heard the rustling of trees and shrubs about 10 yards downhill of us. Then the most guttural, loud, and high pitched yell erupted from the trees below. We hunt all of the time and have never heard anything like that. To this day we cannot pin it down to any known animal in this region. It wasn't an elk as it didn't bugle. It wasn't the cry of a mountain lion, and certainly wasn't a bear. The sheer decibel level of the sound indicated to me that it was a rather large animal. We looked at each other and ran to that truck about a mile away. We never looked back, we were too scared. An interesting thing happened about five months ago. I rented a bigfoot documentary which had a recording some campers had made in Washington State somewhere in the summer of 1971. Too my astonishment, the recording was a duplicate of the spine trembling cry that we had heard. My brother and friend couldn't believe it when I called them right away to let them listen. It was eerie. Let me know if you need more details.",
