            "Observed": "I lived in Las Animas county, Colorado, with my mother and step-father in a canyon called San Miguel which is located along the Raton Range on the Colorado/New Mexico border.  We lived in a very remote area.  (Behind Fisher's Peak near Trinidad, CO)  I used to have to get up real early to get to school.  It was daybreak and our dog was outside barking hysterically.  I had never heard her growl or act this way before or after this morning.  She was looking into the canyon.  I went to our kitchen window which faced the canyon.  I could see something running into the canyon.  It was on two legs, tall and covered in hair.  It didn't run like a man, it ran as if it was straddling a small rut, side to side.  I ran down the hall to my parents room to wake them up so they could see what I was seeing.  When they got to the window it was gone; however, I saw it one last time as it passed between bushes.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Gina on the phone and the following can be added from this interview. Gina was 14 years old at the time of this sighting and she would get up around five a.m. to get ready for school. On this particular morning her dog had been frantically barking outside. She stated the dog had never carried on like this before.  She saw through the kitchen window a large upright creature, dark brown in coloration from top to bottom running up the canyon on two legs and approximately 400' away. It was just getting light outside but she could see It swinging its arms and it had an unusual and prominent swaddling motion as it ran.  I questioned Gina if she thought this could have been a bear as this area has a substantial black bear population. She stated emphatically it was not. She had seen several bears in this area in nearly four years year of living there and this creature did not look at all like one.  It had ran the entire time on two legs and had wide shoulders. Until this time no one in the family had seen or heard anything unusual.  The Raton Mesa is rugged and covered in pine, fir, and pinyon pine forests and rises to 9186'.  The area this sighting took place in was a remote canyon, surrounded by private property with the nearest neighbor being  approximately one mile away, and with an apple orchard located across the road a short distance from the residence.",
