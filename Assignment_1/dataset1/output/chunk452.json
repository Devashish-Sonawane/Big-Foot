            "Follow-Up Report": "Investigator's notes, combined with notes from an editor who also spoke with this witness:I called and talked with RC tonight on July 28, 2006, and he went over his rendition of his and his friend's experience in the Big Tujunga Canyon area several miles above Sunland, back in 2002.  They were up there looking for a remote swimming area nick-named \"Monkey Canyon.\"  In Monkey Canyon there are, supposedly, ropes tied to branches of tall trees overhanging several large pools in the creek bed. The ropes allow people to swing out over the large pools, Tarzan style, and drop into the water -- hence the name \"Monkey Canyon\". They were trying to find Monkey Canyon when they picked a fairly arbitrary place to park and descend down into the canyon. He said it was a slightly trecherous descent.  Much of terrain in the upper San Gabriel Mountains is steep and trecherous. Many hikers have died here, usually by slipping and falling to their deaths.After they reached the creek bed they began to hear a very loud growl/scream that came from a small knoll that was about 30 yards away from their location.  They also heard what they thought was a loud banging sound that sounded like a large branch or tree hitting another tree. As that was happening they watched two trees with their tops moving, as if the trees were being shaken. They seemed like fairly large trees that were about 6 to 7 feet apart.  While all of this is going on, they both smelled a very pungent odor.  Hearing and seeing this, they decided to leave. He said the growling/screaming sounds would seem to stop as they would move away, but then as soon as they would stop the growls/screams would began again. This happened a few times on the way out.  As the witness said, they finally \"got the message.\" Whatever was making those sounds wanted them to keep moving. ",

I once knew a lady who had seen a white bigfoot in Discovery Bay, Jefferson County while checking on a foaling mare one night.  My husband and I heard tree knocking while cutting fire wood up the Twin River area in 2007. In August 2011 we went camping up the Sol Duc and smelled a terrible smell one night like rotting fish.  I had our boys move into our tent with us and in the middle of the night our puppy woke me up terrified, but would not make a sound.  His whole body was shaking and he moved to the very back of the tent and kept his attention fixed forward.  The smell was gone the next day.  There was also stones stacked up down by the river which resembeled the camp ground.  I cannot be sure a person did not stack the stones though.   Since looking at your sight and listening to the vocalizations, I am sure I have heard them before, but did not know what it was.  My brother knew a girl who found a footprint I beleive in the Sol Duc a few years ago.  She did not have a camera.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I communicated with the witness multiple times by phone and email and consider her to be trustworthy. The witness was 9 years old at the time, but due to the powerful impact of the experience she remembers the sighting like it was yesterday. The following details can be added:The creature was approximately 125 feet away when she saw it standing under the tree. Primarily its left side was visible as it faced south/southwest. Its torso was slightly turned toward her as it leaned forward with a slouched posture and it's arms hung straight down. After seeing it under the tree and running in the field, she described it as having a dark, wide face and a consistently dark brown or black color overall. Its body was slender, not bulky, with a very athletic build to its 7 ft. tall frame. It had body hair that was a uniform length of approximately 3 inches and no discernible neck. It ran on two legs the entire time, but the way it ran and moved was not like a person. Upon reaching the porch a short distance away, the witness looked again at the creature running in the field just in time to see it use its right hand to strongly and easily swat away her friend's springer spaniel dog. The dog went tumbling, but was unhurt and quickly returned to the house. Numerous reports indicate that dogs are generally afraid of sasquatch. This dog lived at the location and may have been instinctively reacting to protect it's human family when the children were frightened. The breed is known to be very protective and easily aggressive.Numerous reports of sasquatch encounters have come from the northern Olympic Peninsula surrounding the location of this sighting.Below is a recent satellite view of the sighting area:Below is a photo to show the terrain and give a general idea of the route the creature traveled: ",
