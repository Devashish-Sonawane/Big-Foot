            "Follow-Up Report": " I spoke with the witness by phone. The sighting occurred when the witness was 10 or 12 years old, he is not exactly sure of the year. At the time his grandfather was caretaker of a property which was kept locked at night. Certain people could pay a fee and use boats which were kept there. His grandfather would unlock the gates and check on the boats in the morning. Early one summer morning the witness accompanied his Grandfather. When they got out of the truck something stood up on the far side of the lake near the dam, about fifty yards away.The creature was taller than his Grandfather, who was over six feet; he estimated the height at six and a half to seven feet. In was covered in black hair which was matted on one side \"like it had been laying down\". The hair was relatively long, \"about like an Irish Setter\". The creature did not have much of a noticeable neck, no visible ears,  and most of the facial detail was obscured by the hair.  It had \"big hands\". \"It just stood there looking at us\".His grandfather said \"Don't worry about him boy, he won't bother nothing\" and turned the witness away toward the boats. \"When I turned around to look again it was gone.\"See also report Report #18278.",
