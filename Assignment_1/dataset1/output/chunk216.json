            "Observed": "My encounters with a Bigfoot creature began in October 2010.  One Saturday evening around 4:00 in late afternoon I was wiping windows in the den and saw this big black hairy head peeking around a storage shed in the back of the house.  This house was in the country and had farm crops all around it.  There were a line of evergreen type trees planted on the east, west, and north sides of the home.  The window I was cleaning faced north and the animal was past the tree barrier to the north inside the back yard.  I could not estimate any size as the head was towards the middle of the building about 5 feet from the ground in estimate.  When I stopped to stare, the head went back behind the shed.  I waited, nothing happened so I moved to another window to the left side and began wiping there. This time the same head peeked around the corner in the same way except I saw black fingers (long) holding onto the corner of the building just lower than the head.  Feeling spooked and quite alone, I thought maybe vacuuming would scare it away.  I did not always get good phone reception in the house.  After vacuuming I looked and saw nothing but still feeling uneasy, went ahead and called a friend to come over.  I never told my friend what I saw.  I had doubts and I wanted to be sure.",

She described the creature looking in her bedroom window as a large silhouette of an upper torso with lots of hair. Even after she installed blinds on her bedroom window, she could tell when the creature was trying to look in, because the light from the yard lamp would be blocked and the room would grow noticeably darker. Even though the bedroom window faced the paved road in the front of the house, a large evergreen tree was there for cover if traffic passed by.When she saw the creature between the garage and the house, it was cold, windy, and cloudy, but still in full daylight. She said the creature did not move when she spotted it, but she could see its long hair blow in the wind. The expression on its face was one of surprise. She drove away leaving it standing motionless. She moved out of this house the next month.I found the witness to be forthright and consistent in relating the details of her encounters.",
