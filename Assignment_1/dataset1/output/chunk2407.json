Whatever it was stood right up in front of the lens, so you can't see a body shot, but the picture shows brownish-reddish hair hanging down in front of the camera.

            "Follow-Up Report": "**Updated show the report is added back to Recent Additions**Upon receiving this report and the trail cam photo, I was quite compelled to get to the location to scout the area and search for more evidence. After multiple phone interviews, fellow BFRO investigator Dave BeVier and I followed up with an onsite interview. We quickly found out that they are avid deer hunters and their land is skirted with feed stations all around the edges of their soy bean field.They have at least three game cameras set-up during the summer to scout deer for the fall season. The husband mentioned that the property has always yielded a very large population of white-tailed deer and plenty of wild turkey. They typically checked the cameras on a weekly basis to see what's been feeding at the feeding stations. If the camera showed any photos taken, the memory card was removed and taken up to the house (roughly 300 yards away through the woods) to view the pictures on their computer. When they saw the one photo they were baffled on what was in the picture due to the length of the hair. They quickly went back out to the location and looked around. To their amazement, they found a series of four tracks coming from the woods that skirted the same game camera that caught the picture of the hairy, unknown something. The camera was set to take pictures in one minute intervals which would be the reason why the track maker wasn't photographed. During our field investigation, the tracks that we could still make out, measured close to 14 inches long and 7 inches wide at the ball of the foot and close to 5 inches at the heel. Lucky for us, the witness snapped a few photos of the tracks, making out obvious toe impressions and the typical Sasquatch shaped footprint. This is one of the photos taken by the property owners of one of the 14\" x 7\" x 5\" tracks:Once the print maker entered the soy bean field, we couldn't find where it reentered the wood line on the day of the investigation. The game camera that took the photo was approximately five feet off the ground. There was an obvious game trail that came to the one side of the camera, and entered the soy bean field where there was a food plot maintained on a regular basis. This picture from the game camera, the reason why the property owners checked the ground for tracks, appears to be long, fine reddish-brown hair. Judging by this photo, it appears that it could \"possibly\" be under the arm hair of some sort or a side shot of a possible torso. If the footprints weren't found in the same exact area it would be real hard to make any type of assumption on what could be in the photo. The property has a nice sized creek running through the heart of their woods which would explain the abundance of deer and other wildlife. We searched the property along the edge of the soy bean field and in and around the thick hardwood forest. The property owner did mention that this has been a strange year due to the fact that the coyote population seems to have gone way down in his particular area, and this was the first year his cameras haven't yielded a single coyote picture.There has been a multitude of sound reports coming from this specific area from Spring 2015 through the entire summer. Most locals in the area are quite convinced that something is living in the area of an unknown origin. I was also contacted from an alternate source of a sighting report from another local resident that took place in early August, pretty close to Nova, Ohio, only 15 minutes away from New London. Two men, while driving down the road, witnessed a Sasquatch crossing the road and jumping over a ditch. The witnesses wished to remain anonymous and has no knowledge of this New London report. We will continue to monitor the area. Here is a pic taken by the same game cam, same month, of a nice buck:This photo was taken of the game camera at its location, the game trail leading into the soybean field is directly behind Dave:",
