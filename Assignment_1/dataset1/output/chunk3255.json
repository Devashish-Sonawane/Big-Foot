            "Observed": "Two winters ago at around 9:20p.m. I was coming back from dropping off the person I was dating at the time. The conditions were sleet and ice and I shouldn't have even been driving, but there were news reports that we would be iced in within meer hours. I didn't want to be trapped with this person at my home so I ventured forth into the night. He lived approxiamately thirteen miles away. To make a long story short, on my way back into my subdivision ,which is VERY rural, I came around a curve in the road. I was moving quite slowly because of the horrible weather when I slowed down even more because I saw a large ball of hair about the size of a large deer on the side of the road. I had my bright lights on the animal when it stood up, took two big steps, went over onto it's knuckles and lunged into the woods. I screamed to my son \"Did you see that?!!!!!\" But he was sitting slouched down into the seat. I went to the house to get my father, his shotgun and his large truck. I made him drive back to where I had seen the- I will say animal. We drove all the way around the lake and around the entire subdivision in the sleet and ice because I just knew that he would see it too and I would have another witness. No animal. No witness. Just me. I was in tears. I was being told I'm stupid and all I saw was a deer or something. We were iced in for three days. I went back with someone else after the ice melted. THERE WAS ONE SINGLE SOLITARY FOOTPRINT. I SAW IT!!!!! I touched it!!!! I placed my own foot in it. Then I smashed the print unerneath my own.",
