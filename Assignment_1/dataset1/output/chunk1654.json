The time was around 10:00 AM.  There was very light traffic at this time.She first noticed the figure as it crossed over a four foot barrier fence that runs along side of the highway just inside the woodline.That is when she first noticed that it was walking on two legs like a human. It did not have any trouble stepping over the four foot high fence, and then crossed the four lane highway at a fast speed. It ran with a smooth, almost gliding movement.  It did not bob up and down when it ran.  It ran on two legs the whole time and was slightly hunched over as it ran. It was covered in black/brown fur and the head was set low on the shoulders. It first crossed the Southbound lanes, then the Northbound lanes, then stepped over the fence on that side and disappeared into a pine thicket.She could not give me a height estimate of the figure. She was not sure of the height and did not want to guess. She would only say that it seemed to be \"huge\".",
