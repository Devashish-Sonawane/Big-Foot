At 11:00 pm, when he first heard brush breaking, he thought it was a large animal such as an elk making crunching sounds as it walked. The knock was very clear and sounded like a bat hitting a telephone pole or tree. At around 3 am, he heard brush breaking and single wood knocks in two different locations. He thought one was maybe 150 yards away. He said, \"I thought about it too much, for fifteen minutes, and then left.\" He did not hear any vocalizations. The witness is not aware of any caves nearby, but there is a huge rimrock above on the steep mountain. This rest area is on the edge of Caribou National Forest. There is farm land on the west side of I-15. The witness does not know of any orchards, just different crops.The witness is an avid hunter and spends much time in the woods. Thirty years earlier, he heard two knocks early in the morning that sounded the same as in this report. I find him very credible. ",
