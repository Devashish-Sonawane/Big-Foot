I looked down at the road and when I looked back up I saw something that I will never forget. It was bigfoot. It was only about fifty yards away from me crossing the road, all of eight foot tall, long light brown hair. I ran into the house to get a camera could not find one. Me and my sister did find footprints the next day. I live close to the river on a farm,  a lot of woods. About five years ago there was a sighting about seven miles from where I live. There are people that just don't like to talk about it. I do know that they are out there.",
