Perfect for squirrel hunting, so off I went, not telling anyone where I was going (I had a number of different spots).  I headed for a small woodlot, maybe 10 acres in size, less than a mile from my house.  This woodlot is about 1/3 mile from the nearest road, surrounded by farmland with a small stream on the south side and with several fence rows attached.  It had a farmer\u0092s lane that went though it in a rough L shape, with a grass and dirt base and large enough to drive on.  Such woodlots are a fairly common feature of the southeastern Michigan farming landscape, if anything the woodlot was smaller than most.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Any close-up and long duration sighting is interesting on its own merit.  This case was of particular interest to me for that reason but also because, as a hunter myself, I also spent a great deal of time walking alone through the woods in my youth. This incident could have happened to me.The land around this sighting has changed in the intervening decades since this sighting occurred.  But even today you can see some areas of forested land connected by a substantial amount of farmland.  A brief look at the homes in the area show that those nearest the farms were settled right around 1900 but there was a dramatic build-up in the 1960\u0092s and again right after this incident happened.  It is reasonable to believe that there were substantially more interconnected areas of forest land, cut through with many rivers leading into Lake Erie, in the 1980\u0092s.I spoke with the witness and I have had a great deal of contact with him. I decided to provide the reader with questions that I asked this witness.  I asked him to write down his responses so that I had a record of the account in his words.  The questions were mine but the answers are in his words.  Could you describe your outdoor experience?  (Camping, hunting experience, etc).I was very familiar with the location of the encounter, and the entire area within a mile or so radius of my home.  I hunted or wandered the area almost daily, starting with air rifle at around 10 years of age and .22 at 12.  I ran a trap line in the fall and winter (primarily for muskrat) starting at 13.  I likely would have been passing the exact point of encounter weekly or so for a couple years prior to the sighting.  If real game was not in season I would be varmint hunting for birds or ground hogs, so I was out and about year-round.  The encounter occurred shortly after I turned 15. How well did you know the area?I guess most of this is covered above, again I was on home turf and due to the amount of time I spent wandering this area I was extremely intimate with the surroundings.  Since I was out year round I knew all the seasonal cycles; migrations of birds, crop plantings/harvests, fish spawns, and so on.  When I was not hunting I would look for reptiles and amphibians and kept a journal on the stats and locations of my findings.  I knew every trail and every shortcut, and kept good relations with the farmers so I could have rein to wander freely in the area (shooting groundhogs, pest birds, and trapping muskrats helped in that!)I would like to know a general coloration of the figure.  Could you compare it to a known animal?This is hard; it was just a classic reddish brown.  I cannot come up with an animal with the exact same color... This likely will be of no use, but if you take a muskrat, which is quite brown, and blow on the fur so the guard hairs flow away, you will notice a reddish color. It was kind of like that.  However, since Sasquatch are known to you and me, I would say it was a classic reddish brown bigfoot as has been reported before ;) How long do you think the entire encounter lasted?This is a surprisingly difficult question for me to answer.  I will have to guess this.  There were a couple staring at each other phases that I have no idea how long that went on, although it probably was not that long it just seemed like it!  Overall, I would have to guess at a 2-3 minute range, from just walking through the steps that happened... Have you been back there since?  I avoided the woodlot this occurred at the rest of that year and the next.  Then I cautiously returned.  So, likely returned to the encounter spot after about 18 months or so.  I kind of compartmentalized the sighting to that exact woodlot, and as long as I avoided it for a while I was OK going to my other woodlots and the other parts of my home range.  I have heard of other witnesses never returning to the field.  I think this had to do with the nature of my encounter, in which by the end of it there was something of a resolution of sorts, if you leave me be I'll leave you be kind of thing.  It de-escalated, although it terrified me it was less terrifying at the end.  A more typical encounter is seconds with the creature quickly disappearing into the trees- that sort of thing might be harder to deal with.  Was there anything else that made you feel non-threatened? The entire demeanor was non-aggressive.  I was terrified due to this creature\u0092s scale and the fact that mythology was now real, but there was nothing else.  No snarls, no crouching, no sudden moves, no change in expression that I could see (as I noted the entire face was hair covered) during the stare offs.  Then during the eating at the end there was something of a more relaxed tone to the face, as it glanced between me and the bush.  But the berry eating was the biggest factor, making it clear to me that this was its main concern, and as long as that was not messed with there would be no trouble. Thank you very much again for your interest, it is good to talk about this...",
