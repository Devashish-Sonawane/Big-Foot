Anyways, we weren't very busy at work, so my uncle is walkin around and looks out the back door, he stops, and yells to me, HEY COME HERE!  So i run over to where he's standing and see this big black hairy thing running down the hill. It definatly wasn't a bear, a bear can't run down a hill on 2 feet.  This thing was very big and hairy like an ape, and it moved very very fast.",

He thought the whole sighting was about ten seconds.He told me that he saw a really big, black hairy creature running on two legs and moving very fast. The hair was about two to three inches long. It seemed to him to be scared and running from a property nearby and back into the woods.The property is located in a pretty remote location, but there are two businesses in the area. The location has a lot of forest and hills with a creek running behind it. There are abandoned mines a couple hundred yards from the location.The witness is a hunter and has seen bears in the wild before.His uncle said he saw one moving through a thicket near the same location years before.",
