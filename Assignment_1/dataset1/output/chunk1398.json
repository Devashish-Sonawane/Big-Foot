            "Observed": "My name is Todd Davis.   Myself and a freind \"Brian J.\" went camping at Wilson Island State Park. This park is connected to Desoto Bend National Wildlife Refuge in Iowa. Well here is my account of what happened. It was aproximately 2:55 am when I was awakened by the sound of footsteps in the dry leaves. It circled my tent then stopped directly behind my head. Being half awake I assumed it was my friend Brian getting up to go to the bathroom in the bushes. But then I heard the sound of Brian unzipping his tent and so I realized it wasn' Brian. When I jumped up to go outside of my tent, what ever it was standing behind my tent took off, plowing through the trees heading to the Missouri River, which was about 300 meters from our camp site. Anyway when we both climbed out of our tents, we were afraid, because Brian thought I was walking around his tent trying to scare him. When we realized we were both inside our tents at the same time it gave us a very spooky feeling. I guess what bothered us the most was that we were the only people in the campground. We pondered the possibility of it being a hunter, but why would a hunter be out at 2:55am in a state park? Well, neither one of us saw anything but I have never felt like that before. The whole night we both felt like we were being watched.",

Other species really do not fit... especially when combined with both the vocalizations and their  volume.Then add  the sounds of heavy footsteps just outside the tents which was followed by a loud crashing of the brush on its exit.  Also obvious was that  he was completely convinced  that something large visited him and his friend that night. And, he described how nervewracking such an experience was.  Todd  also mentioned that the vocalizations matched several sound files available on the websites.",

Thin brambles at tree line which is about 6-8 feet in from road, then the terrain is sparse undergrowth, with obvious (to me) deer/animal trails but no human made trail. South side, where I parked, has a bank upward about 7 feet (varies) and there is a line of planted pines. Walking up the road about 50 feet and looking around the south side, I did notice a big lay of fallen timber, several old 8-16 inch trunks together that would possibly make a hiding place if needed. This area in general is full of little gully creeks and feeder streams. Despite the presence of homes, I do not find it inconceivable that we may at least have some intermittent squatch traffic around here.",
