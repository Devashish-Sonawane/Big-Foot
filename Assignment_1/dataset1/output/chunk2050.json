I used a spotlight and checked out the surrounding area and found nothing.  So, just figured a tree fell, no big deal.  Approximately 10 minutes later a LARGE crash from, what I assume to be, a tree was heard further down the road.  I again used  my spotlight and saw nothing.  We sat on the porch for a bit longer and heard rustling off in the woods.  We decided to go inside.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After communicating with the witness, the following details can be added to their report:The vocal started out as a low rumble that morphed into a whoop. It wasn't overly loud, no louder than a typical conversational volume.After the vocal, the first tree crash sounded like a smaller tree approximately 50 yards away. Examination of the area with a spotlight did not reveal anything notable.About 10 minutes later, a second louder crash was heard, possibly a large tree, that sounded to be over 100 yards away.This region of Virginia has produced an increasing number of reports recently. The witness' neighborhood is heavily forested and contains homes distributed across a wide area with plenty of cover in between the houses. It is plentiful in the resources a sasquatch could take advantage of while passing through, including a healthy deer population and garbage cans from which food scraps may be scavenged.",

We heard this extremely loud roar like scream that we had never heard before. We were country kids who grew up in the country and knew all the animals in the area & heard every sound they all make except for this one.  It was so loud you could feel it in your stomach.  My friend went in the window, I flew in through the sun-roof shouting for my sister to take off.  About 300 yards up the hill we looked back & there stood in the middle of the road an extremely tall, brownish-red hair covered creature, standing on two feet like a man.  It had walked out of the shade & was standing in the evening sun.  You could tell that it had the body of a large man except this reddish brown hair covered it's body.  His arms were down to it's side and appeared longer than ours.  Area now has been developed. Never seen it since, not that we ever went looking for it.  Would love to see it again though.",
