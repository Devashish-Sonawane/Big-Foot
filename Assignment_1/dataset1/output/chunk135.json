            "Observed": "I and my girlfriend were riding in my Jeep on Route 140 from New Bedford to Freetown tonight (July 14, 2009) and at about 11:00 my girlfriend seen this large brown hair covered \"man\" standing up from a crouched position on the side of the two lane highway. She lets out a scream prompting me to look at the creature standing there. He made fluid movements like a man and had an almost ape-like quality. We couldn't see his face but upon returning to the area we saw the \"man\" there was nothing. After calling 911 and telling them that someone was running in the median of the highway they told us that they had similar reports of what we saw on the stretch of highway between exit 7 (Braley rd.) and exit 8 (Chase Rd.) They then told me that they were sending state troopers to investigate.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness (driver) was phone interviewed approximately 3 weeks after submitting the report. The girlfriend did not want to talk about the incident since the memory of it still upset her. A 30 minute inquiry and site visit to the specific area of the sighting provided some additional details summarized below.The witness was driving northbound and traveling approximately 70 mph in the left/passing lane closest to the divided highway median.  The depressed grass median between Exits 7 and 8 of the north and southbound lanes is approximately 40 yards wide.  The witness stated that the animal had a wide midsection covered in brown body hair, darker brown, long arms and was approximately 7 to 8 feet tall based on the height of a highway mile marker that was just adjacent to where the animal was standing.  The witness also stated that the animal had a long chiseled jaw.  The total duration of the sighting was approximately 3 seconds from the time the witness turned his head and first saw the animal until his car passed the creature. As his car passed the animal which was standing only 3-4 feet to the left of the hood of his Jeep, the witness reported having a scared sensation and noted that the animal had one arm down and the other arm up in a bent position as if getting ready to cross the northbound lane.  The witness exited the highway approximately 2 miles north of the sighting and traveled back southbound to the point of the sighting but did not see anything unusual. Although the placement of the 911 call by the witness was not confirmed, the witness reported that he subsequently had an informal discussion of the sighting with a friend who is a Massachusetts State Trooper whom was on call that night.  The police officer told him that the local dispatcher did receive several related calls around the same time that evening, and he and several other troopers responded to the call and arrested several teenagers who were in the general area. However, upon receiving this information, the witness remained steadfast in his belief that what he saw was not a teenager playing a prank.The location of this sighting is immediately west of the Bolton Cedar Swamp, recognized as an important conservation land tract comprised of wetlands, ponds, bogs and acidic swamps vegetated with Atlantic White Cedar, pitch pine and scrub oak. The sighting occurred approximately 14 miles north of Report #25364 and approximately 3 miles southeast of the eastern border of the Freetown-Fall River State Forest.  This state forest marks the western point of the \u0091Bridgewater Triangle\u0092, an area of approximately 200 square miles that has had numerous reports of paranormal activity dating as far back 350 years when Native American Tribes and colonists co-inhabited the area.",

First report was on August 1, 1990 at a mobile home near Eldon, Oklahoma which is east of Tahlequah at the junction of highways 62 and 51. Woman living in the mobile home reported to Cherokee County Sheriff's Deparment that she heard noises and noticed a bad smell. She then observed a creature approximately 10 feet tall and about 400 pounds. Deputy Joe Weavel investigated the reports and found impressions big enough to place both his feet in. Two days later, an 8 year old girl and her mother described a similar creature going through a trash pile near their house. Their dog chased it but returned with it's tail between it's legs. The creature was described as 8 feet tall with dark brown frizzy hair and similar to a bear except that it was described as walking upright. Oklahoma Wildlife Department district chief, Joe Adair said he had received several calls regarding the animal and believed it to be a bear. He said he \"nothing to base that on\" and that it was unusual for a bear to walk on it's hind legs for very long. Similar reports came from this area in the early 70's.",
