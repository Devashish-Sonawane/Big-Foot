            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness and his friend by phone.They were hiking at sunset and one half to one mile from camp, when about thirty yards away they saw an upright figure looking at them from behind a large tree. The witness described it as \"gorilla-like\" (i.e. a primate, not a bear). The tree did not cover the whole body. It swayed a little for 3 to 4 seconds and then ran the other direction on two legs. The witnesses saw it for about 200 feet and then it blended into the darkness. Due to the fading light they could not see facial details but the head was wide and the eyes were somewhat glowing red. The eyes were estimated about six inches apart. Both friends agreed it was at least seven feet tall. It was stocky with long, heavy arms that swung out as it ran. Both witnesses said it moved very fast with long strides. The shoulders were three to four feet wide, shaggy hair longer than a bear and dark brown. The friend thought the figure wanted to watch them but then the hikers saw it. The hikers were disoriented. They ran for ten to fifteen minutes in the wrong direction, away from camp. They eventually made their way back to camp using the light from a cell phone. They did not hear any vocalizations nor smell any foul odor. They did not go back to look for tracks. The next morning around 7:00 am they heard from camp two times the sound of a falling tree crashing. They did not look for the downed trees.There were a few other people in the campground but the friends did not mention this to them. The family of the witness have camped at this area for many years around Thanksgiving and there have been no other encounters. This is near a developed area and at first may not seem likely for an encounter but the Payette National Forest is very near, one half mile away.

I have hesitated about reporting this encounter because my best friend of 40 years doesn\u0092t believe me.  But I assure you, this really happened.  I am so excited about the encounter that we are returning to the area with our horses in a few weeks to do some investigating of our own and to trail ride some more since it rained on us all weekend this last time.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After talking to Kerri and her husband at length on the phone, and later with her father, I found them all to  be very forthright about the encounter. And very willing to answer all my questions. The encounter was still very much vivid in their minds. I talked to Kerri and her husband first. Then later I called EH her father after getting off the phone with Kerri. Her father was quite a bit skeptical but offered up that he really can not explain what happened but that it most definitely did. Here are some additional things my investigation brought to light. They were staying at the equestrian camp south of the lake. These camp sites are set up with corrals in each camp so your horses are pretty much right in camp with you. It is a really nice set up, I know first hand as I have been to these camp sites on many occasions doing some research in the area. There are many trails designed for horse riding that go for miles back into the hills and mountains.  It was a cloudy, rainy weekend with no real wind to speak of.Many times the horses would not want to go down certain trails and their horses are all older, well broke horses that never hesitate to go where they try to lead. On some trails they had to turn around and some they were able to coax them along. Each time the horses hesitated to go down a trail there was a \"rank\" smell in the area. EH also mentioned hearing a loud blowing sound on one trail. When I inquired if this blowing sound could have been a deer blowing or snorting at them he said he has heard many deer do that and this was not a deer. He likened it to a plane sound and that he served as a jet mechanic in the USAF and whatever made the blowing sound did it with some force. Later back at the camp while gathering fire wood Kerri's husband seen something black and large move very quickly for a split second into deeper cover which unsettled him. When I asked more about it he really had nothing more to add as it was something that happened so quickly he could not say what he thought it was. I asked about the \"coon dog/coyote sounds and they were not sure that's what they were, and later her mother mentioned as they discussed the sounds that she thought she heard a \"faint blood curdling scream\" mixed in with the other howls. Lastly we talked about the trees shaking. I asked if it could have been wind, but they quickly shot that down and said it was definitely not wind. Only the two tree tops were shaking and all the other trees were still. Kerri once again mentioned it looked as though they were shaking in a circular motion. Once this happened EH said it might be best if they all turned in for the night. I asked EH what he thought it could have been and said he had no explanation of what it could have been, only that it happened and he had not seen anything like it. Nothing of note was found the next day nor did anything else happen. I have researched in the Cedar lake area and have had a few class B encounters of my own including tree shakes.  There is a long history of sightings and reports in the general area as well.",
