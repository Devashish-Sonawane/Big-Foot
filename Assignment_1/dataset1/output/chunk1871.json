I also heard dogs barking above me, higher up the ridge.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "A few investigators have spoken with this witness. He is credible. The case is not a question of credibility though (credibility in the sense of honesty). This case would be a question of interpretation.  Sound-only cases and the interpretations of witnesses are inherently difficult to evaluate and judge, because various animals and birds make various hair-raising sounds. Sasquatches make very distinct and powerful sounds though -- sounds that leave a lasting impression on those who hear them.  It is more likely for people to hear sasquatches than see them. This is true for any forest animal that makes loud vocalizations, especially nocturnal animals.  The BFRO has, in the past, debated whether to post sound-only reports. We have more stringent standards for sound-only reports, but we do not hold them back completely.  Sounds are too important as clues to ignore or suppress, due to fear of interpretive fallibility of witnesses.  Some of the best evidence gathered in the past was a direct result of sound-only reports.",
