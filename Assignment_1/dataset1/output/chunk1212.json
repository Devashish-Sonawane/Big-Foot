            "Observed": "On 6-94 we visited Yellowstone National Park and rented a cabin near Teton Lake. My wife and two sons were with me. We left one morning just after dawn to visit the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and see the sights. A short ways up the road I looked to the right and there was a big open flat field with a body of water running through it about nine foot wide. Tall green grass about waist high was growing --it was a beautiful sight. About sixty yards out or so I saw a tall, dark, hairy figure standing close to the water. It stood seven foot or so tall with it's back to us and it's head turned to the left. Its features were massive and very powerful. It was no bear because it heard our van and saw us and took off walking like a man. Its stride was long with it's arms swinging as it walked. My entire family all saw exactly the same thing. The light visibility was quite good. I told all family members to keep their eyes on this creature and to look at nothing else. We finally drove our car through some trees on the road and could no longer see the creature.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness age 51, elaborated on the creature's physical characteristics during an interview.The man said as he stared at the creature, he resolved more details. \"It had almost human facial features, a big thick neck, a massive skull, big huge arms like a gorilla, a big back, kind of dented in -- I don't know how else to explain it -- massive legs, a big butt. Its head was cocked to left, and it was staring out across the water, not moving.''He stressed that the animal could not have been either a bear or fisherman.\"I got a good look at that thing and it was massive. It was no bear. It was no fisherman. This thing was hairy from head to toe.  There is absolutely no way that's a fisherman. My first thought was it was a grizzly because of the size and coloration.\" (The witness said he has bear hunted before.) \"I've seen pictures of sasquatch on TV. This looked like that, although it might have been even bigger around.''\"This thing is real, and it is a big ape. It's got arms on him like a tree trunk.'' ",
