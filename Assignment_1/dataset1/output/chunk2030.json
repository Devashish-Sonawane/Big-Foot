I was with my parents and their friends and we were on this back road somewhere and something was wrong with the friends' truck so I remember that we stopped and they were looking at the truck and something caught my eye. It was a very tall person with thicker and longer than usual arms and legs; I could only see the silhouette of him and he seemed to be in a hurry and he was crossing the road in front of where we had stopped. I didn't say anything at the time, I wasn't frightned, just totally amazed by what I just saw. And still to this day I know what I saw and wasn't just seeing things as a child.  So I KNOW this was either a bigfoot or someone dressed up like one. And it wasn't anyone in my party because I remember looking at them all to see if they had just seen what I had, but they were all occupied with something else.",

But after we saw it the second time we knew it was no bear. We came back the next morning after the second sighting and we met another family that said they had seen the same thing about the same time. They said it came within five feet of their car. I never did ask what the face of the creature looked like.",
