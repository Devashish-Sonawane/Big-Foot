We observed and exclaimed, \"that looks like an ape sitting on the side of the road. The animal was about three feet high in a sitting, crouched position. We were going south from left to right. We saw its left arm shoulder to elbow, left leg hip to knee, lower leg obscured. The head was larger with a sagital crest. Lantern shaped jaw that protruded slightly forward. The nose looked wide. And it had a protruding eyebrow like a Neanderthal. Its ears were covered in black hair tight to the head. No visible neck. Still going left to right, we can clearly see, shiny black hair. The animal leaned forward head going low, could see top of both black haired ears. Our distance at this point is between 22 to 25 feet. The animal extends its right arm from the shoulder parallel to the ground and drops some trash from its hands. The arm had black hair all the way to the knuckles. The arm was to long to be human. When it dropped the trash, a thumb and four fingers were clearly visible.The animal moved its right arm back in front of its torso, ninety degrees of angle. Not a bear. It did this action twice. Still going left to right, the right arm from shoulder to elbow is visible, below the right arm, between right arm and right leg, right leg visible from top of buttocks to hip to knee, partially covered by green plastic garbage bag. We estimate its overall height to be between five foot six inches to six feet tall. We said moma-squatch would not leave baby that close to the road. As we lost sight of it we knew it was a juvenile Bigfoot.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I called the witness on June 27, 2016 to follow-up on this report. This witness is a 63-year-old lifelong outdoorsman. He is very familiar with all the animals that are native to the Pacific Northwest. He has hunted and harvested deer, elk, and bear. He is very qualified to identify the animals that he sees in the woods. In this witness\u0092s case, he is additionally experienced with identifying sasquatches, as he has sighting experiences that started when he was 15 years old. I asked him to tell me what transpired. He re-told the account of his sighting. His report narrative is very complete. I found this witness to have an eye for detail as he described what he had seen. Further, with this sighting, it is only about two miles from my home. His girlfriend said that she looked into the forest behind where the creature was and was able to see and adult standing there watching. The sighting was along one of the public roads that pass through Joint Base Lewis-McChord (formerly Fort Lewis). He mentioned that he knew what it was at first sight because he had seen them several times during his lifetime. This revelation made me want to hear more, as I felt there was much more that we could learn from his other encounters with sasquatches.A couple of weeks later, July 16, 2016, my wife and I met this witness at a local restaurant. I had my notebook out and started to take notes as he began to tell of the first time he had an encounter. He was 15 years old at the time. As he told of the account, I became so interested in just listening that I stopped taking notes, and just listened. He told of five different sightings that he has had over the years. I knew the place where his first sighting occurred, as my family has camped near there several times, and I have hiked the same trails along the stream where it happened. Later, I invited he and his girlfriend over to my home so that he could tell me the whole account of his sightings while I recorded them. Here are accounts of three of those past sightings:He was fishing early one morning not far from the Killen Creek campground. There were sounds of birds and wildlife, when suddenly it got very quiet. He heard what sounded like a person whistle twice to get his attention. He looked around, and didn\u0092t see anything. Then, he heard what sounded like someone hitting a log with a rock. Thump. He moved a little to get a better view, but couldn\u0092t see anybody, so he kept fishing. Then a shower of stones and gravel hit the water right in front of him. He said to himself, \u0093Someone\u0092s throwing rocks at me.\u0094  He looked around and was not able to see what was throwing things at him. Then, he saw a rock about half the size of a bowling ball come sailing in an arc and land in the middle of the creek. He saw the arm that threw it, and knew then where the rock thrower was. He saw it behind a large dead standing tree snag. He could see both shoulders, one on each side of the tree. He said it was so big it would make the old time professional wrestler, Haystack Calhoun, look small.  He could see it looking at him, peeking around the tree. Then it stepped out along side of the tree. His first thought was, \u0093Who is this big, naked pervert watching me?\u0094 Then it dawned on him that it wasn\u0092t a person, it had to be a sasquatch. He said that it was obviously a male. The face was human looking, brown eyes, brown and black hair, hair on most of face, square jaw, chin whiskers, small ears on the side of its head, sloping forehead, brow ridges, a flat nose with big nostrils, and a cone shaped head. He could see the left arm hanging down almost to its knees, with the right arm still wrapped around the tree. The witness stood up and turned towards it, and as he did that, it made a quick inhale-exhale sound, which the witness did back at it. It then turned its whole body to the right and began to walk away. He said that he could see all the muscles move as it moved, its arm swing, and a three-foot-wide butt, and four-foot-wide shoulders. It was 8 \u00bd to 9 feet tall. It walked about 50 yards away, and turned its whole body to the left and looked at him one more time, and then walked off into the woods. The witness said to himself, \u0093That has to be a sasquatch.\u0094, as there was nothing else that it could be. The second sighting was at Tule Lake in south Pierce County. This is almost the exact location of BFRO report 29025. Report #29025 He was 18 years old. He was going duck hunting, so he took his rubber raft out to what they call the \u0093beaver house\u0094 out in the middle of the lake. He had been hunting all morning, and it was now around 10:00AM. He looked back towards the landing where people put in their boats as some ducks were flying there. He noticed a large, brown colored head going through the cattails. It looked like it was floating along above the cattails. Then it dawned on him that those cattails were 7-8 feet high, and this creature was a full head higher. He said to himself, \u0093That\u0092s not a person.\u0094 He continued to watch it walk along, sometime disappearing, and sometimes visible enough to see an arm. Ducks would flush as it walked through the cattails. His attention was momentarily diverted to some ducks that were going to fly over. Then when he looked back, at the end of the cattails, he saw this massive brown animal down on all fours drinking water. The back legs looked like human legs, but they were pulled clear up under the armpits.  He thought, \u0093There are no bears around here that are that big.\u0094 He took his shotgun, and fired a shot up into the air. As soon as he shot, the creature stood smoothly up and turned its body to look at him. The bank that was behind it was 4 \u00bd feet high, he knew because he had been over there. I asked how far away it was, and he said 150 yards. The bank came up to its hips. He could see clearly that it was a male. It was looking right at him. Although he was not moving, he believes that it could see him. Then, it turned its whole body to the right, so that its left side was facing him. It put its hand on top of the bank, and with its left foot, stepped right up on top of the bank. With that, the witness thought, \u0093A person can\u0092t make that step.\u0094 He said that he could see the calf muscles, tendons, and butt as it stepped straight up to the top of the bank. He watched it walk away towards some Christmas Tree size fir trees which were about 6-9 feet tall.  He observed that most of the trees were under its chin, but some were higher. Then, a pickup truck was approaching on the road that parallels the lake. The creature turned, spotted the pickup truck, and dropped straight down. He could see it in a crouching position. After the pickup passed, it stood back up, looked in the direction that the truck had gone, and then walk out of sight into the woods. The witness said, \u0093I have got to see this.\u0094, so he got into his raft and paddled over to the bank. He couldn\u0092t see footprints in the muddy water, but on top of the bank he could see a massive hand-print. The hand print was twice the size of his hand. He could also see impressions where it stepped with the left foot and then the right foot. He paddled back to the landing, got in his car, and drove around to about where he thought it would have crossed the dirt road. He found an 18-24 inch place that looked like someone had taken a dust mop and slapped it down on the road. He found a foot print on the side of the road, one in the middle, and one on the other side. The mud from its feet fell off the foot at each step. He judged that it was every bit of nine feet tall.The next sighting was his most cherished and significant sighting. He commented that he felt he was blessed to be able to have this sighting. It was 1972 or 1973.  He was about 21 years old. There were four of them camping up by Lake Cushman. Two were studying to be ministers. The other was his girlfriend who he would become his first wife. The first night, they heard screaming like a woman screaming, and then another high-pitched scream and that was followed by another scream-howl that was deeper in tone. They were trying to figure out what it was. They were discussing what animal it might be. Then a woman came up and said that she thought that she had seen an ape up there earlier in the day. After further discussion, he decided that he would get up early in the morning and go up the old road that went up the hill alongside the lake and try to see what was there. There was a gulch up there, with a stream running down it. So, he got up early in the morning and walked up that old road. As he walked quietly up the road to where the gulch was, he heard mumbling from below him, as if someone was talking. He stood very still. He could tell that there were two, as he could hear branch breaking, foot-steps and the talking back and forth. He said that he could hear \u0093H\u0094 sounds. He paralleled them slowly, watching down the hill, trying to see them. As the brush thinned-out, he could see two blond heads. One was small, and one was big. He thought, \u0093Blond? The only thing that color of blond is a grizzly and there are no grizzlies in this area.\u0094 As they moved, when a branch broke they would be still. He knew that this was no human, as a human always takes that next step, which is a dead give-away. When they stopped, he would stop. He could still hear the mumbling. When he got to a place where the dark shadows of the trees were across the road ahead of him, he saw a huge black form cross the road and disappear. He said to himself, \u0093What was that?\u0094 He kept creeping up the road, and could still hear the mumbling. When he got to a place where there were three trees and a stump along the road, he sat down, looking over the edge of the bank. He could see there were huckleberry bushes below him. The slope was about a 10%. He sat there very still, and noticed a motion in the brush below him about 15 feet away. He shifted only his eyes towards it, and saw two large brown eyes looking at him. They were about eight to ten inches apart. It had brown skin on its nose, and a couple of wrinkles. He saw the eyes flick over and look at him, but he sat very still. He saw the blond hair, and it was massive, on all fours, foraging for berries. He just sat there watching. Then he sees the long, blond, left arm reach out and grab a berry bush branch and strip the berries of with its mouth. The fingers were black. He realized that those were not gloves. He sat watching for a while, and as the sun got a little higher he brought his hands up to shield his eyes so he could still see it. When he did that, he noticed 15 feet away was this little \u0093doll-like\u0094 face looking at him and holding its hands above its eyes just like he was doing. The little one was mimicking him. Eventually, the little one put its head back down. The witness said out loud to it in a friendly tone of voice, \u0093I see you.\u0094 It popped its head back up to look at him, and it looked and looked at him. Then the adult looked over towards him too. He avoided making direct eye-contact. Most of the time they were out of sight down low in the brush, but he could see the heads from time to time. He noticed that they would very soon reach a place where the brush opened-up, so he would be able to cut them off and see them clearly. So, he slowly crept up and over to his right. When he kneeled back down looking over the edge, he suddenly heard to his right, \u0093Whuh!\u0094 Bam! Snap!, as a six to eight-inch diameter tree broke and was slammed to the ground. He looked that way to see another huge black thing about eight feet tall walking up the hill away from him. He stood up to get a better look. As he did that, out of the corner of his eye to the left, he saw the blond one take about ten steps down the hill. It stopped, quartering towards him. He could see a 7 \u00bd foot tall sasquatch with large breasts, blond, black hands and black hair in genital area looking at him. He said that she would put Dolly Parton to shame. He said to himself, \u0093This is a female sasquatch.\u0094 Then, he asked himself, \u0093Where is the little one?\u0094, so he looked down, and it was still right close by. He said that it turned towards the female with its arms outstretched to its sides and ran down the hillside. It was about four feet tall. It ran right into a stump, and vaulted over it, and then ran down and hid behind its mom. It then peeked out and looked at him, so he said, \u0093I see you!\u0094 in a friendly and playful tone. It then looked up at its mom, who made a little vocalization towards it, and then they both turned away and walked off down the hill. So, he walked back to camp. The people there asked him, \u0093Well, did you see anything?\u0094. He said, \u0093Yes, but you wouldn\u0092t believe me if I told you.\u0094I asked the witness about the sounds that they made. Telling of this encounter, he had made reference to \u0093H\u0094 sounds that he heard, so I wanted to cover this subject in more detail. I asked if he heard the word \u0093hic\u0094, as that word had been heard and recorded many times down at Dr. Matthew Johnsons Southern Oregon Habituation Area. It appeared to mean something like, \u0093Uh-huh\u0094 as when a human is indicating that they understand something someone else is saying. I was curious if they used the same word here. The witness said that it was something like \u0093hic\u0094 or \u0093hiss\u0094 and some others that to him were almost like words, but they were garbled sounds and he couldn\u0092t make out what it was. It was obviously to him the mom and baby talking to each other.I asked him how long he watched them. He replied that it was a good ten minutes. He said that he was sure that the mother knew all the time that he was sitting there watching and knew what he was.This witness has had several other encounters since then, while hunting mostly. He spends a lot of time in the forest, both hunting and fishing. He also has a personality type that I have seen in other people who have multiple sightings. He is kind, calm, and unafraid. He presents no threat. They seem to be able to sense those qualities in individuals.",
