The moose put his head down as he went into the brush. I was taking pictures through my spotting scope. I was whistling to try to get the moose to stop so I could get a good picture. My whistles were returned by something. 5 whistles. I know it wasn't the moose that whistled back at me. There was something in that brush patch. I could see eyes in the brush patch. I got a couple pictures but they are fairly grainy pictures.",

He saw a moose with the right antler only about 125 yards away and wanted to take some pictures through his spotting scope on twelve power. He whistled to see if the moose would stop. Right after, five high pitched whistles, one right after another came in response. As an experienced moose hunter, he was sure the moose was not the source. Here is one of the photos that he took of the moose:As the moose approached the trees, the witness thought it acted strange. It put its head down as if to make something move away. The moose continued up the hill and the witness saw in the spotting scope what looked like brown eyes. He did not see a head or movement in the trees. He tried to get pictures but they did not show anything significant. Here are the photos (second one has a circle) showing the area where he thought were eyes:  He was unsure how long he saw the eyes. He also had a feeling of something behind him. He did not detect any foul odor. ",
