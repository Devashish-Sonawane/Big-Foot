            "Follow-Up Report": "I went and personally visited with this witness.  She is a bright, engaging, and a sincere 19 year old college student.  She had gone out on the back deck and smelled a \"wet dog\", so she turned looking for her dogs when she saw the creature 30 yards away under a dusk-til-dawn security light.  The creature immediately took off at a fast pace. What struck her for the several seconds that she watched it was how massive it was, arms that were about mid-thigh in length, and how it swung it's arms as it walked. She lives in an area where there are many bears, and is certain that it was not a bear, and that it was bipedal. It is possible that the creature may have been interested in the rabbits that are raised in pens in the back yard. The area the site is located is rural, mountainous, with large valleys and rolling fields.  It is covered with old mines, caves, and large swampy tracts surrounding a river that runs through the area.  There is a large deer and cattle population in the area.  There is a large number of silage collections in the immediate area which could serve as a food source in colder weather. Another point that I believe that lends credence to this report is that word got out to a local television station who wanted to come do a story and the family said \"no\". This family desires no attention from the event.",
