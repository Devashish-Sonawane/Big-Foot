            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was interviewed by phone first, and then in person. He seemed honest and was believable as he told of his experiences with animals he believes to be bigfoot. The incident in which the witness saw the \"huge\" bipedal animal cross the road in front of his car was especially compelling. Additional details learned about that incident:- The animal seemed to have no neck, or it was very short and positioned low and forward on the animal's shoulders.- The animal seemed to \"kick up its heels\" as it walked. When I asked for a clarification on this point the witness described a high lift of the trailing lower leg and foot. It is worth noting that the creature in the Patterson/Gimlin film also shows a very high lift on its trailing lower leg and foot.- The animal did not turn its head to look at the man's approaching car, so he did not see its face or eyes.- The animal was dark colored, had a flattish nose not as protuberant as a human's, it swung its arms as it walked, it had a very thick chest, and its knees seem to propel the animal along as though they had \"springs in them.\"The witness showed me a track cast he'd made near  Aurora, MN at the end of May. It was indistinct and did not show individual toes but its shape did suggest a large (about 13 inches long) and very wide bare human-like foot.",
