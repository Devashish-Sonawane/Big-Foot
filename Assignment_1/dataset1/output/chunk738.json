            "Observed": "Camped at Jackass Meadow just below Florence Lake.  I was tired from a long day of fishing and driving to Lake Edison, so I ate and fished a little more and retired for the evening.  It was a full moon out and everything was really calm for a campground.  I went to bed in my tent fairly early and woke up several times during the evening.  Every thing was quiet and I got up to store my food in the bearboxes around camp.  I didn't hear anything or see any thing when I was awake.  I went back to bed and nodded off.  I awoke again from my sleep to a noise that I had never heard in the mountains.  It was late, and everyone to my knowledge was asleep.  The noise was coming from the east of the campground i'd say approx. 1/2 a mile to a mile.  I would say that it sounded the same as someone blowing through a conch shell mixed with and large mammal of some sorts.  I heard the noise two times after I awoke in five second intervals, right after one another, and then silence.  It was fairly loud and I knew that it was off in the distance because there was no other noise in the woods.  I have been camping/hiking/and mountaineering all over the West Coast and I have never heard anything like that sound.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone on 7/26/05. The following details can be added to the report:\u0095 The witness awoke several times during the night, but is usually a deep and sound sleeper. He heard the vocalizations after one of the awakenings. \u0095 The witness is an Eagle Scout, and has extensive experience in the mountains.\u0095 The two vocalizations lasted about three to five seconds each, with a pause of the same duration separating them.\u0095 The vocalizations changed in pitch over their duration. It started at a lower pitch, raising the pitch slightly, and then went down again before tapering off.\u0095 The witness said the calls had the same tone and pitch as the Ohio Howl, as heard on the BFRO website.
