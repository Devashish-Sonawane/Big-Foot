            "Also Noticed": "Two things to note of interest now was after seeing the bigfoot was at the top of the grove just below the top of the hill was a deer kill. It had some of the hide and dried flesh on it's bones and was probably killed a few weeks prior. Secondly that night at camp after dinner, I kind of brought up the subject of the show (Finding Bigfoot) to my hunting party to gauge their opinion on bigfoot and none of them believed in bigfoot. Two of the guys actually made fun of the squatch hunters. One of the guys let out a howl (in a mocking / joking, manner) and no more than a minute or two passed when we heard cracking sounds of timber then a huge tree by our camp come crashing down. I didn't put two and two together but after reading up on other sightings in Alpine County I learned of sasquatches pushing over trees to intimidate people and scare people away. The deer kill and tree falling was what I learned about bigfoot after researching it. Before that day I never gave bigfoot much thought and frankly didn't care if it did or didn't exist. Well now I know there are here, and it is a creature that needs to be protected and respected. The only way we can pass laws to do so is prove that they do exist.",

            "Observed": "Three of us went on a deer hunt that morning. We had a hunter at the top of the hill and he went up there in the dark before sunrise. At dawn my uncle and I went up the hill together parting ways half way up. There were two other hunters not in our party camped by us about 200 yards away at the base of the mountain. We did not know them or their plans.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and have the following details to add:- As he stated, he estimated the height to be 8 feet based on the branches of a tree that was next to the subject that he examined after the sighting. He described the color as dark brown or black but was not certain because of the lighting conditions in which the subject was backlit. It was tall and lean \u0093like an NBA player\u0094 but different in some ways. The arm was extremely long compared with a human\u0092s arm and the body was not bulky and thick like the subject in the Patterson-Gimlin film. - The bigfoot was facing uphill with its right leg bent and poised as someone would be getting ready to run a foot race. The right arm was extended down to the knee and the hand was evident with palm facing back and fingers curled to form a semi-circle. He noted the palm was not square like ours but larger by two times in a rectangular shape. They locked eyes and at that moment the creature bolted up the hill taking one large step and disappearing into the woods with amazing speed. The sighting lasted approximately 2 seconds.- The motion he observed was beyond human capability. The subject took one long, quick step landing on its left foot and was gone in a flash. He said it disappeared uphill into the forest in a blur of speed noting that it covered the distance faster than any human could.- This witness has hunted since he was a young boy and is an experienced outdoorsman.  His teacher and wrestling coach from school is our mutual friend who has an interest in bigfoot but the witness never really thought about it until this morning. Regarding the subject of bigfoot, he stated that he was not convinced they existed but did not give the subject much thought.  He did not relate the sighting to the rest of his hunting party because he did not know what they would think. We discussed his actions to seek out a hypnotist in order to recall details of his sighting. Upon returning to home, he was in a state of mixed emotions. He is a very good observer of the natural world and noted quite a few details of the subject during this brief sighting. He stated that he was blown away but what he saw but in denial. \u0093I knew exactly what I saw but couldn\u0092t believe it.\u0094  This led him to seek an appointment with a hypnotist.I found the witness to be sincere and very detailed in his recounting of the hunting trip and his chance encounter with a bigfoot that Sunday morning, September 23, 2012.Google Earth screen capture with labels associated with this hunter's sighting.  This should give you an idea of the terrain and where everything described in the narrative took place.",

It was not a deer or elk as it was running fast and heavy through the water. The ducks and heron in the water flew off and then everything was dead silent.  When we turned the boat around, to go back to shore on the other side of the lake, I looked back into the inlet where we heard the running. I could make out something very big on two feet standing in the shadows of the trees. It was standing up and it was swaying from side to side. I tried to watch it for a while before my friend made us go back.",
