            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness directly over the phone, some nine months after the incident.  She recounted the particulars of the event clearly and accurately in accordance with the details of her initial report.  I found the witness to be genuine in her discussing the incident, and believe her to be quite credible.The incident began at approximately 4:00 PM in July of 2004, when her dogs began barking excitedly from inside the house.  The witness recalls that she was talking to her sister-in-law on the phone as this began.  The dogs ran through the kitchen to exit the house to the backyard via the dog door.  However, upon reaching the dog door, the dogs both stopped suddenly and the normally agressive, larger dog began to whine.  The witness considered this very abnormal for this particular dog.  Out of curiosity, the witness stepped outside to see what might be affecting her dogs in this manner.  It was a bright sunny afternoon.  After scanning the area, the witness describes something catching her eye.  Upon returning her gaze to that location, she then saw an animal, that she could only compare to an orangutan, at approximately 200-300 yards away.  It was standing on two legs, but hunched over, as if trying to remain hidden, slightly behind a tree.  The animal was swaying from left to right as if to see around the tree, seemingly curious about the witness.  She described the animal as completely covered in hair the color of red pine needles.  The witness also described the 'style' of hair as that of a golden retreiver; wavy and flowing.  She estimated the height of the animal at seven to eight feet tall, but could not estimate accurately because the animal was maintaining a hunched posture.  (Later that day, the witness asked her husband, who is six feet tall, to stand in that position.  She claimed the animal, while hunched over, was easily taller than her husband.)  She also described the mass of the animal as very thick.  The witness described the eyes as an amber color and they were deep set in the face, with a forward brow.  She claimed the head was very large and round.  (After the incident, she searched the internet for explanations for this event, and found the BFRO site.  She claims the animal she saw strongly resembles the Gigantopithecus model displayed in a photograph on the website.)  The witness also mentioned that there was not hair around the eyes, nor on the brow of the face.  The incident continued while the witness stayed on the phone with her sister-in-law.  She did not mention anything about what was happening to this person.  The witness was  stunned by what she was seeing, and most likely was not listening much to the other end of the phone.  This particular sighting lasted approximately five to six minutes.  At no time did the witness experience any sense of fear, nor did she notice any unusual odors.  At this point, the witness walked to the front of the house to check on the children who were subsequently playing in an inflatable swimming pool.  After checking the children, the witness returned to the back yard and found the animal had departed.  After getting off the phone with her sister-in-law, the witness immediately called her husband to discuss the experience.  He returned to the home shortly thereafter and they both went to the tree from which the animal was standing behind.  It was obvious, based upon the flattened grass and knapweed, that something large had been standing in that exact location.  In the nine months that have passed since this event, the witness and her family have had no other similar incidents to report.Note:  When asked about any unusual sounds in the area, the witness did describe one such event.  She described a \"scream\" they heard in the spring of 2004.  It sounded \"garbled\", and reminded her of a young mountain lion screaming.  However, the sound emanated from a significant distance, the capacity of which is not normally suggestive of a mountain lion.  ",

In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness for nearly 45 minutes. She is very sincere and credible. Additional information gathered during the conversation : The time of day was dusk but still light enough to see color and detail. She says the animal was walking down the river bank approximately 25 yards from the campsite. It did not seem to notice the slowly gathering crowd until a few of them began to shine flashlights in its direction. It was brown in color and the hair was 5\"-6\" in length. She could not make out the sex of the animal. The eyes had a reflective shine to them but she could not make out whites of the eyes or a color. No one yelled at the animal or attempted to disturb it. At first it seemed intrigued by them but after about 2-3 minutes it became spooked and turned to run into the woods that lined the river banks. She said it showed great strength in that it easily pushed aside good sized trees to make its escape and that they could plot its path through the woods by watching the movements of the trees. The silhouette of the animal was seen again as it came into a clearing, and then went out of view. There were no vocalizations during the observation. The witness is female and from the Apache Indian Reservation (Jicarilla) in northern New Mexico. She is a now 21 year-old, reserve woodland firefighter.We'll found out if she is willing to host a blog in order to take questions directly. We'd like some recommendations on the best, free, blogging site, that is both easy to use, and has a posting system she can fully moderate.Regarding ther eyewitnesses: According to the witness, they came from all over. Tracking them down is possible, but they may get in touch with us on their own before that.  If you were one of the other eyewitnesses to this incident during the Del Loma Fire of September, 2003, please contact us via the Comments form -- see the link to the Comments form at the top of the sighting report form.
