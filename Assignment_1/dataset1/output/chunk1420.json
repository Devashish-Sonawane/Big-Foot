            "Observed": "A male friend and I left a local nightclub to go sit quietly by the lake. We had both had a couple of beers in a 5 hour period, but this was around midnight-12:30 am on Saturday night, Sunday morning. Neither of us were drunk, or tipsy at that time. I loved nature, and always spent as much time as possible in the outdoors. It was a beautiful night, with a full moon and we decided to go to Lake Hamiliton, about a 13 minute drive on the highway from our location. We were in a truck, and took the access road and parked so we were facing the lake. Surrounding the lake is very thick woods, and this particular area was for fishing and not used very much. We got into the back of the truck, and sat on a blanket, enjoying the peace and quiet. We heard the normal sounds, an owl, a branch creak, etc but nothing out of the ordinary. The moon was extremely bright, and it was easy to see about 2/3 of the lake shore. Around 1am or so, I noticed a dark shape to my right. My friend was on my left, and I motioned to him to be quiet. I made the shhh sound. At first we couldnt identify species or size, because it went in and our of visual field. The creature seemed to be walking around the lake, sticking close to the woods and forest. There is a small stretch, about 100 yards where they have made access for fishing, and the creature was almost to that point, which would put him straight across from us, about 75 feet away. We both saw it at the same moment, and looked at each other, wide eyed and open mouthed and then looked back to the creature. It was too far off to see tiny details of the face, but close enough to note the following; it was substanially larger than even a big man. It had to be at least 8 feet, it appeared to be covered in fur or hair, and it had walked upright the entire time we watched it. I am familiar and have seen MANY bears in the wild and this was NOT a bear! It's posture was upright, yes a bit stooped. It had long arms, long like a humans, but not overly long, I would say its arms reached about mid thigh. It had a flattened face, and big rather dense bone on the arms and legs. It resembled NOTHING I, nor my friend had ever seen before. I grabbed his arm, and as I did, the creature turned, and startled, seemingly as if spotting us for the first time. He seemed to waiver on what to do.. as if he wasnt sure if he should receed or move forward. At the moment he began walking in our direction, towards the truck we both literally jumped up off the truck bed, and into the cab of the truck! I looked through my window, as he was starting the truck and advised him it was still \"walking\" towards us.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to CC over the phone and she had these details to add--She and her companion decided to park next to Lake Hamilton in a very secluded area to sit on the tailgate of his truck. It was approx. 1230am with a full moon, clear skies and the landscape was brightly lit.-After a half of an hour or so, CC and her companion began hearing noises, what she describes as male cats fighting, coming from the distance. But they were not alarmed at that point. Very soon afterwards they saw a tall, bipedal creature come out of the wood-line. It appeared to be walking the shoreline, looking towards the lake, seemingly oblivious to them. It slowly wandered closer to them for about two minutes, still looking at the lake, then when it got to the point that the truck and the lake were on either side of it, it stopped and turned towards them. At this point it was approximately 80-feet away from them.-According to CC, she didn\u0092t know what a bigfoot was at the time. Her first reaction was that of disbelief because she couldn\u0092t understand what she was seeing. What she saw was a creature that was covered in \u0091smooth and flowing\u0092 evenly length, brownish-black, or reddish-brown hair. It stood well over eight feet tall and was approximately 300lbs or more. It appeared to her to be male because its shoulders were wide, yet sloping, very muscular, and its hips were leaner in proportion to its shoulders. Its arms were longer in proportion to a man\u0092s arms and its legs were long and slightly bowed. The head sat squarely on its shoulders and its head was \u0091big\u0092 and oval in shape. It didn\u0092t appear to have any ears. The nose, when seen when it was in a side view, was described as \u0091flat\u0092 and not protruding, nor was its chin, and it had a heavy brow with large, dark eyes that were difficult to make out because its face was in shadow when it was looking straight at them. The hands had definite fingers with hair seen on the backs of the hands. She described its gait as more \u0091human-like\u0092 than anything except that when it took a step the legs swung out slightly at the knees, rotating at the hip. Overall, CC stated that it was \u0091sturdy, muscular and compact\u0092 and on two feet the entire time. From what CC described its stride was very long with one of its steps equaling about three to four human steps.-According to CC, in the two minutes or so that it took before the creature noticed them and stopped to turn towards them, its behavior and actions were calm and assured, as if it had been to this spot before. Then, after standing still and silent for another minute or so, observing them, it began to slowly approach the vehicle. This is when CC and her companion really began to become frightened and took action. They both ran and climbed into the cab of the truck and while her companion started the motor and began to drive off, CC looked out of the open window of the truck and saw that it was closing in on them rapidly. They sped away and soon lost sight of it. They never heard it utter a sound nor did they smell any unusual odors.-In retrospect, CC is adamant that what she saw was \u0091not a bear\u0092, \u0091not a wolf\u0092, \u0091not a person\u0092, and \u0091not a gorilla\u0092. At the time she couldn\u0092t explain what she saw but to her it was \u0091an experience that she\u0092ll never forget\u0092. In speaking to her I found CC to be honest, forthright and sincere while relating the details of her encounter. The companion she was with has not been in communication with her for many years and she does not know how to contact him.",

            "Observed": "This happened around 2014 in the Thickety Creek community of Montgomery County, south of the county seat of Troy. A friend at church asked me if I could come down and check his creek for gold. He knew I liked to do some gold panning as a hobby. We never settled on a day or time, I just told him I would come by one day when I got a chance. I ended up getting off work early one day and decided to run down and wash some rocks. So, I parked at his gate and grabbed my backpack at gear and walked about 200 yards from the road. To my left is the creek with about 4ft banks and a steep mountain to my right. I walked down looking for a place to easily get down into the creek without lots of brush. This area is well known for huge Timber Rattlers.",

As described in his initial report, his intent that day was to do some gold panning on a friends property. This property is in a very remote area of the Uwharrie National Forest and this parcel he was in was about 400 acres. This is adjacent to the Uwharrie Game lands and its extremely plentiful with wildlife and dense forest.  Of the two rocks thrown at him, the second larger one he saw flying through the tree cover and it landed with a hard thud. This is the point when \"fight or flight\" kicked in, to which of course he chose flight, but under cover of his 9mm pistol.  He quickly departed for his vehicle extremely shaken and took him a moment to gather his wits and try to interpret what just happened. This area has several similar reports, and warrants additional investigation.",
