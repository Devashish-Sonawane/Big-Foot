            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness and visiting the location of the incident, the following details can be added to his report:He was at the Bear Heaven campground on a night when no one else was camped there.He was sleeping in the cab of his truck, and had not put up a tent or built a fire in his camp site.At about 3 a.m. he heard a loud double whoop. He believes the vocalizer was there in the campground, possibly no more than 20 yards away, but he could not see it. After a short pause, he heard the vocalizer make a second double whoop. And in the distance he could hear another vocalizer faintly, making a similar double whoop.The knocks he mentioned were heard in the area at an earlier time, and not part of his experience in the campground. He didn't pay the knocks much attention at the time. In late August the witness returned with his son to the area, and at about 10:30 p.m. in the evening he heard several distant moaning vocals. He described them as very similar to the moan howls he's heard on the internet.Also in August I visited the area and walked the roads near Bear Heaven campground. The camp is set high on a mountain overlooking the head waters of the Otter Creek Wilderness area. The surrounding forest is mostly old growth timber with a thick understory of mountain laurel. A generous number of large sand stone boulders abound in the area and provide dramatic topographic relief. The Otter Creek wilderness contains over 20,000 acres of undeveloped forest, and the surrounding area would provide ample forage, water and refuge for a sasquatch clan.",
