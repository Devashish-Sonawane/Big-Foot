            "Follow-Up Report": "Twice I spoke with the witness, Nevan, and his brother Nick, now 12 and 14 respectively.  The parents were unavailable for interview.  I spoke with the boys separately and neither had any difficulty recalling details of the event.They came from Minnesota to vacation with their cousins who live in Colorado Springs.  The sighting occurred at the Crow Gulch Picnic Ground on FS 334, Pike's Peak Toll Road.  Nevan was up on a rock outcrop looking down on his father who was taking a picture of him from below.  This is the view from the spot where Nevan stood: I queried Nevan about the size and shape of the animal, especially trying to elicit from him what is *different* from a bear, that is, why he's confident it wasn't a bear that he saw.  This is an excerpt from our conversation:NH: \"It looked pretty big.\"KS: \"Big like a horse?  Big like Hulk Hogan?  Or big like your dad?  Was it big and thick or big and skinny?\"NH: \"It was big and thick, like Hulk Hogan.  It was bigger than a black bear.\"KS: \"Did you see arms?  Legs?  Did it have shoulders or knees?\"NH: \"I saw it from kind of above it.  I didn't see its legs, but the shoulders weren't on its back like a bear's are.  The shoulders didn't move on its back as it ran like a bear's do.\"KS: \"What did it move like?  Was it bouncy or smooth?  Fast or slow?\"NH: \"It moved smooth and fast.  It didn't bounce up and down like a bear running.  I saw it for 3 seconds, looked at my dad telling him to look, and when I looked back it was gone.\"KS: \"Where did it come from?  Where did it go?  Why do you think it was running there?\"NH: \"I never thought about why it was there.  That's a good question.  I don't know where it came from and then it was just gone.\"The grass the animal moved through is taller than it appears in the photograph.  Most is around 16\" tall with much of it reaching 2 1/2'.  Coupled with the witness' elevated position, I'm confident this explains why he didn't see the animal's legs or feet.  I inspected the site with this specific question in mind.In addition to trees and grass, as described in the report, there is also more dense moist-site vegetation following the draw north, upslope, toward the location of Report 1359 1- 2 miles distant.  In the opposite direction, the draw meets Cascade Creek and its riparian character, which continues upstream toward the location of Report 819 at its headwaters 5-6 miles distant.Beyond topology, there is no indication that the same animal was involved in the three encounters.  It's interesting, though, that the Bigfoot Crossing sign on the road near Nevan's sighting is actually where an animal would cross to move between the locations of reports 1359 and 819 if it were traveling along the creek.",
