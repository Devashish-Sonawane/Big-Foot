            "Observed": "I was riding my 4 wheeler about 11 am when I came over a hill by my house on some gas lines. I saw a harry creature standing about 7 1/2 to 8 ft tall staring back at me. It scared me so I reved up the motor and turned the atv around looking back at the creature as I topped the hill I came to a stop. As I watched the animal it seemed to be very calm as it turned and steped off into the woods as if wasn't a bit courious of me being there. That was the first encounter I had with this creature. One of the other encounters I had was this year.  Me and a friend from my church went to my land and found ourselves being chased off the back porch of my house  by a very large animal about 1:30 in the morning.  I'm sure it was the same animal I'd seen years before. I have had two more run ins with this creature no doubt the animal is in this area.",

The area in which the sighting occurred is now primarily used by the family for hunting, no one resides at the house. The area holds plenty of wildlife, food plots and creek bottoms.  Witness stated that the creature was about 50 to 75 yards away. The approximate height of the animal was around 7 1/2 - 8 feet tall, weighting well over 400 + lbs, with black coarse hair.  The sighting lasted a few minutes and then the creature continued into the woodline. There was no detail to add about the porch incident or the neighbor being chased home.  The creature made a lot of noise, they did not actually see the creature during these incidents.",
