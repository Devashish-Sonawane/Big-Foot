            "Observed.1  ": "One of them describes a run-in with a Bigfoot that happened in July of this year. It occurred in Wilson County, which is located outside of Nashville. The county seat is Lebanon and the largest town is Mount Juliet. \u0093Yesterday, I, my dad, my son, and his friend went up to our farm in Wilson County to do some bush-hogging and prepare our deer stands for the upcoming season,\u0094 reads the report on the Web site. \u0093The kids asked if they could walk the logging road to see if they could see any deer or turkeys while me and my dad bush-hogged the fields.\u0094 After about 20 minutes of working in the fields, the father sees his son and his son\u0092s friend, both of whom are 12 years old, running towards the tractor and out of breath. The boy said to his father, \u0093Dad, I don\u0092t care if you believe me or not but what we just saw...I never want to see again!\u0094 According to their story, the boy and the girl were walking down an old logging road when the boy started hearing the sound of loud crashes in front of them. The boy said he stopped and felt \u0093very uneasy\u0094 about going any further. He told his friend that he wasn\u0092t going any farther and she could continue if she wanted. The girl walked around the bend of the road. In no time, she came back walking very fast to the boy. The girl reported she saw \u0093this thing\u0094 looking at her from behind a tree, swaying left to right, as if to see what she was. The girl, who is also a hunter, did not want to show any fear to the creature or make any sudden movements. She simply turned and walked as fast as she could back to her friend. She told him, \u0093There is something huge and black standing around the corner.\u0094 The boy started walking with her and sure enough, he too saw the creature. He reported that it was between 7 to 8 feet tall and had blackish-brown fur. The boy noticed that this upright hairy creature had huge muscles showing through the fur. He also noticed its broad shoulders. At that moment, the boy and the girl started walking away as fast as they could. After going a short distance, they both felt compelled to look back, and found that the creature had followed them and was now only 10 yards away standing near a cedar tree. They kept going until they reached the boy\u0092s father who was still bush-hogging in the field. \u0093I eventually got in my truck and drove to the spot/area they said this all happened,\u0094 reads the father\u0092s report. \u0093The woods were a \u0091dead quiet.\u0092 No tracks were found, I did not smell any foul odor, as I have heard this animal has.\u0094 At around the same time, a storm was approaching so they all decided to leave the place. But the brief sighting left a profound impression on the boy and the girl.  \u0093What makes me believe even more is that my son LOVES hunting and that farm, but now says he is not coming up unless he has protection (gun) and will not walk the place alone,\u0094 reads the father\u0092s report. \u0093Whatever this was or whatever happened to them has changed them. The friend, which said she doesn\u0092t believe in Bigfoot, now is a firm believer.\u0094 Three days after the sighting, an investigator from the BFRO followed up on the report and met with the boy and the girl. \u0093(The father) was completely convinced of what his son and his son\u0092s friend saw and experienced, and after speaking with both of the eyewitnesses in depth, I have to concur,\u0094 reads the investigator\u0092s comments. \u0093They were both excellent witnesses who noticed a great amount of detail\u0085The witnesses are only 12 years old, a boy and a girl, but both of them are hunters, and have spent large amounts of time in the outdoors. I found both of them to be very mature for their age, intelligent and very cautious with their answers. I spoke to the witnesses separately and their responses matched exactly with no deviation.\u0094 Perhaps, you too have had a weird encounter while waking through the woods. If you have seen or heard a Bigfoot, you can post your story on the BFRO\u0092s site. It can be found at www.bfro.net.

It literally had us shaking in our boots and roused our curiosity. It sounded as though whatever it was was less than a half-mile away. We took off through the trees to see if we could see anything. We of course were armed to the teeth and could have taken anything out. We both swore we could see some type of figure, but then figured we were seeing things. But deep down in the first place we were thinking Bigfoot. I don't know, but all these years I've wanted to go back and really find whatever it was. ",
