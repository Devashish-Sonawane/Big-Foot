We had just started to eat when one of the kids saw what at first we thought was a black bear across a ravine in small meadow about a 1/2 mile or so away by the forest line. It was just sitting there swaying back and forth. We watched this thing for about four or five min. when it stood up that's when we found out that it was no bear. It was very big at least 7ft or more tall and it walked kind of stooped over. And it went into the woods which was at least 15 yards to its right in three or four big steps. No bear can do that! it was a clear summer day and we saw it very well. I was born in Washington and had heard of Sasquatch before. I've seen the P/G film and what I saw looked & moved very much the same.",
