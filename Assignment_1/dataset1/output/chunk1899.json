            "Follow-Up Report": "Investigator Steve Nystrom and I met the witness at the location.   She explained that she often observed the local wildlife while driving late hours to and from work which included coyotes, wolves and bears. She knew this animal could only be a bigfoot. It was about 100 ft. from her vehicle when it crossed.  It did not hesitate and it did not look toward her. Steve stood at the guardrail, in comparison height, she estimated at 7 ft., and on the thin side.We followed the route it may have continued on which was only about 1/4 of a mile before we met Lake Superior and a nature trail.  We found different varieties of berry bushes, acorns and chestnuts. Deer sign was seen everywhere, including the remains of a deer on the beach.  Large rock outcroppings and cliffs are all along this stretch of Lake Superior. On the other side of the street where the bigfoot came from is Wetmore Pond with old-growth forest, rugged rock outcroppings and a unique bog habitat.  Also known as a deer wintering area.",
