It was hard to be sure what I was hearing because of the rain noise on the tent trailer roof. I stopped going that far back because of this incident.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed Thomas (last name withheld for privacy) and he seemed to be very credible.  He knows the area well and has camped there several times.  I visited the area that he said his experience was and it is next to a creek with ridges on either side.  The area is somewhat isolated and heavily forested.  I found Thomas to be honest and seemed to be very upset when talking about how he had pretended to sleep with his gun in his hand.  In the morning he heard logging trucks go by and felt a bit safer. He waited till it was light and packed up and left the area.  This is an area that historically has had sasquatch reports although Thomas was unaware of this. Received from witness Brian Hornaday on December 22, 2019.\"A friend and I were regulars to Jones creek campground area. We went up on a weekday planning on staying a couple nights. There is a 3 way fork about 1/4 mile from the day use bridge spot  If you go straight and go about 3 or 4 miles there is a little bridge, and to the left a Cul De sac type camping area where there are 3 big camping spaces spread out and one in the middle. There was a stream that went along one side, but it was about a hundred feet from the sites. On the other side of the stream there is a steep wooded hill up until you get to the highway, with no place for people to just be hanging out. Its all thick brush and trees so anything on the other side of the river, is certainly going to be an animal. On top of that, there was no one camping there at all for miles since it was a weeknight and way out of the way.It had to be sometime between 12am and 2am when we finally both went in our separate tents and fall asleep. We were both almost asleep, then suddenly we heard this crazy yelling scream coming from the other side of the stream. it would last for about 10 seconds and then stop. And had to have screamed over 10 times. The noise is really hard to describe though. A screeching/bumbling/rattling with both high pitch and lower interchanged. When I try to tell the story, people mention a cougar. From what I've heard they weren't the same. This was far more bizarre.. I could maybe imagine a human attempting to make the sound, but the loudness and the length of the scream was unnatural. We both jumped in our cars and rolled down the windows. We could hear it get to the stream and possibly on the trail that leads to our campsite from the stream. We didn't hear the movements, Just the scream. I decided to blare on my horn and my friend popped his trunk and pulled out his shotgun. He fired off a shot into the sky and the scream stopped.  We slept in our cars and the next day we walked down the trail to the stream. We immediately realized how close it was to us and the effort it went though to try to scare us. As well as the balls they must have had in order to just walk up to a campsite screaming from the woods. We packed up the site and decided not to camp another night.  It took us a year to go back to Jones Creek.  We now go right at the 3 way stop and stay at the diamond mill staging area instead. We also did go and stay another night at the scream spot with another buddy of ours. Nothing happened. I am happy to see the report on the site because I still think about it.\"",

            "Observed": "Four of us were bowhunting in the Douglas Mountain area on private property.  It was around 3:00 PM and my brother was bugling for elk on a hill about 500 yards away from us.  Our younger sister was with him.  Our dad and I were sitting in our vehicle and our dad began to bugle at my brother.  The commotion got a response.  We heard an eerie howling ooooooeeeeeeeeuuu that was very powerful.  In a way it sounded like a human trying to sound like an elk.  The area we were in is miles from other roads and had no other hunters.  Neither one of us was making the noise.  Our dad got out of the truck as the sounds began to draw closer.  He saw a dark brown flash of fur in the pinions and cedars.  He thought it was an elk at first but knew the color was wrong.  We have hunted all our lives and knew the sound was not that of an elk.  When dad realized it wasn't an elk he became very nervous and jumped back in the truck.  When my brother and sister returned we asked them if they heard the same sounds and they said they did.  The closest sounds that resemble this are off the Bigfoot websites.  After the incident we quickly drove out of the area and we didn't return to hunt again.",
