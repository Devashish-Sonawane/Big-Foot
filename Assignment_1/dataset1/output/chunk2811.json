            "Observed": "It was our annual summer camping trip and I was in the back of the car with my uncle.  My grandmother and grandfather were in the front and my grandma and uncle were sleeping.  I was staring out the side window and slightly forward.  While looking I saw a large animal that I thought was a bear.  It was only a very brief view but the animal was walking upright and was very furry.  I mentioned to my grandfather that I saw a \"huge bear\" walking upright but he laughed and said it must have been trying to climb a tree.  But there was a break in the trees where I saw the creature.  It looked like it was going off of the side of the road into the forest.",

She had camped many times in this area with her family and has seen many bears.  This evening they were returning to camp around 9pm, she was on the passenger side of the car.  What she saw in the moonlight was larger than a bear, upright and bipedal.  She watched it take several steps moving through a small clearing as the car moved away.  ",
