            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed both witnesses and have the following to add to the report:- The incident happened in late summer of 1992 or 1993. The younger brother was eight to nine years old and the older brother was 12 to 13.- The older brother had a much better look at the animal and was able to provide me with much better data.  Also, the younger brother's testimony, while corroborating his older brother's, was a considerably more hazy memory, especially when it comes to distances and sizes.  That isn't surprising given his young age at the time and fear level during the incident.  As a result, I am going with the measurements given by the older brother.- The incident happened just after sunset when there was still enough light to see by, but everything was in shadow. The weather was clear and pleasant.- The animal was around seven feet tall, three feet wide at the shoulders, and had a \"V\" shaped torso.- Its fur was dark, and the older brother estimates that it was three to four inches long, based on what he could see as it ran.- Its head was large with a slight crest, a flat face, and no apparent neck.- Its arms/hands hung down to just above the knees. It swung them gracefully in wide arcs as it chased them.- The arms were slightly longer than the legs.- Originally, the animal was about twenty feet from the older brother when they were by the clotheslines. After the car turned around in the driveway, it followed them down the driveway in the woods (it is likely that this is when the younger brother saw it in the taillights). When the car got to the road, it emerged into the ditch and began chasing them.  The older brother reports that it was about fifty to one hundred feet from the van at this point.- It ran in a fluid gallop, full of grace.  It did not appear to be exerting itself much as it ran through the grassy ditch.  The mother clocked it at thirty miles per hour before it turned off into an open field. It had followed them for between one half to three quarters of a mile.- The area is a mix of farms, woods, and swamps and has a history of sightings.- The other possible sighting, described as a skunk crossing the road, was actually viewed from over the crest of a hill.  The witness believes that he and his mom actually only saw the head of the animal; the rest of it was obscured by the hill, thus the original thought of it being an much smaller animal. There isn't enough detail in this second sighting to say one way or the other. The witness does not remember looking for tracks.",

The tree pushed over behind his house is as he reported. And, his wife has been tossing food scraps, next to a 4' high wire fence, just behind the back deck on the house. They reported hearing something huge, standing just behind the fence, at night, reaching over it and shaking the fence, apparently to retrieve the scrap food.Where Phillip and his son were camping, is near a large farm pond, wooded land, with ravines. If Bigfoots were in fact herding a group of turkeys, to hunt them, as he reported hearing, the topography would support the described action.He also showed me where he took huis son in the woods, and he played, near a campsite. They often felt watched there. And one day found an Indian arrowhead left, where his son was playing.",
