            "Follow-Up Report": "These directions, submitted by the witness,  enabled me to easily find the tracks: \"To find the prints go to Table Rock parking lot. (Created when earthslide blocked the road.) I went up the road and little ways and took a trail off to the right that went a few hundred yards and then came back onto the road again. Continue up the road. The tracks are about two-thirds of the way between the point where the short trail joins the road again and the proper Table Rock trail begins. They are immediately to the right of the depression caused by the flow of people, a couple of feet away.    There was kind of a clear area on the right side of the road with small trees growing.      There were six or eight prints that I saw. They were four feet apart and you could see the right-left-right-left. It looked like he had been coming down the worn trail and had stepped off it for a few paces and then gotten back on.     Only one of the tracks had good detail that wasn't melted away. (The one photoed) The others were about the same overall size and shape and sat in the right sequence. It is hard to say how old they were. My brother said a week but I thought maybe the night before. It had been raining and the detail was being lost fast.     We did not disturb the one we took detailed pictures of but we dug around a little in the others looking for hair but we did not find anything.      There was nothing that I saw that indicated that the aminal might still be around. But then again there was nothing I could point to that would indicate that he was gone either.    We looked to find where he had gotten on the path and where he had left it but could not find anything. It is possible that he came from the Table Rock trail itself and so did not leave deep tracks that could be seen.    Hope this has been helpful. If you have any other questions I will try to answer. Let me know if you find anything else. And if I find anything else you will be the first to know.\"  Results of follow-up investigation:                    On 3/20/01 I visited the location of the track find on Table Rock Creek in the Mt. Hood Nation Forest southeast of Molalla, Oregon.  Precisely as the witness described, I found  widely spaced bare-foot prints that measured 14\" long and were spaced an average of 48\" apart (from heel of one foot to same spot on heel of the opposing foot).  I measured strides of 112\" between heel impressions of  the SAME foot in two places.  I counted twenty four prints in all.The tracks were beside a trail in the snow that follows a road bed to the Table Rock trailhead.  Auto traffic is cut off by collapse of the roadway but snowshoe prints and boot prints were evident all along the road.  The path along the road bed leaves the parking area as bare earth but gradually turns to completely snow covered.  Snow depth at the track location, which is about one mile from the parking area, is about 18\".  Several factors raise suspicion about the tracks: The tracks are close to other human tracks.  The foot length is 14\", which could be a human with size 14-15 feet.  The most impressive aspect of the tracks is the long stride between steps.  Still,  I was able to duplicate the long stride with running leaps.  I'm 6ft. tall.  Though  fakery cannot be ruled out, it is also possible that a hiker removed his shoes for whatever reason and ran in the snow in bare or stocking feet for some twenty-four steps.  The footprints looked to be made from bare, not stocking feet.  Toe detail on some prints seemed to be too clear for stocking feet.On the other hand, the location is remote, the snow is deep, the elevation is high, and it therefore seems much less likely that a very large, barefoot person would be running through deep snow to leave these impressions for us to find.  If the same tracks were found nearer to frequently traveled tourist locations, I would be more suspicious about their origin.  After visiting the site and viewing the tracks, I was able to resolve some of the concerns raised by Rick.  The tracks measued at a full 14 inches, maybe a bit more.  Stride was considerable: 48\" between same points in opposing feet and up to 112\" between same points in same foot.   Snow was 18\" deep at the track site.  Tracks penetrated 12\" deep on average.  The stretch of the trail with the tracks is north facing and preservation of the tracks has been aided by the lack of sun that strikes the snow in that shaded portion of the roadway.While it is possible that a hiker removed his shoes and socks and took about twenty steps off the trail in the deep snow, the stride is too long for comfortable human strides.  I was able to match the stride by running on the trail beside the prints and virtually leaping between steps.  It would be exhausting to accomplish this in bare feet and in the deep snow at the 3500 foot elevation, but it is clearly *possible* for a determined person with large feet to have made these tracks.Therefore, it seems unlikely to me that someone would go to this trouble in such a remote place.  Further, I saw several other possible barefoot tracks in other places along the trail, but greater sun exposure deteriorated them to the point where nothing can be determined for certain.  The tracks that were clearly evident looked to be about one week old.  The last heavy mountain snow was 3/14-3/16. My guess is that the tracks were made right after this, before the snow developed the stiff crust from sun exposure that it has now.   I favor the view that the tracks are genuine sasquatch tracks.  If genuine, why would the tracks be there?  Perhaps a bigfoot was travelling down Table Rock Creek toward the warmer forested lowlands along the Molalla River.  Or, could it be a resident sasquatch roaming it's home range? Either way, the compacted snow of the Table Rock  trail provides much easier travelling than trekking across deep and trackless snow.  The many boot prints on the trail also offers a means to travel without leaving discernible tracks if an animal wished to conceal its passing.  Some of us favor the view that bigfoots make efforts to conceal their movements whenever possible.  The numerous boot prints on the compacted snow trail would make recognition of individual tracks difficult.  So, why then, would one of these animals step out of the packed snow of the trail and leave these conspicuous tracks?  From the size of the feet and the look of the track run, I envision an older juvenile or young adult that stepped out of the trail but soon found the going to be strenuous and returned to the trail.  Speculation might include a strong-willed adolescent or two individuals sharing a narrow trail and jockeying for position.In any case, the Molalla River area and specifically the Table Rock Creek locality has historic bigfoot activity extending over many years.  Some field researchers consider it to be a hotbed of bigfoot activity.While investigating the site at 5pm on 3/20/01, I did some elk calls and other animal calls.  After doing my call, I heard two animal noises that I could not identify.  The first was a single, shrill, loud scream.  The other unfamiliar sound was a low \"whump-whump-whump-whump-whump-whump\" sound that quickened as it repeated seven times. it repeated several times and I taped it on my camcorder.  I thought of a grouse drumming but this noise was slower than the quick \"thumpa-thumpa-thumpa-thumpa-thump\" of grouse durmming that I'm familiar with.-Thom Powell",

We being kids we broke in to this place it was at lest 150 years old.So we and started to look at this old milk wagon the old horse and buggy kind. After some time we came across this ladder that went to attic my friend being smaller then myself gave me his gun and said I want to take a look up there. As I watched him climb up the ladder and look inside, he yells down to me dude something up here smalls really bad. As I watch him turning around on the ladder.I see him stop turning and he jumps from the top step he comes right down next to me.I say what the heck did you do that for.and as he says he can see these hairy legs behind this box something big runs across the attic floor and breaks down this wall to the other side of the garage and runs across the roof and out in to a cornfeld. I can remember looking across the room out the window and seeing its reflection on the window next door to the place we were in. And it was big! it ran the distance of the building in 5 or 6 foot hops then through the wall. FUNNY thing about this the doors we tried to break in flew open and this little whirl wind comes in and stays right in the path of the cornfeld and we can see his path.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Chris recounted the incident for me, providing additional details as a result of my questions. He now believes the event took place in October rather than in December as he original reported. On the day of the incident, it was partly cloudy, calm with temperatures in the 40\u0092s. Chris described the building as an old, dilapidated creamery that he and a friend, George came upon one day while out shooting their BB guns. It was a two story building, wood construction, with windows only on the second story, most or all of which had been boarded up. Adjacent to this building was another, smaller in size but in similar condition. Between the two buildings was a road or driveway which continued on into a field towards a sand or gravel pit. On the backside of the creamery, were two large wooden doors which provided access from a loading dock type area. A small roof overhung this area.  Chris indicated these doors could not be opened by them as they had two planks secured to them in an \u0093X\u0094 fashion. Ultimately Chris stated that the two were able to gain entry through a small chute like opening which was also in the rear of the building. Once inside, Chris said they began looking around and were able to see sufficiently as a result of sunlight entering through numerous small openings in the structure. At some point they found a narrow, permanently mounted wooden ladder on the back wall which provided access to the second floor through an opening in the ceiling. Chris recalled the ceiling height was between 12 and 14 feet. George ascended the ladder, stopping once he was able to observe the second floor area. Chris indicated that almost immediately George exclaimed, \u0093Oh my God, something stinks up here,\u0094 and within the same breath George practically jumped to the floor next to Chris. At that point Chris detected the odor which he described as, \u0093bad, dirty diapers, swampy, urine like\u0094. As George came to his feet he started to say he saw \u0093hairy legs\u0094 protruding from \u0093behind a box\u0094 when they both heard a series of \u0093booms\u0094 from above as if something heavy was running across the upper floor. Chris indicated they could see the ceiling boards move and dust fall at each location this \u0093thing\u0094 stepped.  They followed the movement with their eyes and after five or so steps, they heard a \u0093crash\u0094. At that point, through a window/opening in the wall, they saw, in a reflection from one of the windows in the adjacent building, a large human-like figure moving across the overhang above the loading dock. According to Chris, it looked left and right and then jumped from the roof and as it did, the two loading dock doors \u0093blew open\u0094 and they were then able see the \u0093creature\u0094 directly. Chris could offer no explanation as to how these doors opened. The witnesses viewed the back of the creature and did not see its face. Chris described it as greenish brown in color with long hair. He indicated that even standing in the loading area \u0093pit\u0094, which he recalled being about four feet high, the creature was as tall as them. Chris estimated it\u0092s height to be between seven and eight feet and its elbows were almost to its waist.  At that point the creature \u0093ran directly away from the highway\u0094 (road) which was located in front of the building back into a recently cut cornfield. Chris indicated it was definitely not a human or a bear as it was \u0093too big and bulky and moving away too quick.\u0094 They observed it for 7-10 seconds until it \u0093went through or over a fence\u0094 and disappeared from sight. I questioned Chris as to his opinion on how this large creature was able to get into the building when he and his friend had a tough time squeezing through the small chute. He said he didn\u0092t know but commented that a portion of the roof had fallen in and there were trees immediately alongside the building basically implying that it may have climbed in through the roof.Due to the age of this incident, my attempt to verify Chris\u0092 account was limited. A review of a topographical map of the area helped me identify what I believe to be the location of the incident. The map showed a rail line (long ago abandoned) running near a graveyard in the general vicinity of where Chris described the incident occurring. Creameries were often located along such lines. I spoke with a local historian who did recall there being two buildings in the general location I described to him, one of which could have very well been a creamery. I subsequently visited the location and did indeed find two relatively small buildings sitting next to each other with a small dirt road running between them. The road led to a gravel pit, as Chris described, which was still operational. The two buildings had obviously been rebuilt as they were now of concrete block construction and only one story in height. My estimate was that the renovations were done between 15 and 20 years ago. A closer examination of the building which would have been the creamery, indicated an original foundation of stone and mortar which I estimated to be at least 100 years old. Within that foundation, at the rear of the building, were the remnants of what could have been a loading dock type area. Beyond the buildings, looking toward the gravel pit were overgrown farm fields, still undeveloped.I indicated that I initially found Chris to be credible.I found some of the events/actions/ observations he described to be rather unique and not what I would consider fabricated (i.e. - the small tornado/whirlwind which formed when the doors allegedly blew open).
