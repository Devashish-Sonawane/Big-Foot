            "Follow-Up Report": "After a number of conversations with the witness and receipt of the referenced pictures, and given other events within miles of this location during the same period, I am very comfortable with the credibility of this report.There were a spate of bigfoot sightings and track discoveries in this general area in the early 1980's. Consult the BFRO database for Champaign, Union and Logan County for more reports and media articles. One of the interesting aspects of this track find is that it is within less than a mile of a Class A Report #5311 and within 6 months of those events. It also occurred the same month of another encounter approximately 20 miles north of this location.The area, at that time, was rural with a mixture of croplands and woodlots. Topographic features of the area include glacial moraines, which results in rolling terrain and steep hillsides of 100 to 200 feet in height. There are small ponds and swampy areas scattered throughout the area. The area has changed dramatically in the last 20 years with the opening of a Honda manufacturing plant in nearby Marysville, in many places road frontage of what were cornfields now hold single-family homes on 3-5 acre lots.",

I was driving along jamming on the radio, but looking for deer.  Deer are constantly running out in front of vehicles and causing accidents.  So I try to stay alert for the deer.  On this day I saw much more that I bargained for.  There on the side of the road in the edge of the woods was a bigfoot.  It was just standing there watching me drive by.  It did not seem violent or mean spirited.  It was at least 10 feet tall and covered with thick black hair.  I've watched for it every since then and have yet to see it again.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. The witness sighting was approximately thirty seconds in length and at about fifty feet distance. He slowed his car but did not stop. The creature was standing in the edge of the woods in a creek bottom area, and appeared to \"rock gently as it stood there\". The creature \"looked just like a big old hairy man standing there- more like a human than a gorilla\". The arms were long; the hands hung at knee length. The upper body appeared muscular, especially across the shoulders. The face had a distinct ridge above the eyes and the forehead was flattened and sloped upward, \"like a Neanderthal man\". No ears were visible. The creature did not have a distinct neck.  The hair was \"jet black\", pretty much the same color over the entire body, and appears as though it could have been coarse textured.  This report is across Lake Barkley for an earlier report Report #12641",
