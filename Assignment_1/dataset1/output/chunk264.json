            "Follow-Up Report": "The following information was gathered from the witness during a follow-up investigation:The witness works as a restaurant manager and was on her way home when she noticed the animal standing erect in the opposite lane in the road. At approximately 100 yards distance she flashed her highbeams then lowbeams thinking it was at first a dear, then maybe a bear, then as she slowly approached she thought it was a very large man. She began to pick up details that this was not a man. It was covered in hair four to five inches in length. Its head was conical in shape, no visible neck. Its arms were long and massive. Its legs were very muscular. As she passed it- she was filled with fear and accelerated. During this process, she recalls it turning and reaching out to her drivers side window with its hands as if to push the vehicle away from it. She said the only sound she heard was a reverbration like you get when you pass a truck on the highway. She said its torso filled the space of where her window was and if she were an inch closer it would have taken her drivers side mirror off. She recognized the torso hair was lighter in color than the rest of it yet consistent in length with the rest of its body. The witness gauges the height to above eight feet due to the height of her van. The day after the sighting, she and her sister returned to the area and noticed a drainage ditch running from one side of the road to the other and into the woods. There were no noticable tracks in the area as the ground was very compact. The area in which this sighting occured is mainly agricultural with cotton fields and cattle farms. There is an abundance of deer and other wildlife in the area as well. ",

There were a few hundred acres on derelict citrus groves nearby as well as a cypress swamp to the north and east of the pine forest.  The area we lived in was roughly 4 square miles between paved roads, but to the north, east, and west beyond the area I am describing, there were additional substantial areas of pine forest, palmetto scrub, and dense cypress swamp. Our house was situated on the crest of a hill, or at least what passes for a hill in that part of Florida.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke on the phone to the man who is an international business consultant now living in California. His recollection of the event that happened in the Fall of 1977 was detailed and intriguing.The house his family lived in is still there, but now surrounded by development. Here is a Google Earth image showing what the forested area looked like in 1995 (as far back as you can go on the site): The man was 13 years old that year and at the time the area was rural. He and his father would shoot rabbits in the yard on Friday nights, when his mother was out. He and his father were playing cards in the kitchen, and the TV was on. The house did not have central air conditioning and the windows were open. When they decided to step outside to shoot a few rabbits around 8 pm his dad had a head lamp on, and he held a flash light as his dad quickly flipped the backyard flood lights on.His dad was looking to the right, and he was looking to the left when movement caught his eye about 20-30 yards away that wasn\u0092t a rabbit. What he saw was entirely different \u0096 a hairy creature that he couldn\u0092t identify. It was about 6-8 feet from the tree line in the open yard crouching. It was in the process of standing from the crouched position. It spun to the right and walked rapidly into the woods on two legs. He did not get a clear view of its face, as it retreated quickly. He described it as being light brown in color \u0093like a buckskin horse,\u0094 and completely covered in hair. His father was 5\u009210\u0094 and 185 lbs. yet the creature seemed to be similar in height as him, but at least 70 lbs heavier. It was very broad in the shoulder and powerful looking in all aspects. The hair was about 5 inches long that looked unkempt but not knotted. It was not narrow at the hips as a muscular human is. He noticed the creatures head was tilted or pulled to the left side, and its posture never changed. He speculates it was deformed or injured in some way. There was no odor. Here is a sketch from the witness:He literally froze in fear and shock. His father heard it move through the woods and asked what was going on. He pointed in the direction to where it went, and couldn\u0092t speak. His father took him inside, and understood he was distraught. When he was finally able to speak he tried to explain what he had seen, \u0093a hairy thing on two legs\". Several minutes had passed and they began to hear the neighbor's hunting dogs barking and howling. The man claims that they had never heard the dogs bay that way before. His father called the Sheriff. After trying to describe what had happened he realized he couldn\u0092t explain it and eventually hung up. The dad then went outside to investigate and determined that \u0093something big had gone through there,\u0094 and appeared to be shaken by seeing the path that was left. It was several days later that he thought what he had seen could have been a bigfoot. A few weeks after the sighting his father came home and placed a newspaper on the table. The headlines were about a Skunk Ape. They did not discuss the story however he felt it was his father\u0092s way of validating what he had seen.  I was able to find the story, BFRO Media Article 713:The corner of the house where the creature was seen was near to the area they dumped the remnants of the rabbits. They kept the garbage and compost pile there too. Prior to going outside, they had been inside for an hour or more. From the location of where the creature was it would have been able to hear them and see the TV.  The property borders a powerline road. The location of the house is near Lake Tarpon and what is now the Brooker Creek Preserve, where we continue to receive reports to this day.",
