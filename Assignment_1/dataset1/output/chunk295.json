I can\u0092t come up with a definitive answer. My husband, brother, and I decided to do a short backpacking trip in the Salmo-Priest Wilderness area between Sullivan and Priest Lakes. We hiked in about 4 miles to our campsite, the site of an old forest service cabin. The cabin site is surrounded by firs, bear grass, and huckleberry bushes. It was a warm, sunny weekend. There was not much animal sign around. The huckleberries were not quite ripe at our elevation yet, so we did not see any fresh bear sign. Our campsite is also the only place with water for quite a ways around...I\u0092m not sure exactly how big of a radius.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness and her husband by phone. The hunter they talked to at first said he only saw bear in the area the previous year. They described the \"bounces\" as if something was thrown, not a log rolling or a branch falling from a tree. The husband described the running as \"heavy footsteps\" from something large, not like a deer or elk. When first heard, it was close at the edge of their camp. He threw a rock and it ran further but seemed to stop in the brush, followed by total silence, even after they threw more rocks. Because it seemed so large to him, the husband said, \"I'm glad I didn't see it.\" They are confident it was not a bear. They camp a lot and have had many bear encounters. They did not smell any foul odor. There is a long history of Bigfoot activity and sightings in this area. ",
