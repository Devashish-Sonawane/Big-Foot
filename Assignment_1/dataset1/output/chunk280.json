            "Observed": "I was going for a late night drive. I drove up past Cougar on 503. When I hit snow on a couple of corners, I started to get a little nervous about driving up any farther but still I chose to keep going. I had been seeing animals all night so I was really keeping my eyes open. When I slowed down to turn around, my car died. While trying to start it I was looking forward and noticed a large object standing on the side of the road which looked like a large man but I couldn't tell because it was out of the reach of my headlights. When my car started up the object quickly turned and strided off into the timber. That's when I knew it wasn't just a tree or anything like that. I have been up in those parts of the woods a lot and never seen anything like that. When I saw it turn away from me I couldn't calm down. I was terrified - the hair on my neck was standing up. It was just not a normal feeling. I believe I saw a bigfoot standing in front of my car along the edge of the road.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and have the following to add:- His car was stalled for less than a minute and he noticed the creature when the engine started.  - Although the illumination did not allow him a clear view of the subject, he did see defined movement of the legs striding and the arms swinging as it turned and walked into the forest. - He had seen numerous deer and elk on this drive in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.- The witness returned to the site 2 days later with several friends. There were track-like impressions but they could not discern any details due to snow accumulation since the sighting. - Judging from where the creature was spotted in front of some fir trees and up a slight (5\u0092) embankment, he estimated the height at 6 \u00bd  to 7 feet.- He observed the subject for 20 seconds in dim lighting conditions but at a very close distance. (approx. 20 yards)- As he mentioned in his narrative, the encounter was  unsettling for the witness and he departed the area immediately. He had no desire to return alone that evening nor since then.Other notes:- He is very familiar with this area as he spent a lot of time in these forests as a youth with his family on camping trips and day hikes.- 4 years ago, they found footprints in this area.

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was interviewed by phone, and added several details to the report he submitted:- The witness is an avid deer hunter, and was scouting locations to hunt. He was riding around with his girlfriend, shining his Maglite into the woods as he drove.- He hunted the area often and knows it well.The area is rural, and while there are houses, there are not many. The houses in the area are several miles apart, and on larger lots and tracts of land.- The area of the sighting had no houses at all, and there were no lights. There was a cow pasture with a barbed wire fence on the right side of the road.- The couple were in a Honda Prelude, and the witness downshifted and sped up to get a closer look as the animal crossed in front of the car. The headlights allowed the animal to be visible as it passed.- The witness kept the Maglite out the window as they approached, and then stopped the car.- The animal had walked into the woods approximately 20 yards, and was standing behind a tree. At this time, the witness thought his eyes must be playing tricks on him; as the tree appeared to move back and forth with a \"hump\" on its side.- When the sasquatch stepped out from behind the tree, it walked slowly away. When it turned its head towards the witness and his girlfriend, the witness said \"Did you see that?\" and his girlfriend, very upset, yelled \"Go, go, go!\"- They were both very shaken and scared. They wondered to each other \"What to do, what to do?\" The witness has not returned to the sighting area in more than 15 years.",
