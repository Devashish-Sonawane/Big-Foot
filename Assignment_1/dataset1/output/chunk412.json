            "Follow-Up Report": "In talking to the witness, I found him to have a sort of no-nonsense and serious attitude about what he experienced. Although he told me that his sense of security has not been affected, he did tell me that he purchased a 45/70 after his encounter. He said that although he is not inclined to look over his shoulder these days, and he has no plans to hunt and/or kill a sasquatch, he still wants to be sure that he has \"a chance\" should he encounter an aggressive one in the future.The area in which the witness and his friends were hunting is known as \"the hog pen\" because of the abundance of hogs in the area. \"The hog pen\" is in the Love Valley Wildlife Management Area (WMA), which consists of 7,746 acres. The WMA is located just south of Hickory Creek WMA in Love County and is on the western edge of Lake Texoma. The WMA's primarily riparian habitat varies from hardwood bottomlands to sandy river bottom areas along the Red River. In addition to the details given in his initial report, the witness further remarked that what he saw was \"ape like and huge.\" The witness seemed more struck by the size of the animal than anything else. He was amazed that something so large could remain obscure and hidden. He felt no dread or fear, but was concerned. After the witness's encounter, he immediately went into the typical stage of denial that so many witnesses experience after a sighting. It was only after he saw a television program about bigfoot and heard on the news about a sighting in eastern Oklahoma that he came to terms with his encounter. The witness has only talked to his wife and me about his experience.The Red River Basin, in both Oklahoma and Texas, continues to be a geographic source of sighting reports of this enigmatic, uncatalogued animal.

I was about 300 yds from county route 100 when I heard the noise. It was unlike any animal sound  I have ever heard. I have been a hunter and outdoorsman since my youth so for about 40 yearsI have been hunting from Pa. to florida and never experienced any thing like this  . I have heard Bobcats and hogs  but this was very different than thooses type of vocalizations",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness was interviewed by phone on the evening of Feb. 4, 2010 for about 50 minutes. After a morning of hunting from a tree stand in an archery-only section of the Camp Blanding Wildlife Management Area, the witness was exiting the woods closer to 09:30-10:00 a.m. and was about 300 yards from the road when he heard what he called \u0093\u0085the strangest noise I have ever heard; completely off-the-charts kind of sounds\u0094 based on about 40 years as a hunter and outdoorsman in Pennsylvania and Florida. He stated that he has heard all manner of large mammalian wildlife, including wolves, coyotes, bears, bobcats, etc. and this was nothing close to any sound he has ever experienced in the wild. He stated that the noises were VERY loud and penetrating, lasting for about two minutes. It made 4-5 vocalizations, then stopped for a time, then repeated this several times. He stated that the noises were a series of guttural growls, grunting sounds, and howls and were very ape-like; \u0093not aggressive, but more like an animal calling to another animal, in the genre of an identification call.\u0094 He also stated that the sounds did not appear to be out of fright or alarm. Having a biology background, the witness did some on-line research following this incident, and then decided to report it on BFRO.net. He stated that this experience literally made the hair on his neck stand on end and sent shudders through him. This was a very level headed, compelling witness and gave every indication that he had experienced an extraordinary incident. Based on other reports, both sightings and vocalizations in the same quadrant of this county (see Clay County Reports), it is the opinion of this investigator that this witness likely encountered vocalizations that match many previous descriptions of those of a Sasquatch creature.
