            "Observed": "While driving south on highway 199 from Grants Pass to Crescent City, my eight year old son said \"Hey Dad, what's that?\".  We were driving just above the Smith River as it snakes alongside the highway.  I assumed he was talking about perhaps a rafter or something but instead, to my surprise, he said \"I saw a hairy thing sitting on a rock in the middle of the river.  It was getting a drink or something\".  I asked him if he thought it was a bear.  He said \"No....it looked kinda like a gorilla\".  I have to go on what he said.  I didn't see a thing.  I was too busy driving.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the father, Paul, and the son Aiden tonight about the son's gorilla sighting in the northern part of California, along the Smith River.  Aiden, who is eight years old, has seen the movie \"Harry and the Hendersons,\" but it was some time prior to the sighting.  Aiden's father, Paul, stated that his son was sitting in the back of the van looking out the window when he observed a large hairy animal sitting on a rock in the river.  Paul asked his son, \"Was it a bear?\"  Aiden said \"No, it was a gorilla!\" This really took the father by surprise, but they continued on down the road.Paul said that the road follows the river pretty closely, and they were in a 180-degree curve following the Smith River. At that point, the road was about thirty feet above and about one hundred feet from the river. The river was low and moving slowly.  Paul said he was traveling pretty fast when the sighting occurred, and it probably lasted less than ten seconds.  The time of day was about 2pm in the afternoon.With the father's permission, I had the opportunity to ask Aiden just what he had seen. The following is what he observed. Aiden said, \"I seen this large chimpanzee squatting on a rock, using its hand, like it was drinking from the river. It was kind of bigger than a man, only afterwards did I think it was a bigfoot.  I saw its side and the front part of it. The face looked like a gorilla with ape lips.  The color was a dark brown, and it had hair all over.\"  Per Aiden, ape lips meant that they were thin.Aiden was very excited about the short sighting of the gorilla in the river, and Paul had to stop at the next small little roadside town and buy his son a bigfoot t-shirt and a bigfoot poster, which, by the way, had our BFRO website address on it, and that's how Paul got a hold of us.   In summary:  Paul and his son were very forthcoming and sincere in their rendition of the short sighting.  I believe that Aiden saw a bigfoot creature squatting on a rock in the Smith River. ",

            "Observed": "My wife and myself were visiting her mother in south Alabama shortly before moving to Florida.  At approx. 0100-0200 I was was voluntold to get our bags out of the car since we hadn't brought them in.  The car was about 30 ft from the bottom of the ramp on the back porch and 20 ft from the north end of the car port (which is mostly open, except for a single partially closed in section on the north end).  The night was dead silent with no wind. Upon reaching the bottom of the ramp I began to turn to my right towards the car when I heard what can only be described as similar to a bull snorting mixed with a grunt.  I immediately turned towards the location of the sound, the back of the carport, and drew my sidearm.  Due to a light on in the carport being pointed directly at me, I could not see what it was, but a shape.  I had a small flashlight on me and pointed it at the thing.  It didn't help much due to the light being in my eyes, but I was able to make out a creature bigger than me and at least 3 ft across at the shoulder. It made the sound again, but didn't move. I called out to it, thinking it was a person, but no response.  After what felt like a few minutes, it made the sound again and seemed to get shorter. I began to move to my right towards the car to retrieve a rifle I kept in there and the thing moved to my left, so that we effectively circled each other until it reached the end of the carport on the south end.  I reached the car and without turning, retrieved my rifle.  As i pulled it out, the creature turned towards the woodline at the back of the property and seemed to either slowly run or quickly walk into the brush.  i took this time to go back into the house and get a better flashlight.  I came back out maybe 5 minutes later after finding one, to find nothing.  The guard dog had reappeared and you could hear various insects around.",
