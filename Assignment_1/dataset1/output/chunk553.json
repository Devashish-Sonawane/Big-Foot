            "Observed": "While driving through the Ocala National Forest in Fl on Highway 19 a couple of years ago, I look from my car window to the right and saw what I believe was a big foot looking back at me.  It was in a cleared area that had probably been controlled burned at some point, so I clearly could see a figure covered with dark brown fur from head to toe.  It stood about seven feet tall and had the shape of a man, not a monkey.  It was broad in the shoulders and narrower at the waist.  It gazed at me half behind a tree, not shy or fearful, but as if it was in its own element and it was noticing me driving by on the highway.  It moved behind the tree out of my sight as I drove by.  There is never much traffic on this road thru the forest. I never saw it again on any trips.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Location of the sighting:While driving down HWY 19 between Salt Springs and Palatka on June 7, 2010, the driver saw a very tall, dark haired biped off the west side of the road.  She saw the creature here, from her vehicle:When I spoke to the retired teacher on the phone, she explained how she used to drive this desolate road several times a week. This particular morning around 9:30 AM, the day was \u0093very pleasant\u0094 so she was looking around as she drove. As she drove by an area that was partially cleared, she noticed a sasquatch about 30 \u0096 50 feet off the road.  She knew what it was immediately. There was no mistaking it for a black bear as it was standing erect and at least 7 feet tall, and looking very much like a hairy human.  She did not see fear or alarm on its face, but more of a \"smile\" as it showed its teeth. She saw intelligence as it locked eyes with her. She stopped her car and it then very \u0093effortlessly\u0094 took a large step and went behind a tree. She described it looking more Neanderthal than gorilla-like. An artist worked with the witness and this sketch was produced:The entire sighting took several seconds but she was able to describe several more things:-It was uniform in color \u0096 dark brown or black.-It did not have breasts.-Its face was framed by hair, but none on the face.-Its hair was 4-5 inches long and definitely hair not fur.-It stood straight up with very broad shoulders that tapered to a smaller waist. It had an athletic body.-It had extremely long arms.-The nose had larger nostrils than a human and it had a prominent brow.-The head was not conical.-The dark eyes were set very wide apart.-The teeth were large, square & \"yellowish\".-It seemed to have a short \"goatee beard\".The sighting took place in the Ocala National Forest, not very far from Lake George.  Encompassing approximately 383,000 acres, Ocala National Forest is the southernmost forest in the continental United States.  The BFRO has more recorded sightings in this area, than any other area in Florida.  Although there are many sightings for this area,  the following reports are very near to where this sighting took place.Report #23076 ,                                                                        Report #23120 ,                                                                        Report #27778Compliments and special thanks to Pete Travers for the amazing sketch of the witness' bigfoot.
