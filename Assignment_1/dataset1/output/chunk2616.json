            "Observed": "I was driving from Windom. It was after midnight. I had the high beams on as you never meet another car at that time of night. I saw a dark colored upright figure, like a \"big\" man run across the road. The figure was at the edge of my headlights so I didn't get a real clear look at it. It ran from the west to the east. I was traveling pretty fast so I reached where it had crossed within a second or two and it was gone. It had disappeared into a cluster of cedar trees that were along the fence line. I have only told a couple of people about it. At the time I didn't think about it being a big foot because I have never heard of any in the area. After reading other reports recently, I am convinced of what I saw.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness who seemed like a level-headed individual and definitely seemed to be telling the truth. The sighting took place on a late, night/early morning in February of 1992 between 12 am and 1 am. The witness was driving home from a visit to her cousin's house. It was a clear, cold night, \"crispy.\" The area where this happened was a rural area, about a mile north of the North Sulphur River, riverbottom land. The nearest residence was 1/2 to 1 mile away. The area is wooded, with grazing pasture. She noticed something cross the road in front of her at the edge of her headlight beams. When she noticed it, it was already in the road. It then crossed from west to east. There were cedar trees lining the road where it crossed over, as well as a barb wire fence. When she got to the spot where it crossed, she did not see the creature, nor any evidence of its crossing. The trees were not disturbed and they were not moving as if something had passed through them. She has seen other animals cross the road at night, even some black panthers. This thing was definitely upright, on 2 feet. She saw it from the profile, it never turned toward her. She described it as at least 7 feet tall and covered with hair. The hair was very dark, she is not sure if it was black or very dark brown. The hair on the head was fairly long, it blended into the neck and shoulder area. This made it appear as if there was no definitive neck. The shoulders were hunched forward. Its arms swung as it ran across the road at a rate much faster than a human. She described it as looking like the \"Chewbacca\" character from Star Wars. It was fairly lean, not bulky. It looked proportional for its height. As a teenager, the kids from school would hang out in the bottoms at night. She has heard vocalizations that are identical to those recorded by the TBRC and other groups. Before I played our recordings for her, she attributed the sounds to panthers or mountain lions in the area. After hearing these sounds, they would pack up and leave, being spooked by the sounds. Her father told her tales of some kind of creature in the area that he had heard about growing up. TBRC Investigator\u00a9Copyright 1999-2003 Texas Bigfoot Research Center  ",

I've seen black bears in the wild.  There isn't any way a bear could be shaped remotely like the thing I saw. The arms were LONG and not thick.The hair was about 6\". The eye shine was from a ways up the road.  As I pulled even the face was pointed straight across the road.The angle of the bent elbows was about 20 degrees.To tell you the truth, I was kind of stunned, numb, and not quite able to digest it. There was no fear.  I'm sure I would have seen nothing had I not slowed down to 25 or so mph and been looking for deer.  I think the thing was pretending to be a bush. In my 80's experience, I felt utter fear and unreasoned terror, without actually seeing anything.",
