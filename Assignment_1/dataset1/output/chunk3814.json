It was at least 7 feet tall with reddish brown hair.  The hair was longer on the shoulders and back and thin enough in some spots to see through.  Compared to a human, the arms were longer in proportion.  This is a very rural area in the southernmost portion of West Virginia.  Steep, rugged, rocky and inhospitable terrain.  She mentioned there being many old mine openings, in addition to caves.The incident still seems like yesterday to the witness, and she and her sister talk often about the experience.",
