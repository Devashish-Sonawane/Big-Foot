            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness, 42, was returning from a trip to Denver.\"I turned off at I-70 at Copper Mountain. I'd gone 10-15 minutes up the road and came to a little valley floor where there was an open area you might call a meadow. As I was coming up, way ahead I noticed a really tall tree stump at least eight feet tall. I thought 'Look look at that, it must have been a blue spruce.' As I got closer it started to look like someone carved it. So I now thought, 'Wow, someone must have come out and carved that tree.'\"As I started to ask myself, 'Why would someone carve this thing?' -- it seemed to rotate from the waist up and look at me. I've seen dozen of bears, and this was much more than that.\"I saw a head and obvious facial features. It was furry from head to toe. There was a little gap between one arm and its body. It had long legs. At this point I was perpendicular to it and looking right at it. I started hitting my brakes. Right then a car coming from the other direction hit his horn. I just slammed on my brakes, pulled over and skidded to a stop. I kicked up this huge amount of dust, and lost sight of it. I spun my jeep around, went back, and couldn't see a thing -- there wasn't any tree out in the middle of the field, there wasn't anything. \"There was no snout, no ears. When you see a bear, you usually see a big butt, round ears and a snout that looks like a large dog's snout. I saw none of that. \"In all honesty, it could have been a huge man in a costume just goofing with people. But I went to high school with a guy who was 6' 10'' and 250 pounds. I used to work with a pastry chef who was 6' 7'' and  300 lbs. This thing was bigger than that. And a big man in a suit couldn't clear out that quickly.",
