            "Observed": "At the time of the incident I was 15 years old and had spent my entire life in the woods.  I knew what was out there and how to identify it.  It was about 3:00pm and I was walking home from school through the woods.  As I was walking I had an uneasy feeling and started to look around at my surroundings.  I eventually dismissed my feeling and chalked it up to my mind playing tricks on me.  I continued on my walk, with my head down, not thinking anything more about my uneasy feeling.  I happened to glance up and notice \"someone\" standing in the trail ahead of me (about 70 - 80 yards.)  I originally dismissed the person due to the fact it was common practice for some people to get out of school and smoke cigarettes or dope in that area.  I concluded that what I saw was a person partaking in one of those practices.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length on the phone.  There is not much more to add to what the witness has already written, as he has done a thorough job in describing his encounter.  When I commented on how detailed his report was written he mentioned he has had training in law enforcement, so he was well versed in reporting the details.  He described himself as being an avid outdoorsman and hunter and deer hunts in the general area.  Even though it has been 7 years since the sighting, I arranged to meet the witness at the sighting location.  On 9/30/06, the witness and I walked down the trail to where the sighting occurred.  The woods were dense and would be easy for anything to escape notice in it.  It was raining the entire two hours we were out hiking through the woods.  We hiked in a large loop, taking the easy walking advantage of the existing old logging trails and game trails.  We came upon two water sources; one was a swamp type area and the other a small pool, possibly a natural spring.  While trekking down a well traveled game trail we came upon an unnaturally placed stick structure, which blocked the trail.  We both determined it was unlikely that it had fallen naturally there.  Leaving it undisturbed we continued further down the game trail another 30 yards and came across another stick structure of the same shape, again blocking the trail.  The sticks used for construction this time were straight and larger and definitely did not fall into place.  Another 20 feet beyond that was yet another stick structure of the same shape, again blocking the trail.  As we looked around the woods from that area we found two more stick structures on each side of the game trail about twenty feet into the woods.  The trail was in a half horseshoe shape, and was at the rim of small ravine.  We left the stick structures undisturbed and then continued on back to our vehicles, with no other unusual observances.
