She recounted her sighting to me, adding that the distance was about 150 yards when it appeared that the creature noticed the car approaching. At that time, the creature crossed the road in front of the car and vanished into the woods. The witness stated that when they stopped to see if they could see the creature in the forest, they were so startled that they did not think to look for tracks.The witness also stated that from where she was, it appeared that the creature was a dark brown in color.  It was around 6 - 7 p.m. and there was still plenty of sunlight. She has seen bear in the Ocala National Forest, including one standing on its hind legs.  This figure's torso was thinner than a bear's and the arms were long, and she could see them swing as it walked.  They drive this route often and comparing it to the trees, she estimated the height to be 5 1/2 - 6' tall and not big and bulky as often described.The witness also told me of an occasion when her father was hunting years ago and had a sighting. Do to his health conditions, I was unable to speak with him.",
