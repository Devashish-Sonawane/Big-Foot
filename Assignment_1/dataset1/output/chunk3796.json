            "Observed": "I was talking with my sister in the spare room. She and her kids were spending the night. Her kids were sleeping and she was just getting into bed. My two dogs were barking outside, so I decided to take them for a walk since I figured they wanted me to take them out of the cage to do their business. I went to the backyard and opened the cage, but before I let them out, I placed the leash on their necks so they wouldn't run around and make trouble. They were barking more then usual, like when company arrives in the drive way, but there was no one.  I went to the front of the house and got to the street. I noticed that the bushes in front of the neighbor's house were moving and thought it may be a deer. As I kept walking I looked back to the bushes with curiousity and I noticed a figure walking from the bushes towards the back of the neighbor's house. Their entire front and back yard was lit due a full moon and I could see a human shape going towards the back slowly, almost like hiding. It was weird because I could see the reflection of the moon on its entire body, as if it was wearing something that reflected the light very well. I turned around with the dogs and went down the hill towards the end of the street. I kept looking to the left since I knew that whatever I saw (if it wasn't human) had to cross an opening across the other neighbor's front yard to escape into the woods. As I approched the mailbox of the last house of the dead end, I kept looking to the house on the left, their driveway went up hill. The full moon illuminated the driveway very well. I stopped and waited about a minute. The dogs started barking even more. Then I saw something running on two legs across and the dogs wanted to go after it, the chain almost slipped from my hands and they were pulling so hard. The thing ran across and went into the trees. The entire body had what appeared to be hair all over. I couldn't tell  whether the fur was dark gray or brown. I'm leaning more to brown. But everything else was as clear as day. I then thought to myself, if it was a thief dressed in a monkey suit going from yard to yard thru people's properties why then wasn't he smart enough to wait until I left with my dogs to run across? And if it was a practical joke from someone, that guy must had really had to have guts of steel to listen to mad barking dogs and still run. Besides, it's a crime to traspass thru multiple houses' yards, specially so late at night just for a joke. I told my sister the next day about it, she remembered the unusual loud barkings of the dogs and she confessed she felt a little concerned about it. I'm glad she believed me. I didn't tell my parents though. . That's the first and last experience I had with something I couldn't explain.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "A 40 minute phone interview conducted with the witness produced the following information.The witness turned left out of his driveway in a direction away from the end of the dead end street. The initial sighting in the neighbor\u0092s backyard located on the other side of the street from the witness\u0092s house lasted for approximately 10-15 seconds at an estimated distance of 25-30 yards.  The animal walked upright during the initial sighting and its height was estimated between 6 foot and 6 foot 6 inches using the neighbor\u0092s bushes as a reference point.  During this initial sighting the witness\u0092s dogs were fixed in the direction of the animal but were not barking.The witness continued walking in the street in the same direction and decided to turn around approximately 30-40 seconds after the initial sighting. The witness reached the end of the dead end street approximately one minute later. After waiting an additional one minute, the witness saw a bipedal creature emerge from the backyard of the last house on the street. The animal ran at a moderate pace with arms swinging to the side in a parallel direction to the witness across a lawn grass clearing toward a wooded area immediately adjacent to the dead end street.  The witness described the animal as having a head profile similar to a human with a medium body build and fluffy, dark colored hair.  This stage of the sighting was approximately 20 seconds in duration at a distance of approximately 30 yards until the animal disappeared into the wooded area. No vocalizations or unusual odors were observed during the initial and later sighting.The wooded area is the southern border of a moderate tract of undeveloped land.  A creek runs through this tract of land.",
