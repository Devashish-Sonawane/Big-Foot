            "Observed": "Let me start by saying that I hesitate to tell my story to you but I need to.  When I moved to DeQueen, Arkansas in 1987 I was told about a story of a \"wildman\" that some of the locals called this thing described as a big, hairy, wild man.  A girl that I knew swore that while parked out in the country it came up behind her car and bounced it up and down by putting hands on the trunk.  She was terrified.  About 2 miles from where she said that happened, I had an experience myself.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken with Robert many times about his experience over the last year. He is a medical professional and sincere family man with an impeccable reputation among his peers and colleagues. Robert submitted his report several months before I would meet him in person on my Oklahoma Expedition. We spoke about his experience often during our initial phone calls and interviews, and again during the expedition. I will usually encourage witnesses to speak openly about their experiences during expeditions so that new researchers or enthusiasts can have the opportunity to interview and learn from witnesses in an environment which is conducive to discussing sasquatch encounters in a group setting. Robert's narrative of the incident has been consistent and direct each time I've heard him discuss it. His encounter has encouraged him to learn more about sasquatches, and has driven him to pursue evidence and data related to them. After attending a public BFRO expedition, he became an investigator for the organization. I am convinced that he encountered a sasquatch that night. ",

            "Observed": "J.W. and I were archery elk hunting and camped in the snow park between the Indian Heaven berry fields and Lone Butte. I had seen considerable elk activity about 1/2 mile from the meadows headed toward Lone Butte, on the north side of FR 30. J.W. killed an elk the year that this occurred so he could tell you for certain which year is was, I believe it was '98.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed witness J.W., at length on February 16, 2002. I then spoke with the other witness, S.P., for about 1 hour on the evening of February 19.  Both were very helpful, and were very familiar with the area these incidents occurred in. Both are also experienced outdoorsman. The track they found in September of 1999 was located on the east side of FR 88, where it crosses Meadow Creek, about 1 mile SE of the FR 88/FR 8851 (Big Tire) Junction. The track sat on the south side of the creek, about 10 yards from the road, near a wildlife trail. The soil was a wet, sandy mixture that left a good, distinct track.  The track sat in an area that was surrounded by rocky terrain.  The witnesses both mentioned that a person, or animal, could easily approach the creek while staying on top of the larger rocks, but this one stretch of sand was 6 feet across, and any animal would have to step in the sand to continue along the trail.  The track in question was placed right in between the rocks on each side of the sand.  S.P. looked to see if the track was the result of someone dislodging a large rock, but soon ruled out that possibility. The large, or great, toe was visible in the track, which had the appearance of a \"big, gnarly foot.\" The witness did not measure the track at the time, but he did place his foot next to it for comparison. He estimates that the track was about 14-15 inches long, and 6-7 inches wide. Also, the track impression was fairly deep. The witness, who weighed about 225 lbs., said that his print went only about 1/3 as deep as the track they'd found, which they estimated to be 3/4 of an inch deep.The vocalization heard by S.P. in 1999 took place a few miles west of the track location, near the north end of the Indian Heaven Wilderness. He had placed a tree stand for hunting elk just a few hundred yards from FR 30 near Cayuse Meadow, which sits just a couple of miles east from where the BFRO's Skookum Meadow Expedition discovered an alleged sasquatch impression in September of 2000. The stand was set in dark, old-growth forest on the south side of Cayuse Meadow.  It was late in the afternoon when this started. The witness had been in his stand for some time, remaining completely still and quiet. He had also attempted to mask his scent by spraying elk lure on the ground near his stand. S.P. claims that the \"whoop\" call that he heard is very similar to the whoop that is heard on the Sierra Sounds Website, except that the \"whoop\" he heard started out lower in pitch, and then proceeded much higher in pitch than the recording.  He also mentioned that the starting point of the \"whoop\" was about as low in pitch as that of a cow when it moos.  Not to say that it sounded like a cow, but it had a very bass quality, and he could feel the vibration of the call in his body, despite the animal producing the call being in excess of 50 yards away.  I am sure that anyone who has been in close proximity to cattle, or who has stood at the hippopotamus pen at the local zoo, can appreciate what it is like to \"feel\" these deep vocalizations.",
