No photos or casts were taken of these tracks in a dirt roadway.-Upon exploration of the nearby area, they found evidence of twisted, broken tree limbs in an area where it would be \"next to impossible for a machine to have caused the damage\" and submitted the following photos they took of them:Close-up image.",
