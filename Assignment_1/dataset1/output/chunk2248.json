            "Observed": "Since October I have had many howls, wood knocks, eyeshine instances. I believe they have always frequented the hardwoods across the street, but since the recent logging of thousands of acres of pine in the area they have taken up full time residency across the street. There is a large swamp that butts up to the hardwoods. The night of January 21st, 2017 was the most incidental of all so far. After making some calls on my front porch I got a wood knock from the woods across the street. My dog ran toward the activity and barked for a long time. When I heard his collar stop jingling and the barking stopped I got worried and went into the woods with a large limb. I beat against a large oak and yelled \"I want my Dog!\". I heard a woodknock close by then a chest beat and a bluff charge through the brush. Then a tree push down. I yell roared \"I want my Dog!\" and beat hard against the tree. I saw eyeshine ahead I I told him to back away so my dog will come to me and we will go home. He did and my dog came out and we went home.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness on several occasions. He lives alone in a secluded area with his dog Bubba. Across the street from him is a massive swamp, along with a good sized hardwood forest that adjoins the swamp. He clarified the description of the area and is noted as follows: Across the street from his home is the Church of God. It is on the main road. Behind that is an old abandoned house, which he is fairly certain was abandoned years ago as the swamp slowly encroached, surrounding the home. I will first address his initial report, then address the photos attached to this report. He was familiar with Sasquatch and their traits, and has been making calls, knocks, etc whenever he detected activity.On the evening of Jan.21, 2017, as stated, he was sitting on his front porch with his dog, making occasional knocks,howls and calls. When he finally got a response, his dog ran towards the activity. Along with the knock response, there was some heavy rustling in the woods as well. He ran after his dog but had to stop, as the woods and darkness kept him from going further into the woods. He stood there for a bit, calling his dog. His description above is accurate so I won't elaborate on it, other than to add his additional recollection. He indicated that, though his dog is \"big & bad\" he will get very submissive when you speak sternly to him. It was at the point he heard the collar stop jingling and \"a faint whimpering\". Once he heard that is when he started yelling for his dog back. The \"creature(s) made a bluff charge, what sounded like chest beating, howls, tree pushed over, etc. Classic simian display, as he described it. He also saw eye shine.Now, as for the attached photos, this is the series of events that led to the photos being taken. Early February he took his riding mower (tractor) across the street to mow a path to the woods and swamp. There is very tall grass that leads to a small clearing, which gives minimal access to the swamp and forest behind. He mows a path, so he has a better chance to see and avoid brown recluse spiders and snakes which are rampant in that area. He mows every 2-3 weeks or so. As he had finished mowing, he got off the tractor to look around when he saw the footprint. It was so fresh that the water was still filling the print, which in his estimation, meant the creature had been standing there less than a minute before. He took out his phone, (flip phone) and took a photo of the print, and several of the area in a scan of the area. The footprint outlined very lightly next to the shoe is 17.5 inches. He wears a size 12. He did not see the creature standing there when he took the photos, as he was concentrating on the small screen on his phone as he scanned the area. He estimates he was 20 yards or less from the creature.As he was looking at the photos, making sure he got what he wanted, he heard \"something sloshing through the swamp in a human type gait. Sounded just like a person walking through the swamp, one foot after the other\". The hair on the back of his neck was \"standing straight up\" and he then \"got the heck outta there\". He sent me the photos, which were taken about two weeks after his initial report. An original photo from the witness:This is one of the photos with the figure in it, taken by the witness, sepia tone was added to it for better contrast and clarity:Having spoken to the witness numerous times, I do not get any indication of hoaxing, embellishment, and find him sincere and down to earth. These photos are the property of the witness and that I enhanced and are marked as such. The photos were taken with a flip phone. They were run through several tampering detection programs and all came up negative for tampering and or enhancement. The witness does not own a computer and must use a public library computer when the need arises. This also makes the likelihood of tampering much less likely.These photos show a POSSIBLE shape or figure (mid to lower right of the photo in the original), and though we consider this \"blobsquatch\" in nature, in the context of the event that occurred that made him grab his phone, this investigator believes that he \"saw\" and heard something. He did not \"see\" the creature or figure at the time he took the photos.  This investigator then took the photos and enhanced them with adding/removing color and black and white filters, enlarging and cropping. The following black and white photo is my version with a bit more clarity. I believe his story, that he has had several incidents, but the photographic evidence presented is marginal at best, as far as \"proof\" goes. Again, the photos are provided as an addition to his event, and are provided as a courtesy. They do not represent \"proof\" of the existence of sasquatch and are not endorsed by the BFRO. BUT, these are photos of an event that he cannot explain away with traditional explanations, and the sum of his experiences indicate encounters/experiences that be believes to be real. The number of other peripheral encounters has gone on on a mostly regular basis. He has provided other photographic evidence, but they remain in the \"blobsquatch\" category. He saw them, and took quick, instinctive photos. As with any witness, these types of photographic evidence are clear only to them, as they were there and had the experience, and we were not. Does not indicate the event didn't occur, just that clarity is in the eye of the beholder.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness several times by telephone. As a result of those discussions, a few more details and observations can be added to his original report. The animal was actually squatting about two feet off the right shoulder of the road in grass that was about six inches tall. It was positioned at an angle to the road, with its back somewhat facing the west bound traffic. The animal appeared to be looking down intently at something (which was unseen by the witness) in the grass near its feet. In its squatted position, the animal's forearms were resting on it thighs or knees, with its elbows extending outward past its torso. The witness estimated the animal's body was about four feet wide, with each elbow extending about six inches past the body. The height of the animal in the squatted position was estimated to be five and one half feet.The witness (a medical professional) stated he could clearly see the contour of the major muscles in the animal's back, even though the animal was covered in eight to ten inch long, somewhat matted, hair. The hair was predominantly a \"dirty light grey\" but with streaks that were black or silver colored. The witness sent me an internet photo showing the hair on the Scottish Highland breed of cattle (Bos Tauras), which he said had hair similar to that he saw on the animal alongside the roadway. He also included a photo of a mature male gorilla squatting, and stated that what he had seen more closely resembled the gorrila than any other known amimal.As the witness slowed to pass by the figure he could see that the animal's upper body was very thick, but could see none of its facial features. He stated he not able to see or describe the shape or size of the animal's head because it was tilted downward and its upper body partially blocked his view.He stated that at the time of the sighting there were only two vehicles in front of him, but they quite a distance away. He saw no traffic behind him.After discussing this event in detail, I concluded the witness is a credible observer and that what he saw was not a typical wild or domestic animal..The sighting location is less than five miles SE of Grassy Lake, which is part of the Bell Slough WMA. A report and photographs regarding bare, human-like tracks in the mud near Grassy Lake can be found in Report#29313It is also within 0.5 mile of White Oak Bayou which passes under I-40 and forms Devoe Lake and associated wet-lands one mile east. White Oak Bayou begins in Camp Robinson, which contains 32,000 acres, 4000 of which are designated a WMA and the rest an Arkansas National Guard training area. The animal seen by the witness was about two miles west of the western boundry of Camp Robinson.Over the past few decades there have been several first-hand reports and some anecdotal reports by local residents of large, hirsute and enigmatic primates in northern Pulaski County and along the major creeks in Faulkner County.",
