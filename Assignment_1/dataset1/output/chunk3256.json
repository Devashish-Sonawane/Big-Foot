            "Follow-Up Report": "  I was able to speak with the actual witness by phone.  He said the event occurred in 1994, during the late fall or winter. He was not sure of the exact month, but remembered that the trees were bare. He said that he and his girlfriend had been parking on a dirt lane between two fields. There were trees and brush along both sides of the lane. As they prepared to leave they noticed something standing alongside the lane about forty yards ahead. He turned on the headlights and they saw an upright, hair covered creature about five or six feet tall. The hair was dark in color, almost black, and \"real shaggy. It didn't look slicked back\".  When the headlights hit the creature it took a step forward, turning to look at them as it did. The reflected eye shine was yellow. It took another two steps and disappeared across the lane.It's body build was stocky and it's arms appeared to reach to almost knee length. He also noted that the creature may have been slightly stooped, making the arms appear longer than they actually were. He did not recall any particular facial details. Both individuals were frightened by what they had just seen. They unsuccessfully tried to turn the car around once, then backed out down the lane.I asked about the \"creature on the roof\" comment. He said at that point they were just both really scared, and they actually had no reason to believe the creature might really be on the roof.I was unsuccessful in locating the second witness.",

The witness recalled being behind another car at the time that the supposed Sasquatch crossed the road. Both cars came to a near stop at the location that the creature disappeared into the trees. The witness was unable to locate the creature in the brush. Neither occupants of the two cars got out to look around, they continued up the road to Mt. Bachelor. The witness described the creature as being very large, dark in color, having fairly long arms, and being quite tall. The creature was definitely walking upright on two legs. The witness has seen many animals in the wild, as he has grown up hunting, and he was unable to attribute this sighting to any known animal. He was also unable to see the mouth or eyes as the creature did not turn to look at the oncoming cars, but rather headed straight for the cover of the forest. This particular area is very densely forested and close to many sources of food and water.",
