The witness had previously submitted another report, see: Report # 37972The two sightings were 25 years apart at the same location. The small farm has been owned by the family for several generations. The home, which is located in an agricultural area had several fruit trees and a large pond.  As well as being close to large tracts of woods it is also one mile from the Ohio River. The witness did not tell his parents about what he saw from fear of them not believing him. He cleaned up the garbage the following morning. \u0095 The animal stood over seven feet tall \u0095 The animal weighed over 300 lbs. \u0095 The hair was brownish-red.  \u0095 The witness was unable to see any facial features. \u0095 The burn barrel was only 30 feet from the window. \u0095 The area was lit by a motion detector light.
