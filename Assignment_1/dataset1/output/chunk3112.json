            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a biologist, specializing in bears. He was a college student at the time of his sighting. He has spent many days in the field, and it was only on this one occasion that he ever witnessed such a creature. He is very confident that what he saw that morning was not a bear, a man, or anything he studied in a Biology class. He claims in all seriousness, \"It's much easier to tell you what it is not, than what it is.\"In September of 2006 he was riding his horse in a remote area. The area had two ridges with a valley in the middle. He was riding his horse up on one ridge when he saw a tall, upright, biped figure walking south just below the opposite ridgeline.  He watched it for about 3 seconds and moved his horse higher so he could have a better view. When he looked back towards it about 10 seconds later, it apparently had seen him and the horse as it had completely turned around and was now running in the opposite direction.  He watched it for another 10 seconds, and to this day, he is still amazed at its mass and speed.It ran to the only place on the hill that had cover and disappeared into it. Unfortunately, it was too far away to see facial details. Approximately 1500 feet, or about 5 football fields away. The witness was able to conclude several things from the sighting. The bigfoot obviously was very familiar with the area. It was walking below the ridgeline so it wouldn\u0092t be seen. If it had been higher, the houses on the other side would have been able to see it. Also, when it retreated it turned around and went to the only place on the hillside that had cover. Most things would have run forward to get away; it knew it could only find cover if it turned around.  Also the area that it was coming from had a residence that was only used occasionally. Humans didn\u0092t go to that area often, and that morning the witness remembers going into the wind, so the bigfoot would not have had his scent. When asked about other stories his peers may have about sasquatch, he claimed that he had never had anyone mention it.   He felt that was odd in itself, except for the fact that he too has never shared his encounter with any of his peers. Topo map he sent to me:Google earth image of the location:",
