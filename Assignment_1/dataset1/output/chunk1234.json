He could not see any facial details as the creature was standing under a street light. A second person was present when the possible bluff charge occurred. They were waiting on the 3rd member of the party and did not want to leave without him. I will advance the theory that when the charging animal in full view of his target did not react by fleeing, it caused it to pause and take the safest course of action by hiding itself. He stated during the wait for #3 of the group, what sounded like a long conversation took place all around them. The \"Raccoon chatter\"  sounded to the witness like they were communicating with each other. When the 3rd member arrived, he had an ashen appearance like the blood was drained out of his face. He refused to discuss what had him spooked until they walked to the parked vehicle. There he revealed he was followed for the past hour by something walking on two legs, staying just outside visual range in the forest. It had him totally spooked. The witness stated none of them wanted to walk near the road side brush. All were afraid of being grabbed by one of the creatures escorting them out of the woods. ",
