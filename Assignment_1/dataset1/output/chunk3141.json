            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on April 4, 2014.  She was motivated to share this report after learning about the BFRO on TV.  The event happened more than 40 years ago but made a significant impact on the witness and her husband.  They later moved from the area and have not been in these woods since this happened.I can add some detail to her report. The couple was walking happily along a trail in the early afternoon on a warm, sunny day.  There were no other hikers seen.  They were caught completely off guard with the sudden powerful sounds that came from behind trees at their 10 o'clock position about 50 feet away.  It was described as very close.The thump-thump-thump and screech-scream were amazingly loud.  The thumps could be felt and heard.  Witness believes the thumps were footsteps.  The scream was described as a woman shrieking but with deeper undertones with the intensity of a siren.  There were no unusual smells remembered.  They did not see what made the sounds.  The experience lasted about 10-15 seconds.Witness and husband immediately turned away and ran three miles back to the ranger station where they recounted their experience to the ranger.  Both were confident it was not a bear or coyote based on their experience with these animals. Witness comments that there were no other reports from the area.  Over the years there have in fact been numerous similar encounters and visual sightings of sasquatch on public and private land on both sides of the Mississippi in the region.  Some have not been published per request of the witnesses.",
