It is about 20' above the corn patch, a small spawning creek another 100' further back into the woods.The soil conditions did not lend itself well in holding tracks, and a neighbor decided to kick at the track before N.B. was able to take a picture of it. She gave me the picture and an enlargement of it. It is very difficult to make out clearly in the photo.This is the area where a tape was made by L.W., which sounds very similar to the Puyallup recordings. That was back in 1988, just down the road. The area has changed but not much.",
