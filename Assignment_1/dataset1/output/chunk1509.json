I've spent a lot of time living in the mountains. I've heard all sorts of animals, but never anything like this.''\"The day after we heard the noise, one of the dogs came back to the yard with something big in her mouth that looked like poop. It was huge. It had hair in it. The smell was really bad. It was really big. I tried to get it out of her mouth with a stick, but she just growled at me. It was definitely a huge poop. It was more like a horse smell than a human smell, but it was definitely not horse poop. The outside almost looked like Slim Jims, like it had a real thin skin. Something about it had that look to it, as if someone was stuffing a sausage.\"\"My two dogs are normally very aggressive. When they hear noises, like coyotes, they go chasing off into the woods. So when we heard this noise, I thought, where in the world are the dogs? They must be out in the woods. But when I took a quick peek out the window, I saw them both at the door huddled together. I was very surprised at that. They bark at even the littlest noises, then when there's something really loud, they're right by the door.\"\"So I brought them in the house, and about 10 minutes later, one of dogs started looking at the door from the living room, tilting her head side to side, and growling.\"The witness estimated the vocalization came from the direction of a large pile of dirt that was pushed up in the front yard. She said they checked for tracks, but found none.She also mentioned there were a number of broken trees in the area that were snapped at about the six-foot level. She said she will reexamine the breaks to see if twisting forces were involved.",
