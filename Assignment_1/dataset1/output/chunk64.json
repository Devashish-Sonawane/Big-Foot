            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone. The events listed above all happened in the same area and each activity occurred in September to early October. Each event also was in the time frame of three to five o clock in the afternoon. I will list the events in a timeline.The witness believes it was sometime in September of 2006 on a sunny day when he heard grunts and tree shaking. It happened twice about seventy five yards away in the creek bottom. Each lasted for about 3 seconds. He described the grunts as a deep woo - woo. No branch breaks were heard. Two years later while with his dad they heard raspy, heavy breathing. It was very close and continued even as they left the area. The witness said it was different than bear sounds. A few years later, he had a one inch rock land on the road twelve to fifteen feet from him. He then saw a second rock come from uphill and hit the canopy of his truck. No one else was around. In 2015, while with his wife, they heard wood knocks less than fifty yards away. One knock each from three different directions. They listened for ten to fifteen minutes then left. In 2018 he found the fifteen inch impression. It was difficult to determine if it was a Bigfoot track (see pictures.)The witness sometimes is in this area in the spring and summer but has not had any activity during these seasons. We discussed that Bigfoot may return to this area in the fall. He said there are many blackberries, and September through the first freeze is good for mushrooms. No foul odor was detected during these episodes. The witness is not aware of any caves in the area.   ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "3/29/16 I contacted the witness over the phone. I asked her to give me more details about what she has observed at the site. This witness is Native-American. She is Navajo. She is living at the site, which is an RV park, in a large motorhome. There is an open area where there is a 5-acre grassy field, a lodge building, and RV parking. To the east of this open area is about 20 acres of forest.The witness told me of the following:They moved there September 2015.She takes walks along the many trails, and at one point she said that the woods just felt \u0093Off\u0094.She found a clearing, where she said it just had a weird feeling.Last October 2015 she and her daughter heard a loud laughing/cackling sound very early in the morning.They hear strange \u0093calls\u0094 late at night (11:00-12:00) and early in the morning (4:00-7:00). (Possible barred-owl)They hear yells.She said that she and her daughter-in-law (different person than her daughter) took a walk in the forest, and it became very quiet: no bird sounds at all. They found a place that looked like a nest. It was a pile of brush that appeared to have a hole down at the bottom where something could go in.Sometimes at night they feel like something is watching them and following them.They hear knocking at night.There is a refrigerator that is outdoors, they close it and place a large garbage can in front of it, then often find the can moved and that the refrigerator has been opened and left ajar. Her dogs and cat often freak out and bark at something outside.The most active month for these occurrences was October.On April 1st, my wife Susan and I went to visit the site and interview the witness in person.We talked with this witness while at her RV. She pointed out where the various reported activities happened. Then the we walked the forest trails. Where I observed the following:A stick structure in the form of a tri-pod. Several impressions and possible tracks.Several stick-glyph formations.Note: when the BFRO photo/files server is back up, I will be able to add photos of the stick structure, impressions, and stick-glyphsIt is likely there are sasquatch which live in those woods, at least seasonally. I have attempted to make a couple of more trips to the location, but during the summer weekends, the property is usually occupied by some special event. I will be arranging to go out there later this fall, after all the human activity has died-down. If this is like other wooded locations around the more settled lowlands of the area, then I expect activity to resume in October.",
