            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness the evening of 10/31/06.  He heard a rustle from a nearby hill to the east and out of the corner of his eye saw movement.  He looked to see a large rock that made contact with branches as it flew toward the lake.  The rock flew 10 feet or more above him then hit the water 10 to 15 feet out from shore.  It was hard for him to judge the distance and point of origin because he saw the rock in flight but it came from the upslope side of a hill just to the east of the spillway. He quessed that it came from about 100 yards away but that is only a very rough estimate although he did say it was much farther than he could have thrown a rock that size.  He didn't hear or see anything else while he was fishing but about an hour later smelled a strong odor.Also mentioned were the night time vocalizations heard by him and his father, both experienced hunters and familiar with animal sounds. This was the same weekend and matching the description from posted sound report #12795 \"Vocalizations heard at Woods Canyon Lake\".",
