            "Follow-Up Report": "The location of this report is within the township of Spring Arbor, but outside the Village of Spring Arbor. The township is located southwest of Jackson and consists of rolling terrain, farms, lakes, wetlands and woods. Spring Arbor Township is known for its artesian water springs which form several of the lakes, creeks and rivers near the location, of which Lime Lake and Spring Arbor Lakes are, but just two of them. There are numerous corn and soybean farm plots in all directions, along with a cattle farm just east of this location. The surrounding farm lands provide food sources for a varied assortment of wildlife; ex: (Canadian geese, ducks, deer, squirrels, raccoons, etc.), while the lakes, creeks & rivers are teeming with crayfish, fish, turtles, etc.South of the report\u0092s location is the Falling Waters Trails, a 10.5 mile \u0093rails to trails\u0094 project, which runs East North East to West South West, connecting the city of Jackson to the Village of Concord. Though this trail crosses several county roads, it is otherwise secluded along the majority of its route and runs directly thru Lime Lake. During the day, bikers, walkers & joggers can be seen up & down the trail, while at night the trail is closed, thus affording a degree of seclusion along its route.============================================================My initial phone contact with the witness was cut short due to his busy schedule and we made arrangements to speak later in the week. When we finally spoke over the phone, I found out that my witness, a truck driver who lives in the state of Iowa, was in the Spring Arbor area delivering used grain from a brewery to a cattle farm east of this location. The witness stated that he has made this trip several times prior to that day\u0092s delivery.The witness explained that as usual, he arrived at the farm a couple of hours prior to sunrise and stopped his truck near the east entrance to the farm to undo the turnbuckles on the trailer\u0092s gate. This entrance, a dirt path leading to the concrete pad where he is to dump the grain also leads to the barn housing the cattle on the property. Upon arrival, the witness normally turns on the lights at the rear of the trailer to supplement the little bit of light coming from the street light on the property north of where he stops. As he went to the rear of the trailer to undo the turnbuckles, he heard a lot of noise coming from the bushes off to his right. The noise sounded like something was pacing back and forth, snapping branches and thrashing about with them and the witness stated he could sense a feeling of frustration, or maybe that of impatience. He also remembers a smell; a rank putrid smell coming from the west side of the road, possibly from within the bar-ditch. The witness, as he was undoing the turnbuckles was initially a little nervous about all that was going on, till the noise on the east side of the road grew in intensity, eventually causing him to run back to the cab of his truck and head up the drive to the concrete pad. Once the grain was dumped onto the concrete pad, the witness returned to the road and exited his truck to secure the turnbuckles and immediately noticed that all feelings of uneasiness and intimidation that he previously experienced was now gone, as well as the odor. The witness made note that he is not the type to be easily spooked, but something occurred causing him to experience something that was out of the ordinary.============================================================It was early fall when I first visited the site, it was then that I noticed that this area, this road, could easily be picked up and transported to anywhere in the state of Michigan and not seem out of place. This was your typical road, one out of countless thousands that bisect many townships and farm fields within our state, lined by trees that overhang the road, vines hanging down from the trunks & branches of those trees and thick, impassable walls of brush lining the roadway. There is nothing unusual or out of the ordinary about this particular stretch of road, but, as I delved deeper into this location, I found that you can\u0092t judge a book, nor a location, by its cover.After walking up and down looking at both side of the road, I headed off the road to the east side and found that if I wound my way through a narrow cleft in the brush, I found an opening, a \u0093clearing, if you will,\u0094 within all the tangled brush, only a few yards behind those overhanging trees, dangling vines and overgrown brush that line the road. A near perfect blind within a few feet of the road and out of sight to any casual passerby.This clearing did not have a natural look to it. There were branches & trunks of small trees lying on the ground, pressed somewhat into the dirt, providing a barrier between the soil and anyone walking around. There was room to walk about and with the natural wall of foliage between the clearing and the road a measure of security was easily afforded to anyone within the \u0093clearing\u0094. Though this clearing could easily be a construct by a group of adventurous kids, its much bigger than what a few kids might carve out. And with only one house near and the farm a \u00bd mile away, this area isn\u0092t being overrun by kids seeking their new hideout. After a careful search, I was unable to locate any evidence of anything living there recently, thou this may be a layover area for someone passing through the area, since some of the weeds and brush were trampled down, but still green and growing. There were no obvious prints, no carcasses of any type of animals were seen, and no obvious bedding areas were found. ============================================================The description of breaking limbs, the thrashing sounds in the brush, the overwhelming feeling of intimidation, the putrid smell in the bar ditch on the other side of the road and then the suddenness of it all being over, these are all typical behaviors that have been previously associated with a sasquatch encounter. After listening to the witness as he re-lived the events of that morning and then visiting the site to find a clearing in the area that the witness reported hearing the limbs breaking, a thrashing about and the sound of something large pacing back and forth lends credence to what I believe the witness experienced that day.
