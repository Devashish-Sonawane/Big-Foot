            "Follow-Up Report": "On the afternoon of 16 July 2008 Z.M. called me, and we went over his report that he and his girlfriend experienced at Lake Hemet, California, about eight years ago. The witness was credible and believable in the rendition of his report. At the time of this experience, neither witness thought about whatever it was as being a possible Sasquatch, but more like a bear.Some of the things that I thought might be important in this report are the following; just what kind of feelings did they have and when, and just what was it that you smelled and how potent was it? Also, what kind of trash was in that trash bin, and just how large was the bin that was knocked over?  What started this episode was the noise that this creature was making while it was heading down the mountain towards the parking area where the witness and the trash bins were located. It was moving rocks and small boulders, and braking tree and brush limbs in a very defiant manner as it moved on down the mountain. As soon as it reached the area where the trees were no longer hiding it, which was about 300 ft away from the witness' location, it stopped, and everything got real quiet. That is when they believed whatever it was had to have seen them, and that\u0092s when the feelings of being watched hit them both hard.  The smell hit them a few seconds later. This smell was something like a dead wet dog, but as they breathed it in, the smell choked them up, and they knew at that moment that they had to leave this place now!On there return trip about an hour or so later, and parking at the same location, they both observed one of those large trash bins, about the size of a jeep or a small pickup, that was knocked over with a large dent in its side.  Some of the contents were laying around. What the witness thought was in this trash bin were what the grounds-keeping people had put in there.  He didn\u0092t see anything that he would call human trash like food containers and such, but only tree and bush clippings plus many pine cones. Also, the trash bins didn\u0092t stink as most bins normally do.What this witness described, has a lot of the trappings of a Sasquatch, by what took place and what was observed by this witness. He now believes it was a Sasquatch. This place might have some bears, but even if it was a bear, they just do not grow them very large in this part of California now, especially as to what this witness described this creature was doing and able to do.

            "Follow-Up Report": "On 4/29/01, I met with Diane, her friend and three dogs near the site of the sighting at noon. We walked into the area without her dogs; past the spot were she saw the animal standing. I then asked them to leave me there and go get their dogs. I made sure to ask if I was running a chance of being attacked and they said I would be fine as long as I didn't jump out of the woods unexpectedly. The dogs reacted to me just as Diane described they would.I found two small deer tracks, one large elk track, lots of human tracks and garbage, a small Western Toad (Bufo boreas), several black and bright yellow centipedes and threeCaponotus laevigatus (Giant Carpenter Ant) hills.We found coyote, and deer scat along the road and a short distance into the woods.No recent human occupation of the site was evident (cig butts, wrappers, cans, bottles, fresh tracks, etc). I do not believe that a homeless person had been in the area. There were very sharp sticker bushes of various types all over the area. They went right through my thick pants.We noticed two of these anthills on the trip into the area. They were 2' high by 4' in diameter. The whole surface was moving and trails of ants led off into all directions; down the road, into the woods, etc.These type of ants are black and red, 5/8\" long, inhabiting dead woody debris at the base of live trees, felled logs, timber or poles. Inside these nests are brood chambers housing eggs, larvae and pupae inside silken pupal cases. They are not like termites; they eat other insects, honeydew and other plant matter. They are part of the first stages of breaking down organic compounds into humus.On the trip back out Diane walked ahead of us with the dogs and I noticed at one spot along the road that a fresh trail was visible. At the same time Diane's friend said that he smelled something. There was a wind and a couple of times I too could smell what I would call a weak skunk smell. On the trail heading west off the road there were broken leaves and stems from the Salal bushes, some turned over, standing out easily from the others. The ground was covered in moss but large scuffmarks were visible. There were also fallen branches that had been stepped on and broken. The trail width was about 18\" wide. This trail was easy to follow for a short distance into the forest. I found an area where an animal had bedded down for the area was clear of debris and compressed. It was under a tree that had very low hanging branches (maybe 2' off the ground at most).Walking back to the road, we did not smell anything else. I alone walked the found trail into the woods.Coming up to the spot where Diane said she first saw the animal standing in the forest next to a tree we stopped and I walked into the woods and with her direction discovered that the animal she saw was at least 1'5\" to 2' feet taller than me standing in the same spot. I am 6'1\".Walking back out to the road, I had to go past one of the anthills we found in the area. On the back of this ant hill was what appeared to be either a partial four toed track or knuckle marks and what might be a knee impression. These marks were in the outer area of the anthill but the ants looked like they were repairing the area. I made a shoe imprint the same distance into the hill for Diane and her friend to see how long it took to disappear the next time they came out to the area.The impression found is described as being of four large toe shapes, evenly spaced, 1.5\" wide x 2\" long and 1\" deep. A ridge ran along these toes and either a palm like surface or foot ball was evident opposite this ridge, 8\" wide x 6\" long and again 1\" deep. The outside of this palm or ball looked as if a possible double ball or thumb may have been present as well. The toes were in a straight line but angled to the length of the impression, possibly 45 degrees. In line with this imprint, was another impression looking much like a knee, dish or scoop shaped, 10\" wide x 6-8\" long and 3\" deep, 12\" away.I took 645cm BW pictures with and without a 25A red filter hoping to lighten up the area. I am not sure how they will turn out since the whole area was covered in moving ants and it was dark enough that I had to use a slow shutter speed. I chose not to use a flash. I took pictures with and without Diane pointing close by the impression giving good scale to the anthill and impression. I marked the area on GPS and as it started to rain we left the area.I drove to other regions nearby that have had activity reported and noticed large areas of 8' tall scotch broom bushes that had recent trails going through them. These trails were several feet in width.This area is under a Human influence scale (modified from Bishop et al. 1981) rated as:Home Range 2Harassment 1Hunted 1Habituation 2Predators 3I am 80% certain that the impression found in the ant hill is in fact a track of a foot or of knuckles and I found no discrepancies with Diane's account of the incident. Seeing only the legs while retreating back to the car troubled me until I too looked back to the site area and saw the low height of the understory and realized that I was now at a slightly higher elevation.Site elevation was 611'.",
