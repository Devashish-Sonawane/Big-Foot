He said he was crawling thru the mines, digging too. Spent the day exploring.  Driving about 10 mph, he was about 1 1/2 miles from the mines when the rock bounced off and he saw it land next to the truck. Google earth image of the location:It struck his truck hard, denting it.Photo of the dent along with the actual rock that made it:Photo of the rock next to a baseball for size comparison:Angry and thinking some kids were \u0093messing with him,\u0094 he stopped the truck and got out.  He noticed it was unusually quiet. Seeing a dark shadow moving in the woods which he thought was the rock thrower, he went into the woods to confront them.  He walked about 100 yards into the woods and saw nothing \u0096 no people, tracks or even animals. He is an avid hunter and the unusual quiet gave him a \u0093creepy feeling\". He realized that the rock thrower wasn\u0092t a kid \u0093messing with him\".  The area is part of Lost Creek State Park.",

She and my brother in law just bought a double-wide w/ 3+ acres of wooded and swamp surroundings. I visited her the first weekend she started moving in, and I personally heard and felt a large and Very Heavy Running sound on her front Porch the night I visited. She just told me on the phone, that they are hearing on a regular basis, Screaming and Howling and a Definite Fowl Skunky/Rotten Smell. My nephew has said he has seen Something BIG squatting down in the evening across the property near the Storage Barn. Our Elderly Father lives with her, and Dad heard the screaming/howls this weekend and went out the Back Side Porch, just in time to See What he calls an Adult Sasquatch running across the Fenced pasture. She sent me a Photo last week of a HUGE Prominate Deep Print from her front yard w/a small Print right next to it. I saved This Photo on my phone, I will share it with ya'll. Her new home was empty for over 1.5 years, and I believe there might be a family of squatches living in the swamp and deep woods surrounding her home. Thank You",
