            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with both witnesses by phone. Apparently, to the witnesses, this daytime sighting is the most dramatic in a long running series of events. The husband had the closest and longest look at the creature, although he could only see it from the mid torso up. He described its build as broad and muscular, three to four feet across the shoulders, and between six and seven feet tall. The entire body was covered with long, reddish brown hair.  The husband described the head shape as being pointed toward the back. No ears were visible. Hair covered the face \"like a man with a beard\"; the hair was thinner around the eyes and on the forehead. The eyes were large and dark in color. The mouth was described as wide, with thick, dark lips. The nose was broad and flat. Overall the face did not project forward in a muzzle, but was \"flat like a person or a monkey\".After the couple went up the hill away from the creature it apparently followed them at a distance. Approximately a week later, at dusk, the wife was in the back yard when \"the dogs went crazy barking\". She then saw a creature \"just standing\" in the woods about seventy five to one hundred feet away. She described this creature as having a more blondish brown hair and did not think it was the same individual she and her husband had seen earlier.The rock throwing incident occurred in the same area of the sighting. The husband heard a noise at the top of the ridge and looked up to see a rock \"about the size of a football\" hit the top of a tree near him and bounce downhill. \"About four years ago\", during the summer, the husband was ginseng hunting in the company of his father and brother. They heard what sounded like \"Chinamen talking\" from one hill to another, then a sound like a tree falling. They then quickly left the area.The wife also related that they had found several trees over the years twisted off, \"like you'd wring out a washcloth\" at a level above human head height.",
