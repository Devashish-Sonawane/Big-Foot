He immediately got up and closed, then locked his window.Witness describes wood knocks as an echoing, hollowed sound. States the vocalization he heard was more of a whoop that bellowed and echoed as well. Did not hear any further noises as he closed the window. Witness did not go out in daylight to investigate for any physical/tangible signs of what may have caused these sounds.He has lived in the Buckley area for >30yrs; and has been an avid hunter, fisher, and camper for >40yrs. He states he is able to discern different animal calls, howls, and growls related to his outdoor/hunter experience. And this whoop was a sound he had never heard before.This region has the White River running through it. Heavily forested and with adequate food supplies, running the northern side of Rainier.",
