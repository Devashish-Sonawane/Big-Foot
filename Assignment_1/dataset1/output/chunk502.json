            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness has been having late night visits since he moved into the rental property in March 2012. He is an avid fisherman, hunter and outdoorsman. He has large buckets of fish in his yard many days of the week, and traps small animals (for meat and pelts) in his backyard, which borders on a large area of forest. His first visitor was seen by his roommate as it was peering through the bedroom window. The witness was up, grabbed a rifle and ran out, thinking it was a burglar. As he rounded the house, it was tearing across the backyard, he could hear the heavy footfalls. It then jumped a 5 ft fence and barreled through extremely thick swamp, breaking branches and howling/screaming. This shook the witness as he knew this was no man. When the roommate saw it again a few night later, he could see it was a large, hairy upright thing as it put its arm up to block the outside flood light from its eyes to better peer into the window. The roommate moved out, and another moved in. This new room mate was not told of the visitor so he wouldn't be predisposed to seeing something. But within a few days, the hairy thing was back. This new roommate saw it looking at him in the night, and moved out in just a few days. This is about when we got the report.We arrived the night after a raccoon was taken from a snare in his backyard. Whatever took it, broke a 250 lb. fishing wire to get it. The other half of the wire was still attached to the fence post. He showed us turtle shell fragments that had been broken over his fence post so they could be eaten. We also saw a cell phone photo of a print he had taken a few months prior (the photo was poor quality so it is not included in this report). He found it under a window in the front yard. He said it measured 14.5 inches, and another print 43\" away.We set up a small tent in his backyard facing the fence where he said they watched them during bonfires. When they smoked fish during these bonfires, the activity surged. After 2 hours, at 11:00 pm, we noticed two images that seemed to be hiding behind trees, peering at us. These were only the top portions as the fence was covered in thick vegetation that obscured the lower 5 ft. These images, seen thru the FLIR PS32 thermal imager, moved in and about the trees on the other side of the fence. They were also seen to move sideways. I could see two heads, a set of shoulders and an arm moving behind a tree. We watched these images for appx 2 minutes before they finally backed away from the fence and disappeared from view. This area is thick with vegetation. These images were seen by myself, my wife, and the witness. After retiring to our tent at 1:00 am, we slept with no further incidents. The next morning, we checked for any prints left behind at the fence, but the ground was rocky and not conducive to footprint evidence.  This Flir unfortunately does not record.We will keep in close contact with this witness.  His fear has turned to curiosity, and he doesn't want any harm to come to these animals. This will be an ongoing investigation.",
