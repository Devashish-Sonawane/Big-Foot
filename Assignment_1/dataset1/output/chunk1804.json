            "Follow-Up Report": "[Comments written by Harold Benny, B.G. Martin, and Matt Moneymaker]I met M. L. (father) and R. L. (daughter) on the BFRO's 2008 Missouri expedition; they were also there with B.L. (mother). Their family was warm and inviting to everyone on the expedition and they became fast friends with everyone. They attended the Oklahoma 2008 expedition as well.M.L. (the father) is 47 years old. He hasn\u0092t hunted for the past 15 years because he\u0092s been involved with running the family business, but he is a hunter who has hunted everything you can hunt in southern Illinois. R.L. is 21 years old and works at the family business. M.L and R.L. wanted to use what they learned from the BFRO expedition and try out some locations in their areas that seemed to be good habitat. The first night they used some luring techniques they learned on the expeditions and nothing happened. The second night they did the same but they also cooked bacon at their camp. That was the night they noticed one quietly observing them as they left. M.L. was walking along and he noticed eye shine to his left. He told his daughter to step back to him which was only 2 steps back. They both saw eye shine from something that was positioned on the down side of an incline below them. They both watched it as it watch them, which was about 10 seconds in duration. During that time it blinked its eyes once, turned its head quickly to the right which was to look to the northwest. R.L. said she could see the profile of its eye when its head was turned while it reflected her light.Both them decided to turn off their head lamps off at the moment the unknown visitor moved and took 4 to 6  \u0093slow and deliberate steps\u0094 further down the hill away from them. Just before it moved both of them said for a split second they could see the silhouette of the top half of its head against the horizon. Both agreed that its head was round like a human. They couldn\u0092t see if it had hair clearly, but it appeared more textured than smooth.It stopped, and they couldn\u0092t see any eye shine. Both their lights were off and R.L. mentioned that it could have been behind some tree. At that point, R.L. started to speak to it in a calm and comforting manner. When she began to first speak she heard it move. She didn\u0092t know if it took a step or shuffled its foot but either way it didn\u0092t move much. While R.L. was speaking softly M.L. had the urge to look around specifically to the northwest. He didn\u0092t use his light but remembered from the BFRO expeditions that investigators had told them that in most cases if there was one BF in the brush watching a clearing, there was often another nearby, observing the same clearing from a different angle.She spoke to if for a few minutes and after 5 minutes they decided to leave. The reason R.L. said they left was, it seemed like they had reached a \u0093standoff\u0094 and they didn\u0092t want to provoke it in to doing something that made it uncomfortable. They didn\u0092t leave because they were afraid and they didn\u0092t hear it move anymore during the short walk to their vehicle. I asked M.L. what about the encounter made it apparent that the figure was not a human. He said the eyes were further apart than a human, and the eyes were much larger. I asked him to use something as a comparison to gage the eye size; he said the eyes were comparable to the size of a golf ball. He also added that when it walked its strides were much longer than a person\u0092s. The way he was able to tell this was by the sound of its foot falls, \u0091the time in between strides was long\u0092. He said he could clearly hear that it was bipedal and hear it \u0093thud\u0094 when it stepped.When they went back the next day to gauge the distance, they determined it was from 30 \u0096 45 feet away. They weren\u0092t able to locate any tracks and there was no snow on the ground. Because what they experienced was in part auditory, M.L. walked where they saw and heard it. R. L. said compared to the night before M.L. sounded a lot lighter and smaller, he\u0092s 250 lbs. They both agreed that it was between 6 and 7 feet tall, and that the movements they saw weren\u0092t rapid or edgy, but it seemed comfortable around them. They didn\u0092t notice any unusual odors or smells during the encounter.R.L. remarked that she first heard a strange howl that triggered the coyotes in the area to start sounding off. She said the strange howl was in the direction of the coyotes so she couldn\u0092t be sure if there was something other than a coyote. She mentioned this to her father but he said it was probably a coyote but she said his hearing isn\u0092t very good, he worked in a noisy factory for 15 years._____________________________________________BFRO members have noticed a pattern regarding coyotes. After the 2000 Skookum Meadows Expedition it was suggested that sasquatches may have a symbiotic hunting relationship with coyotes, similar to the symbiotic hunting relationship human hunters have had with dogs for thousands of years. Due to the particular characteristics of sasquatch predation on deer, which was first noticed by the BFRO in the mid-1990's (i.e. removing the liver and a few other soft organs, then discarding the rest of the carcass), a symbiotic relationship with coyotes would work because sasquatches discard most of the meat on the deer they kill. Sasquatches can also fight off any aggressive male bucks that would defend a young deer. Coyotes, on the other hand, might be helpful at sniffing out deer beds and generally keeping tabs on them as they migrate through the landscape. _________________________________________________As they were driving home M.L. had the idea to check the vehicle to see if anything had left any marks on the vehicle. He had heard that on some expeditions peoples\u0092 vehicles have had marks left on them that otherwise weren\u0092t there before. They were surprised when they arrived home that they found three areas where something had touched the SUV and disturbed the grime on the vehicle. R.L. said that at 3:00 pm that day she was sure there weren\u0092t any marks on the SUV because she was checking the vehicle for nicks or bumps after being in their business parking lot.  Weeks earlier someone had dinged their vehicle when it was in Walmart\u0092s parking lot. While checking the vehicle she made a mental note that the SUV needed a wash.  Below is the original photo, it\u0092s the best of three photos showing marks on the SUV. The 2nd image is the same image but modified by turning the contrast up to highlight the marks. The mystery prints are above the Explorer emblem. M.L. intentionally left some marks to the left of Ford badge as a size comparison.",
