            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness in a telephone interview and can include the following information.  The witness knew the exact time of day as she checks the progress of her commute to work with various landmarks along her way.  She had a good field of view, but daylight was still somewhat limited.  As she got closer she recalled seeing a large leg with a knee.  She recalled clearly seeing a knee and focused her attention on that part of the anatomy.  She recalled the leg and knee rising up and crossing over the log.  She said it was tall and was out of sight very quickly.  She described the creature to be black in color and the covering was more like hair than fur.  Her husband went to the location and attempted to search for any signs of tracks, but the area was heavily covered with pine needles and leaf litter.  The witness expressed concern about feeding her own animals in the dark or in the predawn hours.  I addressed the witness' concerns and advised her what to look and more importantly what to listen for.  I found the witness to be credible and sincere in all accounts of her event.I classified this as a Class B only because of the lack of physical characteristics normally associated with a Sasquatch.  It is a high probability that the witness observed a Sasquatch preoccupied with something in the road.  The area has a rich history of sightings and this region of Texas contains several National and State Parks that include vast forests, large reservoirs, numerous streams and abundant wildlife.  BFRO has conducted several expeditions in the region and the area of the witness sighting was recently profiled on an episode of Finding Bigfoot.",
