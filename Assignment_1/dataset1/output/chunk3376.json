            "Observed": "I don't like talking about these things because, # 1 I don't believe in it and # 2 I do now. On Wednesday, April 8th, 2009 my cousins cows got out, which was located in Godfrey, Il. which is in Madison County. So I was walking in the woods up the road from their house about deep in to three acres of land and I cross this large valley and went up the hill and half way up I got winded. So I stop to catch my breath and as I rested against the tree I looked to the west from where I was standing to see if I could see any cows moving, which I did not. so I looked to the east and I saw a large man looking thing moving to the north in which as he walked tree limbs were breaking. Believe me I would be willing to take a lie detector test on this. This is the most shaking thing I ever seen. This thing had long black hair and very shaggy.  Thank you for your time.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "* I spoke with Larry W. who saw the creature standing under his security yard light.Larry described the scenery as being timber area with a group of evergreens in his yard around his yard light. He stated, he had heard screams and noises coming from his Alfalfa field and the coons dogs were barking and crying. He opened the patio door to tell the dogs to be quiet. He stated, it was 30 degrees outside and when he opened the patio door he heard a wisp, woof, woof sound that scared him and he went in search of his rifle slugs for protection. Larry stated, he was up 15 to 16 feet above ground, inside his home, when he looked towards his security yard light and saw a creature walk in front of the light. He estimated the distance from the creature to his window to be approximately 150 feet. The creature was heavy, with a fluid grace, with arms swinging, hands went head high as it proceeded down his driveway. Larry noticed the dogs went quiet when the creature was in his yard. He couldn't tell what colour it was, but believes it was dark and had a slight hump on it's back.Larry called the sheriff and both of them went to look for it. They found tracks in the frost that measured 48\" apart. The clothes line poles were 6'3\" to 6\"5\". Larry estimates the creature was taller then the poles. He stated, in this area their are gopher mounds that have tunnels underground and near one gopher hole was the front part of a big human foot.* I spoke with the person who had told a friend he had seen the same creature sleeping on the floor of a cabin that had no roof.The witness stated, that after so long a time he could not remember exactly what he had seen and therefore he did not want to relate his story. He said it was really dark that night and it is hard to remember what he saw.* I spoke with Dale D. about his sighting of two creatures he saw walking along a fence.Dale stated, he had been out working late in the evening trying to get his farming done before freezing. He was driving his tractor home, it was 11:30 p.m. and it was snowing lightly. Dale stated, he saw something moving but never thought to stop his tractor. He saw two \"beings\" walking down the property line, in a clear part of a timber area. They were walking \"side by side\". One of them was described as being bulky and so... big. The other one was smaller, slightly hunched over. Dale's thoughts at the time were, \"what are people doing out at this time of night\". Then he noticed they appeared to be furry and walked with a long gait, swinging their arms. They walked along the fence line up and along the timber and disappeared into the timber. Dale estimated the two of them were 100 feet from the road and all he could see were their silhouettes. Dale stated, the fence posts were four feet high and estimated the tallest creature as being seven to eight feet tall. Still to this day, Dale is amazed at what he saw and counts himself as very fortunate to have seen them.* I spoke with Russ D. about the vocalization sounds that he and his mother heard while he was working away in his farm shop. Russ stated, he was really surprised by his dogs running away, as they had never done that before. He also stated, he can still remember the vocalization sounds he and his mother heard and will never forget them. Russ and his brother Dale are really excited and amazed by the sighting reports in their area, especially these sighting reports as they all happened within days of each other and they were themselves a part of.Russ contacted me after he read one of the BFRO's sighting reports on our website and he felt it was time he reported them to someone who would believe in him. He also wanted to know if anyone else had encountered anything unusual in this same time frame?I would like to extend my special thanks to Russ D., as he was the one that helped me to contact witnesses and connect the sighting reports together.",
