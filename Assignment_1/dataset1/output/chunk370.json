During the interview, he also described hearing low moans that he could actually feel in his chest. There were no sounds heard during the rock throwing incidents. Witness also noted that there are no campsites or hiking trails in the area. The area is rich in wildlife and vegetation. It consists of hardwoods, cedar, cypress, bamboo and is thickly weeded.Witness also submitted a report back in 2000, that occurred on Eglin Air Force Base, refer to Report #9113.",

At first I though it was a horse. Then a bear. It did not have a natural gait and the body was too thin to be a horse and it was too tall to be a bear.  As I closed up on it I saw that it had dark brown hair that was several inches long. The head was smaller than a horse or a bear. I believe it to be a bigfoot on all fours. I had slowed down and stopped where I thought it had gone into the woods. It was very thick at this point.  Standing, it would probably be 9 feet tall from my opinion.",
