It was middle of summer and the Mosquitoes were really bad so I decided to wait until after dark to go because they usually calm down after sunset. I had been fishing awhile with no luck when I started noticing something moving in the edge of the water, it was a river otter. I had never seen one before so I just sat and watched it for awhile. It was eating something maybe crawfish or muscles, I'm not sure but it was there for quite awhile. While watching it I started noticing large yellow eyes that I assumed was an owl. I would just catch a glimpse of them and when I would turn to look at them they would disappear. This went on for 30-45 minutes. All of a sudden the otter shot away from the bank and I saw something grey move from behind a bush to behind a cedar tree. The distance it covered was about 15 feet and it did it in a second and made no noise. I didn't get a clear look it happened so quick, but whatever it was was big (if it was a side view like I assume from the direction of travel it was thick maybe 2 foot). Within 3-4 seconds after disappearing behind the cedar tree something big hit the water about 5 feet from the end if the dock where I was sitting and a fear came over me like nothing I've felt before. I grabbed my stuff, threw it in the truck and left as fast as I could.",

The witness felt that a large object had been thrown in the water and that it was not caused by a beaver or otter. Here are the photos he took of the tracks, with the little detail seen its hard to form an opinion on what made them, but the opinion of this Investigator is that a bear made them. Bear in the area tells us that there is a wide variety of food sources present. ",
