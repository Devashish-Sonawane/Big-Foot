            "Observed": "I was lying in bed, trying to go to sleep, when I heard an unusual sound from outside through my partly-opened window.  It sounded like a cross between a person moaning, a dog howling, and a cat growling (the timbre was human-like and in human vocal range, it was a high-to-low pitch sound like a howl, and there was a hint of growliness underneath that sounded like an angry cat, but much larger).  It sounded almost like someone moaning \"booooooo\".  The \"b\" sound was faint, but definitely present.  Each vocalization was about 5-6 seconds in length, with about 5 seconds between each.  It didn't seem very loud, but it also was not faint.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for approximately twenty minutes about the incident. She struck me as honest and sincere. She is not certain of the exact date she heard the howls, but she is positive that it was sometime during October 2005. She described the sound as a \u0093moaning howl\u0094 somewhat similar to the \"Mississippi Howl\".  When I asked if it was possible that she could have mistaken the sound for that of a coyote, she was certain that what she heard was not a coyote as the sound was lower in pitch than that of a coyote. While she\u0092s heard some low-pitched coyote howls, she believes that what she heard could not have been a coyote due to \u0093the power behind it and the depth of the howl\u0094.  Each howl lasted only five to ten seconds but the witness  estimated that the animal vocalized close to thirty times in a ten minute period. Her initial impression was that whatever was making the noise could have been as close as her front yard, but as she moved to another part of the house, she could hear the howls \u0093echoing\u0094 around the neighborhood, so it was coming from much further away.Despite the fact that the witness lives in a developed area, there are patches of woods bordering her neighborhood. While she finds it hard to believe that a sasquatch would travel into a relatively populated area such as her neighborhood, she did say that she has seen various types of wild animals, as well as their signs, around her neighborhood, due to its proximity to the Cascade Mountains.
