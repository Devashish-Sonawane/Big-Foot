            "Observed": "Unfortunately, my sighting is not recent at all. It happened in the late 70's in a town called Flagler Beach on the east coast of Florida. At that time the area was still very rural and undeveloped. Myself and a group of other kids, I think a total of 8,were down a deseted open flat, a small peninsula,primarily used for nesting birds. This is late morning under a clear sky in August I should add.  We were near one of the banks when I \"felt\" something. I look across the water to a hill (approx 200 yds away) covered with course brown grass with a tree stump at the top. Seeing nothing else I went on with whatever we were doing but it occured to me that the \"tree stump\" was very much out of place on that hill. I look again and \"it\" has moved downhill closer to us. Realizing it was much taller and moving I pointed it out to the others, turned to see if they looked, when suddenly everyone bolted. Since the older brothers ran I too took off. About a mile later I finally asked why they ran and they said it moved it's head. To this day I still regret leaving. What description I can give is this: \"it\" was tall, 7 ft maybe. It appeared to covered in long brownish/grey fur and it did indeed stand upright. I call it a bigfoot because I am certain of what it WASN'T. Definitely not a bear and the liklihood of it being a human in a costume is extremely remote. My arguement there is one, Fla in August can be brutal even to the locals, damn near suicide to put on a heavy costume out in the sun. Two, the location. With the exception of the hill all else around was marshland, not very easy to get to. I know because I tried to at another time. Also as I stated it was very remote so the liklihood of a hoax at that time and place just doesn't add up.",

(2) Witness did not actually see it walk; however, did notice that it had moved closer.  (3) Witness did not smell or hear anything unusual.  (4) Witness emphasizes feeling of being watched.  (5) Other witnesses are either unreachable, have no recollection,  or are not willing to talk.  (6) Witness had another \"encounter\"(albeit vague) 2 miles south of this one.
