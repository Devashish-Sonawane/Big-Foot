We got there just before dark and had been there for several hours when it happened. The place where we were is on a large power transmission line right of way.There is a small stream that crosses the clearing, and a very steep hill on the side where we parked. In fact, so steep that it is difficult to drive a four wheel drive down to the stream. On the other side of the stream there is a low level spot that then becomes another steep hill. I would say that the hills are a good 50 feet higher than the stream.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I visited the area with the couple on Sunday, April 01, 2007. During the scouting of the area, two other details were determined. During the interview, the witness remembered that he could see a shadow moving on the slope below him after his wife got in his truck. There was the sound of brush breaking and being pushed down. The witness returned to the sight 3 days later and found pine saplings had been pulled up including the roots and thrown up slope in the direction of where he had been parked. Due to rains, there were no prints noted.The witness remembered times when the dogs used to run deer would either refuse to get out of the truck or would cease to chase deer and return to the trucks and try to get back in their boxes. He also remembered hunting with two other members who had placed two deer carcasses in a creek to keep cool until later in the day. When they returned to retrieve the deer, one of the carcasses was gone. The water level was too low and slow to have floated the dead deer away. He feels someone or something took the dead deer.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "As the witness stated in his report, I have met and talked with him in the past. He is a lifelong outdoorsman, and lived in the area his whole life. As a hunter and fisherman myself, when I talked with him, both in-person and over the phone recently, he knows what he is talking about when it comes to the wildlife of  Washington State. While I have not actually been to Chambers Lake, I attempted to get there late spring in 2012. Several of us were scouting for an expedition location. We got stuck in a patch of snow that was a bit deeper than I thought. There were hikers going in there, who parked below the snow, and they helped us dig out. One of our party, a female, was off in the woods about 100 yards away, when as she stood up, she saw a sasquatch watching her from about 75 yards away. She intentionally looked away, and then back, and it was gone, verifying that it was indeed there. I have been to the gravel pit that this witness refers to several times. Our family has an annual camping trip at the nearby lakes (Walupt, Horseshoe, or Takhlakh Lakes), so I am well familiar with the area. There are sasquatch sightings all over that area, and many reports over the years. This year, it is my intention to go camping at Chambers Lake to see what activity there may be. At this time, it is inaccessible due to snow. In addition to the accounts related in the report, this witness mentioned that in June of 2003, he was camping there with his daughters. At night, something was raining pinecones down on their tent. This would have been too early for squirrels to be harvesting pinecones so that would not be the cause. This behavior, throwing pinecones, pebbles, or sticks is consistent with other reports of sasquatch interaction.Due to the experiences this witness has had, he no longer hunts this area. ",
