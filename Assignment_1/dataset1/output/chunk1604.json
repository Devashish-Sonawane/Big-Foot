            "Observed": "It was Friday July 28,2006 at Salt Fork State Park in Cambridge Ohio. I was hiking with my dad, mom, 2 little sisters and my aunts niece. we have been into the whole bigfoot thing and decided that we would go hike and hopefully see him. well at about 6:30 pm or so we started hiking and had seen footprints. so we kept hiking hoping to see him, and as we were hiking i would here deep sounding grunts and out of the corner of my eye would see big dark figures moving. well we made it to the top of the hill which went to the road and my mom had told me that i would be to scared to walk back by myself so i did and my sister and cousin followed behind me. we started our way back into the woods and i ran down the hill and as i was waiting for my sister and cousin to make it down the hill, i got this feeling as if someone was watching me and i had got the goosebumps and there were no other sounds or animals around.it was about 7pm and i turned my head and saw a figure around the size of 8-10 feet tall on 2 legs, dark brown/black hair/fur and it had big yellowish eyes staring right at me. now i believe in bigfoot/sasquatch so i would say it was bigfoot. he was standing behind a big tree and was staring right at me with his big hand holding onto the tree. it was almost like he was peeking around the tree.i was so scared the i started walking faster and then into a run and my sister and cousin came running after me..... i stopped to catch my breath because i was crying n could hardly breath and looked over again and there he was again behind a rock. i had then told my sister that i had seen him and i thought he was following us. well my dad had told us if we see him to scream for him and run. well when i tried to scream nothing came out so we all ran about 2 miles back to our cabin. when we had gotten to the pavement my sister and cousin had came out and told me that they had seen him too but didn't tell me right away because they didn't want to scare me anymore. throughout our hike my sister and i heard grunts and would see tall figures but weren't positive of what they were.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness' by phone and the following can be added to this report.They describe the animal as muscular and between eight to ten feet tall. The color of the animal was a blackish brown, and the hair was long and mud covered. They further describe the eyes as yellowish in color with brown in the center. The nose was flat, and the skin was dark in color. No teeth were visible as the mouth was closed. They describe the neck as normal sized. Witness one was in a position to be able to add some information on the animal\u0092s hands. She describes them as big with five fingers. The legs were long, and they described the animal as having feet. The sighting lasted only about five seconds.  The animal was seen standing by witness number one and peeking around a tree. The second witness saw the animal walking and further describes the walk as faced paced with long strides. She also states that the animal was in the eight to ten foot ranges. They also found tracks that they describe as being larger than a size thirteen and a half shoe. They were unable to further describe the grunts that they heard. They did not take measurements as they were startled and left the area quickly. Both witnesses\u0092 estimate that they were about one hundred feet from the animal during the sighting, although from different angles. Their father states that he was less than five minutes behind them on the trail. He also commented on how quiet the woods were at the time. He also describes the condition of the girls upon returning, as \"whacked out of their minds and did not want to go back outside\".The area is in Salt Fork State Park where other sightings have occurred. This sighting was close to the location of BFRO report number 9188. It was less than a mile from that location. Salt Fork State Park is one of very few public parks in North America where park staff will usually speak openly about the number of reports in the area, including a very credible sightings on the edge of the parking lot for the main lodge. Salt Fork has a large lake, numberous caves, and abundant wildlife.",
