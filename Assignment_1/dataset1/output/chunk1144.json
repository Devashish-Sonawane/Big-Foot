            "Observed": "My fiance B. and I just got done watching a movie, when the dogs started barking, then within 5 minutes they got really quiet, and went into their dog houses.  We thought this was strange so we opened our back door toward where the dogs were barking at a few minutes before and saw something near our mineral feeder for the cows. We live on a farm so we had an unused mineral feeder in the back yard.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness on 21 April 2006. She stated the incident lasted approximately two minutes and happened around 10 PM. When the creature stood up, they immediately recognized it was not a bear. The height was about 7 feet, muscular built, covered with hair, and approximately 50 yards from the house.. The creature and witnesses stared at each other for a considerable time. Finally, it grunted and walked toward the woods. She said it grunted twice more after entering the woods.  The primary witness reported that she could smell a foul odor during the sighting. The creature walked with a purposeful stride swinging its arms and looking over its left shoulder until they lost sight of it. The witnesses looked at each other and asked, \u0093Did you see what I saw?\" After confirming the sighting, went inside as quickly as possible. They reported to have heard wood knocks during the fall.  The witness and her spouse occasionally take walks through the fields behind their house. Sometimes she has a feeling of being watched and at the same time there is a lack of normal animal sounds.  They have no knowledge of any lost livestock among their neighbors. UPDATE:Responded to the witness on September 12, 2008. She and her daughter were riding an ATV through their fields and noticed a deer stand was swaying from side to side. They were weaving between large rolls of hay from a recent harvest. Riding to an area where they could see the tower she discovered a large hair covered animal shaking the tree stand. It appeared to be between 8-9 feet tall, with dark colored hair. The animal saw them, and started running toward them. Her daughter was riding on back, was terrified by the situation and pounded her mother on the back yelling, \u0093I want to go home NOW!\u0094 They rode back home (about \u00bd mile) where the youngster jumped off the ATV before it stopped and ran inside the house. The adult witness stated her husband returned to investigate but found nothing. The area where the deer stand is located is surrounded by open fields. It is adjacent to a 2-3 acre woodlot they routinely refer to as the \u0093island.\u0094 She and her family occasionally walk the fields looking for birds and have heard wood knocks from the island.

Several days before the incident they smelled a very unpleasant odor. They assumed it was an animal carcass, but could not find the source of the smell. The daughter related the sighting took place about 30 minutes after the niece had gone outside. She was approximately 35 feet from the creature and her former boyfriend was much closer. The creature was over 6 feet tall with a very broad body, especially in the shoulders. The creature's face was \"between a monkey and a human\" in appearance and its hair was \"long and coarse, like a golden retriever,\" and white in color, \"like an old person\u0092s hair.\" The creature was standing on two legs and \"ran away on two legs like a human.\" ",
