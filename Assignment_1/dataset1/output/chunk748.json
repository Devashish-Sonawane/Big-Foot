I turned down the television and we listened at our open window and heard the sound again. It was an animal sound coming from the wooded areas around our house. I could only describe the sound as a monkey-like whooping sound. The animal made this series of whooping sounds only twice.The neighborhood dogs responded by barking. My husband quickly told me that he had heard unusual animal calls the night before while letting our dogs out in the yard.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I and a relative of mine met the witness and her husband at their home on Feb. 11, 2012 near Allatoona Lake. Both are graduates of a major research university with degrees in engineering and biology. Both were adamant that they were familiar with typical wildlife in the area and that the sounds were not those of coyotes. This area, while having undergone development, does contain numerous connected undeveloped acreage east and north of Allatoona reservoir. There have been other reports in the vicinity including near/on Interstate 75. It is possible that there was bigfoot activity in the area due to the sounds described as \"deep howl/whoop\" which occurred multiple times over a two month period. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness by phone.  The following details can be added to the report.--The witness lives very close to the Big Hill activity that occurred during the same time period as Report #3072.--The witness is a former youth leader, and will be heading to Africa in 2004 to do missionary work.--The screams occur between 2:00-4:00 am, every couple of months.  The last scream heard was in the spring of 2003.--The witness also hears grunts and \u0093chirp\u0094 like noises, as does his neighbor at the \u0093Lazy Z.\u0094--The witness and his wife sleep with the window partly open, and most of the sounds appear to come from the back of the house.--Last time the \u0093chirp\u0094 sound was heard was three weeks ago.--There are many old mines in the area where a \u0093bigfoot\u0094 could be safe during the winter.--The area around his property, including 65+ acres of undeveloped land, is very suitable for a large animal to live in.--This area of Sonora/Twain Harte is generally very quiet during the winter, because many of the homes belong to summer only residents.--The witness has noted strange footprints in the past, but didn\u0092t investigate further.--The witness notes that when the strange noises are occurring, the raccoons won\u0092t come up onto the deck to both the trash, and the dogs are very quiet, like they sense something present.--The witness never did find his dog.Comment:  the investigator has heard these \u0093chirp\u0094 noises as well and can not attribute it to a known animal in the Sonora area.",
