            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness and found him to be very credible.  He is a seasoned hunter and outdoorsman and very familiar with the area and its wildlife.He was bow hunting for deer on an arm of Cherokee Lake between Mooresburg and Sneedville, Tennessee, and had walked in to his hunting spot around 5 am with a portable tree stand.  Around 8 am he shot at and missed a deer.  After spending another hour in his stand and realizing that the woods were extremely quiet and the deer were probably not coming back he decided to call it a day.The TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) lowers the levels of all of the major lakes and reservoirs during the fall and winter and this had already happened for that year, so the witness decided to walk out in the now dry lake/river bed to avoid having to walk through the heavy growth on the rock shelf above the normal water line.  As he was walking out he heard an animal grunting and growling from the tree line on top of the shelf.  This was approximately 8' above him.  Upon stopping the witness realized that the trees were moving and in fact being shaken.  The trees along the shelf were 15 - 16 ft. tall and 2 - 3\" in diameter, a combination of pine, oak and maple.  There was also a heavy undergrowth of scrub brush which made visibility extremely limited, but the witness estimated that the animal was 30 - 40 feet away from him.As he continued to hurry from the area the animal kept pace with him and continued to make grunting and growling noises.The witness also noted that this area was a dropping ground for unwanted dogs and that the now wild dogs were packing together and had become quite a nuisance and somewhat dangerous, following people and acting aggressively.  He found it interesting that no dogs were seen at all that day.  He also is very familiar with bear and their habits and has never seen any sign of bear in that area. ",

            "Observed": "A friend and I had decided to go fishing one morning after working the night shift. We arrived at eagle creek around six thirty it was still very dark out but had our lanterns with us. As we stopped the car and got out we walked to the back of the car to get our equipment as soon as my buddy popped the trunk lock we heard a horrible scream and what sounded like someone yelling but the speech was backwards this sent chills down our backs. The sound came from the area we were headed. We waited a few seconds and tried to think of an explanation of the sound but couldn't come up with any thing. We fished  till morning light and then decided to walk the creek edge. We came across a sand bar with a lot of  mussels attached to some shale rocks that protruded up from under the sand as we got closer we saw signs that something had been digging at the mussels at first I thought this could have been any animal doing this but as we got even closer we saw two very detailed foot prints in the sand. There is no doubt in ether of our minds that someone had walked in the sand with bare feet. The prints were approximately 12 to 13 inches what puzzled us was what was someone doing out at six thirty in the morning in early spring with an outside  temp around 35 degrees because we had very heavy clothes on because of the cold and the prints led straight up a four foot embankment and into some very heavy thorn brush the kind that a you can't even walk threw  with out ripping your cloths to shreds. We walked the rest of the creek but couldn't find any other signs or prints.",
