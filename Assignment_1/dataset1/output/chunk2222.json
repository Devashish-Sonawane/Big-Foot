Let me explain my situation to you: I live, and have lived, on the Molalla river for most of my life and never thought twice about walking around at night or anywhere period. About 2 months ago, I was alone in my Grandmas house using the computer, when I decided to go home (my house is only about 50 yards away). As I was stepping outside the most hideous feeling of being alone and fear thumped my heart. I kept walking in terror, when all of the sudden about 30 feet off to my right, I heard a loud thumping sound crash out. From there on, being distorted by my act of running faster than I've ever moved before, I could swear I heard the distinctive two-legged footsteps veering toward me from off the trail between houses. I raced in my house, slammed the door, locked it and sat in the living room to calm down from my strange experience.The oddest feelings flushed through me then, and now. Now, before you dismiss my story as a frightened child running from noises, I'll have to tell you of the strange past our 45 acres of land at the end of the Dickey Prairie road has had:",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is confident that what he experienced was a sasquatch following, if not chasing, him back to his house. He told me that the thumping, which he at first thought was someone stealing firewood, sounded like bipedal steps. He likened it to \"being chased by a thousand pound man\" when he started running. At the time this happened, there was a musky smell in the area.He also told me of other incidents. One, about a year before this, when something frightened his younger brother while the two of them were hunting on their property. His brother maintains that what he saw was a young sasquatch, Shawn told me he didn't get a clear view. Another involved something getting into their garbage. The refuse was placed in a trailer and covered with a tarp, which was then weighted down with blocks of wood. In order to get into it, something had strewn the wood 15-25 ft. from the trailer and rolled back the tarp. Ripped open bags were found in a field on the property. A third thing he talked about were vocalizations he and his stepfather heard at night. He described them as booming, echoing whoops.The witness and his family have since moved from this location.",
