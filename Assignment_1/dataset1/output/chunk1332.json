            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the father of the witness by phone. Some details of that interview were incorporated into the report. The BFRO does not normally post reports for the public where the witness was not directly interviewed. In this case, because of the age of the child, I felt it was best for the father to conduct the interview with his son before talking with me. Because the child\u0092s sighting occurred so close in time and location to Report 7804, we are hoping this report encourages others who may have seen/heard something in this area to come forward. Please contact either myself or Robert Strain if you would like to report a sighting from this area or if you have other pertinent information. You can use either the \u0093Submit a report\u0094 or the \u0093Submit a comment\u0094 links shown at the bottom of this page, or you can contact me using the provided email address.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "     I interviewed the witness on September 7, 2003.  He has become very interested in the sasquatch mystery since he experienced this incident in Wyoming.  The following reported facts can be added to the written report:     The witness was on vacation with his grandmother, grandfather, aunt, and uncle.  They were planning to drive into Yellowstone Park, but because of inclement weather camped in a campground in Teton National Park.  There were only perhaps two or three RV's in the campground on this particular night in early June. The campers had gotten snowed off of Jackson Lake that day, so there was snow on the ground making it easy to observe the large, dark figure from the windows of their RV.      He estimated the creature to be about 7' tall with 4' wide shoulders and a conical, hairy head. It was reaching up into a tree as they could see the bough moving.  They could hear it grunting before it turned toward the RV and then ran off in long strides.  \"Huge\" tracks were seen in the snow the following morning.",
