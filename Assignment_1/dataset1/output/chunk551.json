            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness had just entered the state of Alabama from the Mississippi side of the state line. Driving in a rural area with his bright lights on and seeing an approaching car the witness dimmed his lights. When he flicked the high beams back on, in the headlights a blonde 7ft tall creature was beginning to cross a clearing at the edge of the woods. The driver was sitting up high in a semi, the high beams spread wider than the low beams. At that point it just keeps moving without looking up which brings it right to the road and across. The bigfoot was thin with long blonde hair about 5 inches long covering its body. The animal moved across the road about 200 ft. from his truck, headed east with a bent knee stride, it covered the width of the road in two strides. It appear to be crossing from one wooded area to another.The witness spoke to a long lost friend a while later and when telling the tale, the friend\u0092s first response was \u0093Was it blonde\u0094. It seems that people have been seeing something similar in the area for at least 26 years.",
