The reason I am reporting it now is because I was watching the History Channel, and the animal they displayed was very similar, with a few exceptions.  The hair was even over the body, the History Channel display was baggy at the ankles and narrow at the knees.  The eyes were definitely very red.  The time of the incident was approximately 1AM in the morning.  The importance is the animal was no more than 150 feet from me, and I stopped the car and the animal and I stared at each other for quite a long time, until I got tired and left the scene.",

He felt the color was dark brown/black and the hair was not overly long.  The female witness, however, remembered the hair color as reddish, and she felt that the hair length was \"longish.\"  Neither could come up with exactly how long they sat and stared at the creature. The man also stated that it was very peculiar how the eyes were a very visible red, even when the car headlights were not shining into them when the creature was standing in the field.",
