He caught the profile of the animal first and noted that its head was shaped like a man's only larger, and that there was no snout visible.  He saw no distinct ears.  Its legs were long and its height was estimated at eight feet.  The overall color of the animal was brown with a lighter brownish tone across the shoulders and down the back.The sighting lasted over thirty minutes.  The animal did not respond to whistles made by the witness.  During the sighting the witness felt spooked, amazed, and was understandably shaken afterwards.",
