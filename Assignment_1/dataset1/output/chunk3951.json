About 1/4 mi. east of the Bates-Amasa Road and slightly west of the road side park, a Bigfoot crossed the highway in front of her.  It was going from south to north. The area to the immediate north of the Hwy has very old mature Elm and Maple/hardwoods with little underbrush then fades to older farm lands.  The area it came from has hardwoods immediately by the highway going back to brushy clearings with raspberry brush and then my aunt's backyard.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the sister on the phone and thru emails. She provided her brother's phone number and I was able to discuss his sighting with him on the phone.  When he was between 12 - 14 years of age, his Mother and the neighbors hunted deer, and the children would drive the deer, slowly and quietly walking thru the woods in a straight line.  He described that each 40 acre lot were brushed along the fenceline to make an 8 - 10 ft. wide road so they could drive tractors around each fence line. He was farther ahead of the rest on one of these roads and stopped at their meeting spot, a corner of the fence. He waited for the others and looked for deer. He said he was looking down one of the fence lines and he saw the \"creature\" step over the fence, a 1/4 mile or 1300 ft. away. He remained there until the rest of the hunting party came out of the woods from the direction that this creature came from. He did not see any deer. He knew that what he had seen was not a man. The fence it stepped over was at four ft. and he estimated the creature to be at least 8 ft. The color was a dark brown/black, darker than the deer. Due to the distance and the length of time that has passed, he doesn't remember additional detail. He does not recall looking for tracks, stating that he doesn't remember much of what occurred right after his sighting. The memory has stuck in his mind all this time. His sister is three years older and she also remembers that day well. The terrain is a bit different on the farm since it has not been kept up. North of the sighting is a low, swampy area. There was a lot of wildlife seen on the farm while growing up, he remembers fox, deer and bear. He had several encounters with bear and was always afraid of the bear. \"I've had encounters with bear, but nothing like that\".  The witness assured me that he knew what bear looked like and this was no bear. Their immediate family was together because of a funeral and they were sitting outside in the evening. They mentioned the brother seeing a Bigfoot at the neighbor's up the road while doing a deer drive in the back 40 of the neighbor's farm.  The niece then told them she had seen one cross the road on her way home from work one night. Until that time she did not know about their hunting story and seemed relieved to be able to talk about it with someone who could share or confirm the reality of what she had seen. I have tried contacting the niece and hope to discuss her sighting with her one day soon. ",
