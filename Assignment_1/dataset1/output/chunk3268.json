            "Observed": "I have saw what I would call a big foot three times. The first time it was in the fall of 2010. It was late at night. I woke up by my dogs barking. I got up to see what was going on. Thru the screen door I could see a large dark figure walking across my pasture going to my barn. I went back to my bed room and got a gun. I stepped out the door. The creature was a few feet from my barn and I noticed its head was level with the bottom of the roof of my barn. It was very large.  I fired one shot in the air to try to scare it off. It didn't phase it. I then opened fire. It took off running across the pasture running thru 3 strands of wire. One of my dogs took off after it and I followed. I shot 14 40 cal. bullets toward this creature and it didn't slow it down. It disappeared into the corn behind my house. I had goats in the barn. Twice in the fall of 2011 I saw it walking across the field once in the field behind my house once in front. Both time going south to north.",

            "Observed": "It was about 8:pm , it had been an Indian summer type day and I had taken my horse for a long ride one saturday afternoon , I lost track of time and I was late getting back from my ride, this horse was a wellbroke animal and as I came down a dirt road where there was a plank bridge the horse started to prance, snort and blow and he was watching something off to my left, I have excellent night vision and started trying to see what was spooking the horse. This horse had a long mane and I noticed it standing part way out like it was charged by static electricity, and the hair on my arms and back of my neck were standing up too. There was a full moon coming up that night and about a 10 mile an hour wind from the north blowing against my back. as I got over the bridge on the horse I could see in an opening in a meadow two large creatures standing erect and side by side watching me on the horse.They appeared too be swaying back and forth like they were trying to scent what was coming down the road. One looked to be about 7-8 ft tall and the other 6-7ft tall.I started to get scared even though they were on the other side of a barbed wire fence and about 35yards from the horse and me. I kicked the horse into a gallop and headed home my heart pounding in my chest. I looked back over my shoulder and saw them disappear slowly still walking erect into the woods.",
