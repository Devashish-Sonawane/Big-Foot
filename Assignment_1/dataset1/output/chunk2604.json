            "Observed": "I was on my way to Claremont from Lebanon on Rte 120 and was passing by some reeds in a marshy area next to the road that sounded like a huge flock of birds. The creature came out of the reeds and was crouched down looking at me through them. Surprisingly it got out of the reeds from crouched to standing turned around and ran towards the wooded area up a hill and was moving with it's arms brush and tree branches out of the way. It was incredibly fast runner and I got a good look at its coconut shaped head as it ran away. It was light brown/brown. It had incredibly broad shoulders. I went back the same day. The marsh went up to my knees and I could smell a bad odor like garbage. Myself and a friend went back to the sighting. We found a footprint and a hair sample. I could hear wood knocks when my friend James did a call and we also found a large bed of branches and some tree structures. The following month I went back to Claremont and I heard screeching in the woods while I was traveling Rte. 120 on a bicycle.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Myself and another investigator, Jeff Sheppard, performed a site visit with the witness, Shane T., and his friend James D.  They took us to the exact location of the encounter.  Shane. pointed out the location in the swampy area of Stevens Brook along Rte. 120 in Claremont, NH.  He indicated that as he was walking along the road on Tuesday, June 7th at about 5 am - he heard a \"strange\" noise - almost like birds rustling in the reeds.  As he stopped to listen - a large creature stood up and started to run away from him.  He did mention that he did see its face partially as it ran away.  We tried to determine the approximate height of the creature - but, it was marshy.  It was estimated that the creature was over 7 ft. tall.  He witnessed it for approximately 45 - 60 seconds.  He indicated that it had a \"coconut shaped\" head and was light brown in color with very broad shoulders.  He also indicated that it had a smell like \"garbage\" and was extremely fast.    It made no other noises other than the pushing of the bushes and reeds out of the way as it ran away.  After the encounter he continued on his way, as he had an appointment that he was going to.  Later that day a friend of his, James D. met him and they both went back to the location.  They indicated that they made a few calls and received wood knocks back in response.  They went back to the location on June 11th to seek other signs of evidence.  They had a hair sample that they had collected off a barb-wired fence.  I have photos of where the hair was collected and noticed lots of bear scat and sign.  I had contacted our hair expert regarding the sample and we both concluded that the hair that was collected was bear.  There was also deer hair on the same barb-wired fence.  It was right next to the swamp and a bunch of apple trees. About a month later he heard \"screeching\" about 1/4 mile up the road in a field.  I have the audio file he created with his cell phone.  I do not believe the recording to be a sasquatch.  It sounded more like a baby deer calling for its mother. The witness travels this road frequently, and will let us know if he sees anything else.",

            "Observed": "This week, my roommate's parents, who live about 10 miles north of Russleville, went out of town for vacation. They left my roommate to house-sit, so we took the opportunity to play some video games on their giant 3d tv. While taking a smoke break outside, we all began to hear a moaning in the distance that was driving all of the local dogs crazy. Initially the calls were quite frequent, in groups of three or so, with maybe a minute or two of silence between each group of three. As the dogs would calm down, the howl became audible again. We couldn't identify exactly what we were hearing, like a siren with a growl in the lower register; but we were too far out of town for this to be any kind of emergency vehicle, or boat horn. We couldn't even decide that this was an animal any of us had heard before. As the night progressed, the howls became less frequent and farther away, though they maintained the repetitive grouping. My friends know me to be the bigfoot enthusiast of our group, but I wasn't about to try to confirm what we were hearing as a sasquatch call without some point of reference. When I listened to the 1994 Moaning Howl recording  from Ohio, I asked my roommates if it sounded familiar, all agreed; so, I'm posting this today.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone on 3/27/2012. He seemed very sincere and his description of the event was consistent with the submitted report. The witness arrived at the house around 12:30am after work and he along with 3 other friends continued to hear a siren-type call every time they'd go out for a smoke break until about 3am. They noticed that, \"all the dogs and horses were freaking out.\" The witness described the call as sounding like, \"a siren from the 1930s and 40s, that would growl at the bottom [of the register] and then crescendo up.\" The witness mimicked the call for me and the growl started at the beginning of the call. The witness estimates the length of the calls anywhere between 3-7 seconds, and occurred mostly in groups of 3 or 4 then \"silence from anywhere between 2 to 10 minutes and then start back up again\". He states that he heard no other calls in response to the one they hearing, and that it came from a North/Northeastern direction. When they heard the call, he said his friends were all wondering what it was, but he had an idea that what they were hearing was a bigfoot but didn't want to say anything because he didn't want them to think he was crazy. It wasn't until one of his friends finally exclaimed, \"Is that a bigfoot?\" that he nodded his head. The next day the witness went on to the BFRO website and listened to the 1994 Ohio - Moaning Howl  and played it for all the guys there and they all agreed that it was the same sound.The witness seems very knowledgeable about bigfoot. He says that from an early age his first memory of knowing about bigfoot was having watched Harry and the Hendersons. Also, when he was a child he remembers hearing a story from his father, a hunter, who told him about some fresh three toed tracks he had found with his friend while they were hunting. Wanting to corroborate the stories, later the witness asked his dad's friend about the incident and his friend told the exact same story as his dad, convincing the witness from a young age. He's read many many reports on the BFRO website and is very interested in the subject.The reported direction of the calls correlates geographically as coming from the Ozark National Forest, a perfect habitat.
