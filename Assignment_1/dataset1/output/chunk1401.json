            "Observed": "It was late July 2007 and my wife and I had brought our newborn baby daughter home just a few days earlier. It was about 1 AM and I was in the living room of my house watching television after pulling 2nd shift at work. My wife and baby daughter were two rooms away sleeping. She had opened the bedroom window earlier to let a little cool air in. All of a sudden a scream came from that corner of the house that stood me right up off the couch. I ran to the bedroom to find my wife sitting up in the bed as wide eyed and shocked as me. When I finally gathered myself enough and went outside to investigate, I found nothing. We kind of forgot about it until watching Finding Bigfoot several years later. They played what they thought were howls of the creature recorded on tape. My wife and I looked at each other and totally agree that whatever made the howls on the program is exactly what we heard that night. It's a sound you never forget.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "While discussing the experience with Mr. R., he had the following to say about the scream he and his wife heard that evening, \"it started out in a lower pitch and rose to an ear shattering scream which stood me right up off my couch. It was not a coyote or bobcat and was different from anything we have ever heard\". Since Mr. R. first submitted the report of the scream he heard, he has experienced other conspicuous events around his home. In July 2012 he submitted an update report, the content of which is replicated here:\"I made a report of an incident back in 2007 where me and my wife heard a scream through an open window. Now for the last few days we have been hearing what I can only figure are tree knocks which are as loud and clear as you would want them to be. On July 16th my wife was laying in the sun when she heard three or four loud knocks in the woods behind our house. I checked to see if anyone was hammering or anything nearby and saw nothing. The next day I was mowing the lawn and heard three loud knocks which sounded like they were right there with me over top of the lawnmower engine. It was so loud it startled me. I stood quiet for a minute or two checking my surroundings and never heard anything else. That has continued on into today, but the ones I heard seemed farther away. I don't know if it has anything to do with it, but our neighbors claimed a small bear ran out of our backyard a couple of weeks ago. I haven't seen any footprints or heard anymore screams, but I just know strange things seem to happen around here in July.\"",
