Myers to visit my grandparents (as we did every December). We stopped in Ocala National Forest \u0097 I don't remember the campground because we didn't get there until after nightfall, and I remember we went to Alexander Springs the next day, which was close by. Anyway, we drove through the campground and picked one of the last spots, several empty camp spaces away from the closest camper. The night was mild (certainly compared to North Georgia), and we all had sleeping bags, so we just pitched them on the sandy ground under the stars.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This investigator spoke with the witness for about one hour. The following information was gleaned from this interview regarding the original report:-The witness was not in a tent, but sleeping on the ground, in a sleeping bag.-His head was pointed toward a field of saw grass. -The foot falls being bipedal indicated to him that it was likely some camper moving about looking for a place to urinate, but when they came close and he heard it breathing, is when he determined that it was NOT human, but deep and full like that of a very large animal.-He stated that the breathing sounds were well above his head, not close to the ground, but after it stopped walking, he heard several long sniffs or inhalations close to his head; not short, quick sniffs like a dog would do, but deeper inhalations, close to his head. It was then that he became terrified.-He stated that he must have moved or startled the intruder somehow, sensing that the intruder knew he was awake, and apparently backed away and out of the area without making a sound. This witness gave every indication of being entirely credible.There have been several reports, both Class A sightings and Class B encounters in this general area, including several from BFRO investigators.  Because of the amount of reports we receive from this area, the BFRO has held three public expeditions in the Ocala National Forest and several private expeditions as well. This reported encounter, though taking place some number of years ago, is entirely consistent with other reports in the area of Sasquatch activity.  ",
