            "Observed": "Me and my friend were going back on a service road at Mud Mountain Dam In Washington State near Enumclaw, WA on Mud Mountain Road. We walked down the road and it slopes down and to the right. On the right is a hillside that goes straight up and to the left was a hillside that goes down and at the bottom is a circular area that is dry and wetlands. I looked to my left as I neared the curve in the road and what I believe to be a bigfoot was crouched down getting water from the swampy area. It then snapped its head over really quick looked at us and then stood up. It had to have been around 8 feet tall. It was a brown red color, darker than a mountain lion. I ran as fast as i could back to my car. I looked back and my friend had seen it and he was right behind me. I have been back many times and have never seen anything again but I will never ever forget what I saw. I am reporting this so many years later because my friend recently saw something a few miles up 410 near scatter creek and I know there is something in that area!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length and found her able to recall the encounter with great clarity. The witness was able to provide some additional details to her encounter.  As she came around the bend with her friend they both noticed the animal squatting down and using its hand to drink water from the stream, approximately one-hundred feet away. Once the animal heard them it looked up and turned its head and shoulders toward them in a startled manner. The animal immediately stood up on two legs and froze while keeping constant eye contact with the witness. The witness recalled the animal having reddish brown hair covering it entire body, approximately four to six inches long. The animal stood approximately 7 1/2 ft. tall and had very large dark eyes. The witness and her friend said they looked at the animal for 10 to 15 seconds, not believing what they were seeing.  The witness recalled the arms of the animal hanging down below its knees as it stood there looking back at them. Upon realizing what they were looking at they turned and ran back up the road towards their car. The witness recalled hearing branches breaking as the animal made its way back into the forest.The witness provided the name of the individual that was with her that afternoon. He is still living in the area and I was given possible contact information.  I was not able to contact him.  If he contacts me, I will update this report.I was able to meet with the witness. She was able to take me to the exact location of her sighting. In addition to fresh running water, the area has great numbers of salmon berries, huckleberries, blueberries and blackberries.",
