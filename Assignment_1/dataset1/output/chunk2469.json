On the third morning right at dusk we headed out to hunt some deer, I told my friend to hike up this mountain and follow it until he comes down on the other side, and I would hike up mid way and do the same in hope of spooking up some deer. We were to meet on the back side at the bottom the mountain and top side of a wash.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness by phone.For many years he hunted this area for bear, elk, deer and turkey prior to this sighting and for a few years after.  During one of his hunts he had a very close encounter with a black bear, this witness is very familiar with wildlife and is confident with what he saw.While following the fox he noticed the fox looking back and off to the right.  Looking in that direction he saw a large, dark brown biped covered in hair.  He saw the animal look back in his direction as it walked down into a ravine moving away from his position. He had a full body view at about 120 yards, as it walked into the ravine he lost sight of it. The sighting lasted about 5-8 seconds and took him the first few seconds to realize what he really was seeing. He continued his hunt and met up with his partner as planned who was coming from the other side of the mountain. He did not consider following or returning to look for tracks.Other than his hunting partner he did not see anyone else or other vehicles in the area during the hunt.",
