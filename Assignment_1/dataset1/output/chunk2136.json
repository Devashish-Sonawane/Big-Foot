            "Observed": "I was driving south down from the mountain on my regular route I had my high beams on because its dark in that area. Its very rural when all of sudden a large up right dark figure stepped out into the road I stopped and watch it cross the road in three steps. This thing was so tall that it stood at least a foot and half above the rack on the roof of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. The legs were long and it bent at the knees like a human. All I seen was the side profile of it. It was very tall and from what I could see the head was large and long, the shoulder span was very wide. The side profile of the face was flat. It very quickly in three steps crossed the road.(its a wide two lane road). After it crossed I drove forward a little and tried to see where it went but couldn't see it any more. This thing was frightening. I have been looking for it everytime I'm on my route but had not seen it again. On my other route which is on county road 306 about a 10min drive from this incident two days later there was a very strange strong smell in the area around 3am again. The smell was a very strong sweet burning rubber smell, I can't describe it, I never smelled anything like it before. I smelled this for two days straight in this area and then it was gone.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to this witness on the phone on May 1st, 2012. The witness was delivering newspapers at approximately 5am driving south on Trail West Drive in Buena Vista, CO when she witnessed a large black bipedal figure moving across the road in her headlights. She recalls the figure moving gracefully as it crossed the road in three large steps. She noticed that it had massive shoulders as well as legs and arms which seemed longer than a person\u0092s (in her words \u0093definitely lower than the figure\u0092s waist\u0094). The height of the figure was estimated to be at least 1.5 to 2 feet taller than her vehicle (based on her vehicle height this would put the figure at about 7\u0092 1\u0092\u0092 to 7\u0092 7\u0092\u0092). She noticed it having hair on its legs and shoulders. Of particular note was her mention of bent knees and swinging arms. She also thought it was odd that it was eerily quiet as she had not heard the normal sounds of the early morning wildlife, not even sounds of insects. ",

            "Observed": "It was about 20 yrs ago. in Roscommon Mich. on M-18 just south of the town Roscommon at the sub power station. It happened at about 9pm at night in the fall. I had a friend with me that night and he saw it also. At the time we thought it was the dogman of Roscommon County. But of the the years I have been thinking about it and seeing your show and the people seeing them in Michigan I am now really believing it was a bigfoot. If this interests you let me know. Thanks",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.  He now lives in Colorado.    He stated that he and a friend were driving south on M-18 heading towards Houghton Lake, driving from Roscommon.  Near the Consumers Energy substation they seen a tall, hair covered figure cross the road from the right (west) to left (east).  The following details were noted by the witness:- The figure was between a quarter and half mile away.- It was still light out but getting dusk.- The figure was very tall.  At least 7 ft, possibly 8 ft tall.- The witness noticed it was covered in hair and a dark brown, uniform color.  - It walked upright the entire time, but slightly hunched over.- The arms swung as it walked.The witness stated he and his friend slowed way down as they approached the spot where the figure crossed but were too unnerved to get out and investigate.  The area of the sighting is heavily wooded with a mixture of rolling hills that are covered with hardwoods and pines.  It is part of the AuSable State Forest.  There is a large area of swampy, lowland just to the southeast known as the Robinson Creek flooding. The Cut River runs a couple miles to the west, running from Higgins Lake to Houghton Lake.  The area has plenty wildlife including deer, black bear, coyote, beaver, muskrat, bobcat and numerous small game.  Food and water sources would be plentiful for a large predator.     ",
