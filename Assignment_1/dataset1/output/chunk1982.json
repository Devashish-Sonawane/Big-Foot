            "Observed": "Was out for a run a couple of weeks ago and during my cool down I noticed what might be footprints in some dried mud. I have pictures and will send them if needed, most of the area is flat with some surrounding hills and low trees (juniper, oak, ect.). I'm unsure whether or not these are actual tracks due to the many other obvious boot and shoe prints in the same area; but, a few of the tracks have what looks like toe impressions and all are fairly large. All were bigger than my size 13 shoe, there is also a sighting reported in the same area on this website, October 2006 Navajo County, AZ near Cibecue. I live right behind the school and about 1/2 mile away from the old airport and have heard numerous stories, including one about two months before of three people seeing one sasquatch cross the road, and people seeing a sasquatch near the school dumpsters.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I communicated with the witness several times both by phone and email and the following details can be added: He is a teacher who has lived in the remote town of Cibecue, AZ his whole life.The road the prints were found beside is very close to the Cibecue Creek riparian area and it seems reasonable that any animal that intended to travel from one side of the valley to the other, using the creek to hide its presence, would have to travel on or very near, this road at some point in its trek. When asked why he thought the prints were not human, the witness replied that, \"there were a lot of obvious boot and shoe prints. The thing that caught me with these prints was...they were about 6 or 7 feet apart and more sunk and not 'skidded' in the mud...kind of struck me as unusual. I'm 5'10\" and lucky to clear 3' in my strides so in my opinion I guess there was something \"non-human\" about them. The witness also said that the prints were in more or less a straight line, narrow pattern.The prior BFRO report the witness referred to is                  Report#19339. Here are the photos the witness took: ",
