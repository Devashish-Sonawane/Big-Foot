            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness via telephone to discuss his experiences.The witness was struck by the immense size and swift movements of the creature. His profession and training lend credibility to his estimates of the height and weight of the animal he observed. The area in which the creature was seen has yielded multiple sightings, auditory observations and track finds.  Members of the Georgia Chapter of the BFRO have had encounters in the area as well. This particular section of the Chattahoochee National Forest is one of the richest areas in Northeast Georgia, with regard to flora and fauna. The area has large populations of deer, wild pigs, turkeys and black bears. In addition, trout are abundant in the river and streams. The headwaters of the Chattahoochee River begin here. The deep river gorges, bermed logging roads, and the nearby Appalachian Trail create useful travel ways for large, evasive, nocturnal mammals. Although people frequent the area for its fishing, hunting, hiking and camping, the vast majority of the area is not traveled, and is accessible only off-trail, on foot.     ",
