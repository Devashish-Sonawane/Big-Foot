While fishing, two large splashes occurred down the riverbank.  He then heard a quick, short scream. He insisted was not an owl, nor any common animal.  Afterwards, he heard a rustling of leaves, like somebody reaching down into a pile of leaves to create noise.  Finally, he heard a very deep, 'purring' breathing sound, then the creature moved away.  The following year, a twisted tree snap (3-4 inch trunk) was found, about 5 feet off the ground, and an 'extreme' smell, like a wet dog mixed with skunk, was also noticed.   Although nothing definitive was observed during this incident, the combination of elements justifies its inclusion in the database as a possible Class B incident.",

However my mind was still not focused other than I was waiting for movement of sorts. It\u0092s second nature to keep a eye out for deer in this area. When I finally noticed that I was looking at  something unusual.  I saw a tall hairy animal walking off into the woods (on two feet) from the road. It had long blonde to light brown hair all over. I never saw the face. I kept my eyes focused on the woods where it walked into. When I reached that spot I was completely shocked at the size that creature was. It had to be at least 9 - 10 feet tall. The only thing I could think of was Bigfoot.",
