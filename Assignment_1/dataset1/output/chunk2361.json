            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with Ron H. tonight, and he informed me that he had turned in two reports, one on a putrid smell and the other on a hair-raising screaming sound.  Ron is an outdoors person and is aware of things that are out of place, like the strange smell situation he encountered in Mississippi and the strange sounds that he and his son heard in their Arizona hunting camp.Ron said that the screeching sound was something that he had never heard before, it made the hair on the back of his neck stand up, and was defiantly heard over the party that was going on in the next camp. Ron best described the, screaming sound as between a lady screaming and a mountain lion scream.  But, also there was this lower pitch noise that was incorporated within the wavering scream.  Ron also stated that the screams were much louder than the noise that was going on in the next camp, and the sounds were coming about one hundred yards away on the other side of their camp trailer.  The following day, after the screams of the previous night, they inspected the area for anything unusual while hunting, but they didn\u2019t see anything out of place.Ron\u2019s son, who is now twenty-two years old, has subsequently heard on the Discovery Channel a bigfoot sound that was similar to the one that he and his father heard on their hunting trip. Ron and his son have been back hunting and camping in the same area, but have not noticed anything unusual.See state of Mississippi report #2376, Jackson County, for Ron\u2019s other experience. ",

My older brother and I were messing around in the creek below the ghost town and we looked up to see bigfoot running up the creek. We were a little scared at seeing what looked to be a very hairy human running up past us. It just not really looked like a human face - it was different. He kind of looked like a monkey with a human body. My brother and I ran up to where our family was having a BBQ and they ran down just to see him running into the trees. Since that day I have been very interested in this mysterious creature that has left an image in my head.",
