            "Follow-Up Report": "The following is the text from an email inquiry:Witness: >Your questions with my answers below follow. First though, please amend the date in my report toJuly 12.  Since writing, I found a blog entry I madeat that date. 1. Did it seem as if the howler was moving, orstationary?  How long were the individual howls? Didthey change in pitch, and if so,  how?Ans - It was a few blocks off, but it soundedstationary.  The howls, as best I recall, lastedlonger than the dogs - perhaps around 45 seconds orso, as opposed to 15-20 secs for the dogs.  Didn'tchange in pitch so much as it grew louder.  Maybe 2 or3 good howls. 2. The inevitable question: Are you familiar withsounds  from known animals such as coyotes, mountainlions, elk, etc.? Ans - I've encountered mountain lions and bears, butit didn't sound like them.  Coyotes - only from adistance.  Mostly on tape or film.  Never heard an elkso couldn't say.3. Have you listened  to any of the sound files on theBFRO website? Ans - Unfortunately, my sound card is not working. So, no I haven't.4. Does what you heard sound like  any of the sound files, either of known animals or of supposedbigfoot  calls?Ans - Again, not on your website.  I can only say it was at a distance.  It could havebeen a dog, but it was strange and reminded me more ofa large gibbon.  Whatever it was, it surely upsetthose dogs that were barking at it.<Comments: Although the witness was unable to do their own research to try to identify the vocalizations that they heard and eliminate known animals that they have not heard before, they were unusual enough and the circumstances extraordinary enough to warrant the filing of a report with the BFRO.",
