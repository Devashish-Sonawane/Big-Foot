I was approaching the longest bridge between ROCKY FORD ROAD & Rt 53, I saw something that looked like very tall man standing near the side of the bridge. I had my bright lights on, so I flashed my lights to warn this pedestrian at this hour that I was approaching. I then tapped the horn, but this very large figure didn't run. It appeared as I drew closer to be reaching for something beyond the bridge, (perhaps leaves of the trees) I began to slow down as I approached the bridge, fearing this very big man was drunk, and would stagger in",

She commented several times on the great size of the animal, saying, \"I've seen a lot of real big men, but this was something else.\" She was quite struck by the \"red glow\" reflecting from the animal's eye as it turned its head in toward her approaching car. That in particular really frightened her. The experience was so unnerving to the witness that she didn't look carefully at the animal but hit the gas and sped by when she saw the red eye shine.The witness was not generally knowledgable about bears but her initial sense that she was seeing a very big man, the fact that it stood on its hind legs, and that it was reaching out seemingly to grasp something, all suggest it was not a bear.

            "Observed": "I was in Mammoth Lakes, Ca. on a weekend trip playing softball. It was a Sunday night. My roommate, my brother and myself were the only ones to stay that night. It was around 1:30 in the morning, when my dog woke me up. She was whining and pacing in the tent. I was trying to calm her down when I heard this sound. I am a serious bigfoot believer and visit the BFRO site often. The sound I heard, which I recognized immediately, was exactly like the HOWL recordings on the BFRO website. When I heard this howl, I instantly sat up. I listened for about 20 or 30 seconds when my brother suddenly sat up and said \"what the hell is that?\". I said I wasn't sure because I didn't want to sound crazy by saying it was bigfoot. The howl went on for another minute or so. When it was over, my brother said \"I have never heard a noise like that. What was that?\" That's when I told him I think we just heard bigfoot. I have since played the recording of the HOWL back to my brother, and he agrees that is what we heard. My roommate never woke up so he never heard it. The entire time the howl was going on, my dog was really freaking out. I know in my heart, I heard bigfoot that night.",
