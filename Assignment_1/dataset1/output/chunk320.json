            "Follow-Up Report": "A video of the caretaker's interview is here:This report was first brought to our attention after BFRO Investigator Vince Lauria gave a lecture at a country club in Alabama. A Birmingham attorney volunteered the information that a caretaker on his land had seen a bigfoot several years ago. The attorney claimed that he had never really believed bigfoot existed until his caretaker had stated that he had seen one. The attorney commented that the man has worked for him for several decades and that he was incredibly honest. \u0093He never lied to me before, so I can\u0092t imagine him lying about something like that.\u0094 With the exchange of names and information we were able to contact the witness and hear his story.In August of 2004 the witness was driving north on private land along the Sepulga River. It was dusk, he had been plowing fields. As he turned a bend he saw a 6-7 ft black, hairy creature cross the road from right to left.  The witness said it was less than 20 feet in front of him running quickly. It looked at him, kept eye contact but never slowed down or stopped. The witness had his window down and could hear it running through the thick woods after he lost sight of it. The witness described that it had a manlike face, with very long arms. The hair was black and shaggy, and he could see the hair hanging from its hands. It was not thin, but muscular. Dark skin was visible on the face, it had a wide nose, and a conical head. When it ran, it pumped its arms. It came from the direction of the river, and appeared to be wet.The witness said he had found footprints by the river earlier in the summer and didn\u0092t know what had made them. Once he saw the bigfoot, he then realized that it had been responsible for the prints. He has not seen or heard of one before or since that summer. He told his boss and family only. The witness, his family, Investigator Vince Lauria and I went to the location of the road crossing. It is heavily wooded, bordered by the river and farm land. It is very secluded. There is a power line road that borders the property as well.Vince recalls interviewing a Native American brother and sister that saw a bigfoot on the other side of the river less than a mile away. Both of them reported having a black bigfoot run across the road in July of the same year. In both reports, the creature was running away from the river.",
