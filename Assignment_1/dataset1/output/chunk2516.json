            "Follow-Up Report": "Talked to the witness's father about his daughter's sighting. We discussed other things happening in the area which puzzled him. He has cut several trees from a riding trail which nobody else uses. The trees are pushed over in such a location that its impossible for a horse to walk around them. I asked about deadfall which would accompany windstorms around the downed trees. He reported that there was very few smaller limbs near the road blocks. He has heard unusual cries and screams, not at all like bobcats or mountain lions with which he is familiar.  The child entered a computer room while her father was looking at the BFRO website. She noticed the opening screen and remarked, \"Thats the monkey I saw!\"",
