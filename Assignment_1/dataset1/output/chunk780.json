            "Follow-Up Report": "I received the following e-mail after I sent out my e-mail to R.M. on the evening of August 31, 2007, and just before I talked with him by phone. Hi Richard,I never heard of your site before, and I was looking for maps and goggling Bigfoot highway thinking there was a ranger station at Willow Creek or somewhere to report this to after it happened. I also don't have very good maps and I am not sure where the Oregon Caves are located or even where Happy Camp is located for that matter. I do know I can get there again and in fact, am traveling down that road again this Labor Day Monday. This time I will be going from Yreka to Willow Springs, and I will get a map of the area somewhere down there. From Willow Creek I crossed the Klamath River Bridge and soon saw a campground with trailers and campers and stuff. Went up a hill with some switchbacks and at the top of the hill there was a grassy bank on the north side and the embankment down to the river on the south side. It was just at the crest of this hill that I saw it and it wasn't too far from that bridge. (\u0093Please note this witness drove for 4 hours from Willow Creek before he crossed the above bridge.\u0094) Probably sometime towards the end of next week I will send you more details of the location.Here is a photo of the grassy bank it came down. My daughter just changed her cell phone number so I will have to get that for you too. This picture was using a Sony 717 with an external Sunpak 383 flash. I wish it would have been mounted and ready when I saw this thing I can light up a parking lot with this flash. I know I was scared enough I wasn't getting out of the car cause I was thinking what if it didn't run down the bank, and what if its just off the road watching me? And my daughter was freaked. I saw it long enough to say that's not a bear, that's one of those things!! And my daughter shrieked \"Oh @#&$\" and it was gone in seven maybe eight seconds tops. I would estimate it at about six feet high with really long arms. It wasn't running, but it was taking long quick strides, three steps from the bottom of the bank to the centerline of the pavement and that one turn towards me and the jump. It hurdled the south embankment from the center of the road on its right leg with the left leg straight out like a hurdlers position. It was built extremely stocky with a thick chest and shoulders and it had extremely thick legs. Not as tall as I always heard. But I actually thought that it was a lot of hooey anyway. I don't think so anymore. The only other detail I remember is it was hunched forward swinging its arms almost straight out and straight back sort of ape like with fingers cupped almost like leading its gait with knuckles. And the hair straight from the eye sockets down its front about four to six inches long but shorter on its back and the back of its legs. It wasn't fur it was hair. It was dark brown with almost reddish or rust colored streaks or a tint to it. And its eyes did not glow like a deer or something would. A man would be jogging at a good clip to keep up with this thing walking. I'm not sure whether I would like to see one of these again. It scared me. I would but I wouldn't you know? Listen I don't really talk about this to a whole lot of people cause I Don\u0092t know, it\u0092s strange and most people are skeptical I guess. I wish you luck seeing one of these. I have a question though. Since I know these things are real; you would think by now somebody would have found a dead one or something wouldn't you, or a skeleton or something maybe by deer hunters or somebody? (\u0093I advised him that some of us think that they bury their own.\u0094)I would like to read about this if you know any good web links or something. I will send you better details of the location though.I called R.M. tonight, August 31, 2007, and we went over his encounter on Hwy. 96, somewhere I believe to be between Happy Camp and Yreka, in the early morning hours of August 5, 2005. The reporting party is a very believable and credible person, and he is going to attempt to make a positive location of he and his daughter's encounter this Labor Day weekend. He was traveling east bound on hwy. 96 and the creature crossed this two-lane highway going from North to South, when it made this gigantic leap from the center of this hwy. to several feet off of the other side of that road towards the Klamath River. The witness stated, \u0093That no man could have pulled that one off.\u0094This Sasquatch encounter put his heart in his throat, and it is still very vivid in his mind and he was excited to get to tell his story. R.M. is a family man over 50 years of age, and he had two cameras with him in the back seat of his 1996 Ford Explorer, but this encounter only lasted approximately 8 seconds. He was a nonbeliever prior to this encounter, but he is now a 100%er with very few people to tell his story to. He took a picture of where this creature came down the embankment but it was too dark and to dry to see any footprints. I enlarged this photo and I thought I could see some slide marks in the dry grass, but maybe it was only wishful thinking on my part. Per R.M. this photo does not show any footprints or sliding in the dry grass. This photo was taken at night with a flash and really does not show anything except a dry grass embankment and about half of a paved road which is Hwy. 96 out to the double yellow lines. R.M. said of the creature, \u0093That its arms were overly long for its height, like down to its knees, and to him it had at least a 7foot arm swing span looking like that was way too long for its size.\u0094On September 9, 2007, I talked with R.M. after he made a recent daylight trip backwards down Hwy. 96, from Yreka to Willow Creek, but he couldn\u0092t locate the spot where he and his daughters sighting took place. I attempted to talk with M.M., R.M\u0092s daughter, but she thought better of it, but she did advise her dad where the incident took place. She kind of pinpointed the Hwy. 96 sighting/crossing somewhere around the Seiad Valley area, which is East of Happy Camp, Ca. R.M. couldn\u0092t get over all of the people using that Klamath River, doing their recreational things while he made his Labor Day weekend trek down Hwy. 96; he really wanted to warn them about what was lurking out there in that river area of California.I found the following information in a pamphlet about California\u0092s back road adventures Dated 2006: Has a small map with a statement, \u0093Bigfoot Scenic Byway\u0094 with an arrow pointing to Hwy. 96, saying, \u0093Keep your eyes peeled for Sasquatch as you drive north from Willow Creek. Get the skinny on the beast at the Willow Creek-China Flat Museum,\u0094 Info at 530-629-2693. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I first spoke with the mother of the witness on Oct. 24. The witness, her daughter, was initially unwilling to discuss the incident. According to the mother, the husband of her daughter has no doubt that his wife saw what she described. I spoke with the  mother first and reassured her of the BFRO's intentions and she agreed to speak with her daughter. Shortly thereafter the daughter contacted me about it. Additional details:She was driving home to the Bay Area from her mother's place in Oregon. She was several minutes south of Orick, CA on Highway 101. It was 10:30am on a Sunday, the weather was bright, clear, and sunny. She was accompanied by her 3 year-old son who was asleep in the backseat. She had rounded a corner and was driving parallel to a lagoon that flanked the Pacific Ocean. As she turned the corner and was roughly 100 yards away she saw what she thought was two fishermen in the lagoon: one standing in a side profile to her (facing 101) and the other sitting in the water with a knee up breaking the surface of the water. About 60 yds from the subjects she realized that the one standing was covered in long deep brown/auburn-colored wet fur and was by her estimation 7-8 ft tall, very heavy and muscular. She slowed her car to 10-20 mph and watched intently as the one seated with its back to her seemed to be searching the water for something with its hands while the one standing was slowly walking towards the shoreline. From here on her focus was on the standing animal. She said as it walked it swung its long arms with a strangely exaggerated movement, almost as if it was propelling itself forward with the motion of its arms.  She says the shoulders were extremely large, rounded and muscular. The hair was \u0093wet and seemed to be groomed; not matted or disheveled\". Its head sat on the shoulders and was \u0093oval in shape, kind of rounded at the top, but not conical\u0085more oval shaped\u0094. At this point she was only about 40 ft away from the animals (still in her car) and said she could see the face in profile. The face itself was a \u0093dark cream color, not brown or black\u0094. The face was hairless but framed by light brown, very fine hair. The nose was flat and slightly rounded. From the profile she could see that the eyes were black with almost no (or no) whites at all. The animal never looked directly at her. The animals never seemed concerned by her vehicle. As she passed them she got scared and sped her car up to leave the scene. After arriving home she drew a sketch of the animals she saw. It will be added to this report.I found the witness to be very believeable. The area she is talking about, in Redwoods National Park, has a history of reports. Most of the reports are pre-Internet, second-hand reports, or reports that are otherwise not published.",
