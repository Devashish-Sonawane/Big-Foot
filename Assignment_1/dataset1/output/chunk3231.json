The Trail is a 9-mile loop starting at Spurgeon Hollow Lake looping north towards Delany Creek State Park then continuing east and south connecting to the Knobstone Trail. (The Knobstone Trail is rugged state-maintained trail that winds approximately 60 miles through the Southern Indiana hills). The trail then turns west diverging from the Knobstone Trail to return to the trailhead at Spurgeon Hollow Lake. The Spurgeon Hollow Trail is situated in the middle of the Washington-Jackson State Forest. The Spurgeon Hollow Trailhead is reached from a county road a few miles off state highway 135, then a half mile off the county road down a dirt/gravel lane crossing through a couple of dry stream beds.",

So I decided to just sit at the base of the tree to see if if the deer would come out of the brush, and hopefuly get a shot at it. After waiting for about 10 minutes it got pretty dark in the woods. Too dark to take a shot, so instead of spooking the deer, I decided to wait for it to move out so that I might have another chance at it the next day. It was making alot of noise, kind of unusual for deer. I must have set there for another 20 minutes when I heard this loud high pitch scream, or howl. It lasted for about 3-4 seconds and it was very close to my left. Needless to say, it scared the crap out of me! I have never heard anything like that before! I grew up around the woods and I have been hunting for many years, and never heard that sound before or since. I have been in the military for 16 years and spent my share of many different types of wilderness, and this sound that I heard I will never forget.",
