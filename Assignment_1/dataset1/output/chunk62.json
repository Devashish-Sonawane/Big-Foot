We were going around 60mph. My husband was on high alert for deer. We were just talking to each other when we approached the right hand turn off to Wyandotte Rd. My husband fell silent. He saw a very large, very tall, bipedal creature running toward the road from the left hand side. Within a split second I also saw this creature as it continued approaching the road at a full run. It entered into the peripheral of our headlights and came within 2-3 feet of the driver side window.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness names are Bethany and Logan Manning. I spoke with both of them by phone. They sound very credible and they run a landscaping business in the area.  They were traveling north from Logan's parents home in Stoutsville back to their home in Canal Winchester, 16 miles to the north of Stoutsville. Their child was sleeping in the back bench of the truck when the incident happened.Both witness are sharp and quite certain the figure was not a person in a costume. They are certain it was a real creature. It got close enough for them to see it clearly, albeit briefly. It was at least 8 feet tall.  The roof of the pickup truck is 7 feet 6 inches high. The creature's head was higher than the roof even though it was slightly hunched over when running. Why would a Sasquatch be in this area?  Answer: There are many, many deer in the area. The witness has collided with deer more than once on this road. It is likely this Sasquatch was in pursuit of deer. The road it crossed was Winchester Southern Road, which is the County line between Pickaway and Fairfield County, so the Sasquatch was crossing from Pickaway County into Fairfield County. There are many more sighting reports from Fairfield County than Pickaway County. The images below show the location of the incident.  The last image was sent by the witnesses to show exactly where the Sasquatch was seen. The creature ran out from wide gap between houses on the left side of this brick home.  Notice there are no fences separating the yards. Its easy for deer and other wildlife to run between the homes.   There are only a few homes in this area.  The remaining area are open fields and tracts of woods.Message from witness explaining this image above:\"Hi Matt, here\u0092s a map with detail about the positioning. the red line is the trajectory of the Bigfoot and the yellow is the 2 positions of the truck before and after it crossed behind us. Where they intersect would be when it was right outside the driver side window. \"Witnesses Logan and Bethany Manning",
