            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with the witness by telephone.She is a probation officer and feels she is a keen and detailed observer.The sighting occurred in late spring 1985. She is not sure of the correct month because so much time has elapsed.The witness was driving in her car traveling 30 MPH, it was 4:30 p.m.  The road was two lanes, approximately 20 feet wide.  At a distance of approximately 180 - 200 yards a large \"man\" walked across the road (right to left) and into a field.  The figure took three steps to completely transverse the road and the entire sighting lasted only two or three seconds.  It took the witness another several seconds to come to the spot were the figure walked into the field, but, he had completely disappeared from view.  She thought this very odd - that he had disappeared so quickly - as the field is as large as a football field and is used for hay, but also contains some small brush and a few trees.She described the \"man\" as tall and of a heavy build.  He appeared to be wearing dark coveralls.  He was hunched over as he walked, he turned his upper torso to look in her direction.  Facial features were obscured and dark.  The body was similar in proportion to a human.",
