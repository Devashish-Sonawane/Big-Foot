            "Observed": "Tonight March 16 2012, I was driving through the moutains of WV going east on Rt. 33 towards Virginia at 10 pm or so. I was out with my friend and I was driving. I took a turn and my headlights hit a figure walking along the road behind the guard rails. I'm 7 foot one but this thing was built, I'm tall but this must have been 6 inches to a foot taller than me. Though I was driving I was only going 15mph around a turn so I had time to see it. It was walking behind the guard rail and there is no way it was a man, it was way too dark out. Right after I saw it I pretty much had a panic attack. My pulse went up and started breathing fast and shaking. I never believed there was such thing as one but I am sure I saw one. I just can not believe how bad it scared me.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After conversing with the witness, the following details may be added to this report:-The witness is a very tall man, standing 7 feet 1 inch tall, and he describes himself as a bigfoot sceptic.-He was struck by the size of the creature he observed and knew that it was even taller than his own height, by several inches.-The figure was covered in black hair and walked quickly along behind the guard rail, as he passed by in his car.-It held its arms down to its sides while it moved and never turned to look at the witness' passing vehicle.-He describes the figures movement as odd, and unlike the manner in which a human would walk.-The witness drove with his windows down, and just before seeing the bipedal figure, he heard a vocalization that did not change pitch and lasted up to 6 seconds. It was so loud he initially believed he may have run over an animal.-The passenger did not get a good look and described what he saw as a \"black blur as they passed\".-The witness was immediately shaken by the observation and felt panicked. He was happy the figure did not turn to look at him as he's sure he would have lost control of his car.-The sighting took place along a stretch of Route 33 between the turn off to Switzer lake and the Virginia/West Virginia state line.This area has received an increasing number of reports over time, on both sides of the state line. The region is a rugged, forested and sparsely populated area of the George Washington National Forest, with all the resources and seclusion necessary to support a small number of sasquatch.",

I had parked my Pinto station wagon at a farmhouse close to an area of hills and forested area.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness reached out to me via telephone after he read an internet article about my Bigfoot investigations in the state of Ohio. He contacted the news source, which contacted me requesting permission for them to give them my cell phone number. The only reason he contacted me was because, his wife and him decided that their ages were creeping way up on them and it was time to tell of their encounter(s) as well as his father's amazing story. They felt these incidents needed to be documented now that the subject of Bigfoot is considered to be more of mainstream subject. After hearing their entire stories, I asked them to submit a report to the BFRO so I could ensure them it would be documented for many years to come. Figuring out what the town name was a chore and he initially thought it was Circleville. He hasn't been to Ohio since the 70s and his memory of the little downs that dot southern Ohio was obviously clouded. But after a good conservation and his mention of Bob Evan's Farm we both figured it out. They were so happy to finally be able to talk to someone that understood what happened to them. The couple has kept their story private for all these years telling nobody other than his father. His story did not change in any way when comparing the phone interview to the submitted report. This is apparently a case of disturbing a Sasquatch nesting area and being escorted out in a passive aggressive way which is very well noted in the Sasquatch field. Reading the report is just amazing in itself. Hearing his voice and feeling his emotions during the phone interview was very fulfilling. Fantastic report!The Marysville incident from the 1950s is also very interesting. Unfortunately, all the witnesses have been gone a very long time. ",
