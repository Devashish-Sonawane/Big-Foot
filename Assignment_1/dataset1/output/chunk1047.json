            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Jeff over the phone about his experience hearing vocalizations that closely resembled whoops he heard on BFRO's sasquatch-related sound recordings. This took place in the woods bordering his parents house on Camano Island, WA.  I asked Jeff if he felt there could be more than one creature making the calls.  Jeff stated that on several occasions he could hear a distant call in response to the one emanating from the area near the house.  This caused him to suspect there was more than just one of these creatures in the area.  He also mentioned that on one particular occasion both he and his father heard one creature call several times as it circled their house, yet it never left the cover of the dense forest. In closing Jeff commented that he would make an attempt at recording any future sounds as he suspects they will once again be heard during the wee hours of the morning and when the weather improves.In my opinion Jeff seemed to be honest and forthright in his statements and had no trouble recalling several events.",
