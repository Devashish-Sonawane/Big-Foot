            "Follow-Up Report": "I was visiting relatives in the area of this report when it was filed so I contacted the reporting witness and subsequently met him and one of the other witnesses at the sighting location. Both men recounted the events of that evening with eagerness reflective of the apparent excitement experienced during the event. The witnesses were 36, 43 and 45 years of age at the time of the incident. I met with them one week after the incident.The witnesses explained how they were on an evening bike ride along a designated bike/walking path when they stopped to rest upon completing the first half of the ride. They explained they try to take these late evening rides two or three times a week and always stop and hang out for a while before returning home. This area is in close proximity to the south eastern shoreline of Lake Ontario and is on the edge of dense woodland, wetlands and various waterways feeding to/from the lake.The specific area where they stop to rest is approximately 100 feet down a slight grade from an entrance/exit ramp at an interchange (clover leaf) of two roadways. The area leading up to the road is grass with sporadic small to medium sized trees and the other side consists of some woodland which surrounds a small pond. The witnesses were stopped on the path talking when one of them (the reporting witness), facing northward in the direction from which they had just come, noticed \u0093a shadow move closer\u0094 to one of the trees growing in the grassy area. It then appeared as if someone was looking out from behind this tree at them. He alerted the two others and they all agreed there was something odd near the tree at which time, one by one, they started towards it. I determined the witnesses were approximately 70-80 yards away from this tree and based on the height of a tree branch which was just above the figure, according to the witnesses, it was approximately 7 \u00bd feet tall.As they approached, they observed an apparent bi-pedal figure move from behind the tree and run from their left to right across the path to the wood line. One of the witnesses indicated the figure turned and looked in their direction while it was running but he could not discern any facial features. The witnesses followed and the figure continued along the wood line in a north-westerly direction for approximately 100 yards before it finally entered a larger, denser wooded area. They felt the figure was either grey or tan in color as it contrasted well with the darkness of the wooded area behind it. Some intermittent and residual illumination from vehicles and street lamps on the roadway above also enhanced their ability to see the figure. Upon reaching the point where the figure entered the wood line, one of the witnesses also entered for approximately 10-15 yards before stopping while the other two remained on the perimeter. They indicated they heard something moving through the woods away from them for 10-20 seconds and then silence. I examined this area and found nothing evidentially noteworthy. I am classifying this report as a Class B due to the visual obscurity created by the low light level and the lack of any physical evidence.",
