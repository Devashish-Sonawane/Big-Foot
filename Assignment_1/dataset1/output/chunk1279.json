We hiked up a well-traveled trail--possibly the Spruce Trail--and came upon a footprint of which I still have a picture.  It was a bare human-like footprint about 11-12 inches long.  Given (a) the modest size of the footprint, (b) the popular nature of the trail and (c) the fact that there were many \"hippy\" types in the area, I assumed it was just a very casual hiker.  But I took a picture anyway, with my boot for comparison.",
