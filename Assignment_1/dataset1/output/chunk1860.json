            "Observed": "I used to live in a rural town called Orient Illinois. There is only about 240 people living in the town. I was driving up Chicago Avenue to get to my house, Its a rural road that is paved and has a few homes on it but for the most part any area in Orient is the country. The neighbor boy was seated in the front seat with me and my 2 daughters were in the back seat. My daughters said they had seen it also but I don't know for sure because we were on a hill going upwards and they were pretty small in height, so I will tell you for sure the boy and I have seen it. We were going really slow because of deer at night, so while me and the boy we conversing on and off there from my side of the road comes a maybe 7 foot creature with the most beautiful chestnut long hair that covered all of its body just jogging across the front of my car crossing over the headlights. It used no effort to cross but it sure did cover allot of land in a very short time. Me and the boy watched it cross the car and go into the woods: then we looked at each other and kinda screamed, shouted to each other: Did you just see that? We answered each other at the same time and then I told the boy lets drive down the way and see if we can catch up to it, so we did, but to no avail. He had disappeared. He and I told each other that we will take it to the grave and forever it's our memory! I am a firm believer in Bigfoot!",

We weren't making a lot of noise, but we were joking around as usual and laughing a little bit, and not really paying attention to our surroundings. We were originally planning on visiting a spot where several large, thick blue berry bushes grew to pick some of the berries, until we rounded a corner to the right in the trail.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This young lady told me about this experience before she reported it, and I suggested that she report it on BFRO.net, which she did. I interviewed both her, and the other witness, separately and independently. The second witness was interviewed without knowledge of the interview of the first. The reporting witness accompanied me to the site, which is in Jennings State Forest, in NE Florida. We measured the distance from where they were standing to where the creature was, and it was approximately 100 feet. We also measure the height of the creature on a tree that would have been behind it, and the height was approximately 8'.  The creature was facing away from the witnesses, and neither described a visible neck or ears, or vocalizations. The second witness, upon interview, brought up thrashing sounds in the brush that attracted their attention, and the broad, thick shoulders, but that was not remembered by the first witness. The creature was facing away from them, and upon realization of what they were seeing, thinking it was a bear, they turned and fled. The first witness, upon becoming  recently informed about the bigfoot phenomenon, discerned that the creature was not a bear, because of its height, and absence of visible ears, and decided to report it. Both girls had vivid (though slightly different) memories of the overall incident, but both were certain of their descriptions of the animal. This investigator has recently photographed apparent tree formations within several hundred meters from the location of this sighting.",
