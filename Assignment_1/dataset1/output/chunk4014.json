            "Observed.1  ": "Middle-aged German men? No.   Well: maybe.  Probably.   But we were talking about Bigfoot. Red River was officially founded in 1895 as Red River City, and by 1900 discoveries of gold, silver, and copper had attracted more than 3,000 residents, who homesteaded the area in tents and cabins, and who established stores, newspapers, hotels, and ten notoriously rowdy saloons.  Famed outlaw Black Jack Ketchum allegedly patronized Red River\u0092s dances, and Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa purportedly gave his spurs to a local man whose wife used them to tie back her drapes.  From the 1920s on, mining gave way to tourism, and Red River soon became regionally famous as a four-season mountain playground, known for its skiing, and its trails.   In Red River, there are nightclubs, bars, and restaurants, Jeep tours to mining ruins, aspen groves, hiking and horse trails, and high country lakes that were first stocked in the 1920s by mules fitted with metal containers full of water and fish. .  In colder months, skiers and snowboarders fly down the trails of the Red River Ski Area, and every Thanksgiving they are invited to sled down on frozen turkeys.  In the summer, guests at the various chateau-style hotels can step out their doors, walk a minute to a chairlift, and ride up the slopes for startling views of the state\u0092s tallest mountains. But is the story of Red River actually much weirder?  As its history shaped it into the town it is today, was a race of legendarily elusive ape-men watching it all from the surrounding woods?  Were the hairy bipeds we now call Bigfoot striding just a bend ahead of the miners who searched for gold in the area\u0092s streams?  And do the red eyes of the Sasquatch watch skiers from behind snow-covered bushes?   Some people would have us think so. Since 1976, according to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO), at least 32 Bigfoot sightings have been reported in the state of New Mexico.   In May of 2000, according to that organization\u0092s website (BFRO.net), an anonymous wildlife biologist and professor was hiking with a group of \u0093two or three\u0094 unnamed students from an unspecified college, up a dirt trail to Middle Fork Lake, not far south of Red River, when he discovered a number of unusually large footprints crossing the trail. \u0093In shape and contour, the tracks appeared human,\u0094 he allegedly wrote on BFRO.net.  \u0093No details, such as toe impressions, remained or could be readily detected, but every indication was that tracks had been made by bare feet not boots.  ...The tracks were huge, at least sixteen inches or more in length and quite wide.  The depth of the tracks in the snow and soil was far beyond what I could duplicate; it was obvious, even to the students, that whatever or whoever made the tracks had immense weight....  As best as I could determine, the tracks appeared to be going in the direction of Bull-of-the-Woods Mountain [approximately eight miles south of Red River].\u0094 The report is interesting, but its credibility suffers from its total failure to name witnesses, by the failure of the professor and his students to make a cast of or even photograph what could have been one of the biggest scientific discoveries ever, and by its casual dismissal of any alternate explanations.  This particular case seems best explained by the tracks having been made by a hiker with a heavy pack, after which his or her footprints thawed and froze, thawed and froze, growing larger as a result.   Since 2000, there have been at least two other dubious reports of Bigfoot within Taos County, none of them very far from Red River itself.    One allegedly took place on September 27, 2006, reported by a 67-year-old Costilla, New Mexico man, Arturo \u0093Homie\u0094 Mart\u0092nez, who told of finding an unusual piece of aspen wood that he noticed bore a natural resemblance to a vaguely human face.   That, he said, occurred near the New Mexico-Colorado border, in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, and not long afterward, on a subsequent trip, he and a \u0093super friend\u0094 of his, drove further into the mountains, and discovered an aspen grove with the tops of a number of its trees unusually snapped off and then strewn all over the forest road as if to keep away intruders.  Mart\u0092nez and his friend drove around a curve, and a tire of their vehicle mysteriously exploded.  Elk were bugling in the distance, and then the bugling seemed to become a roar, and then...  Then, lumbering just inside the edge of the aspen grove, they saw something terrifying: a strange beast\u0097a bear-like creature, about the size of a bear, with dark, bear-like fur, walking hunched over on only  two feet, just as bears will often do for short distances, and they knew it could only be one thing: Bigfoot. \u0093I am convinced I saw what many call Sasquatch,\u0094 Mart\u0092nez later said, and he and his friend were so petrified by what they saw that they ran down the mountain, picked up a spare tire, came back in the dark to put it on their vehicle, and then decided to stay and camp there until morning.  The experience made such an impression on them, that one of the first things Mart\u0092nez did the following year was to tell a single reporter from The Taos News all about it.  (That story appeared in the paper on January 18, 2007, about four months after the incident. ) \u0093I decided to tell my story because America, wake up, these creatures exist,\u0094 Mart\u0092nez told the Taos News, but his story would carry a lot more weight if it wasn\u0092t so riddled with unconnected superstition such as the aspen face and the seemingly-supernaturally-flattened tire; if Mart\u0092nez hadn\u0092t neglected to bring a camera or tape recorder with him when he came back; if Mart\u0092nez and his friend hadn\u0092t counter-intuitively returned in the dark to scene of their alleged terror; and if Mart\u0092nez and his friend weren\u0092t already reputed to, at least according to area man Lee Vigil in Cryptomundo.com\u0092s comments section, \u0093have many stories of aliens, brujas and diablos who roam the high country in the Costilla area.\u0094   (It seems Mart\u0092nez may be to northern New Mexico what Ramon Ortiz is to the Boot Heel\u0097which means \"My Strange New Mexico\" won\u0092t be contacting him in person, for fear we\u0092ll have to threaten to get a restraining order against him eleven months from now....)  And a third incident, on October 2 and 3, 2006, reportedly involved a pair of anonymous hunters, camped out near Gallegos Peak, just under forty miles south of Red River, who heard \u0093a strange sound like scream/howl,\u0094 the apparent sounds of knocking or of two sticks being hit together, high-pitched \u0093vocalizations\u0094 like those of an unknown wounded animal, and smelled a smell like that of something dead.  One of the hunters also allegedly told BFRO investigator D.K. Warner that he noticed fallen trees near the site, trees that seemed to have been crossed purposefully as if to block their exit.  There's no denying that the account contains some frightening details,but to suggest them as evidence for Bigfoot seems to be a bit of a stretch, when at the story's essence, it\u0092s little more than an account of people hearing some unidentified sounds in the forest.    This report, like the anonymous professor\u0092s, and like hundreds of others\u0092 filed from all across the United States, fails to offer any actual evidence or credible sources to attribute the stories to, and suggests it\u0092s highly likely that these tales are as tall as the creatures they describe.  Taller, really.  In Mart\u0092nez\u0092s case, we have a story in which every detail hints at a more likely explanation\u0097from a treetop-shearing ice storm, to a bear\u0097and in the two other cases bookending it, we have no actual individuals to attribute the stories to, and so perhaps nothing that even needs explaining. Bigfoot may still be out there, sure, but no evidence seems to suggest that he is. Let\u0092s not rewrite Red River\u0092s\u0097or Taos County\u0092s\u0097entire history just yet.",

            "Observed.1  ": "A.: Because Bigfoots are thought to be intelligent species and they know they are being sought, so they know not to leave tracks. The only ones found are those left by mistake. Q.: How many Bigfoots are there? A.: No one knows for sure, but those who study Bigfoots say the ratio is about one per 1,000 bears. In Washington State, that would mean there are about 30 Bigfoots in the state. It is thought that they are in the Cascades, in Eastern Washington and in the Olympics. Q.: Are Bigfoot and Sasquatch the same? A.: Yes, Sasquatch is the Indian name often used in Canada for the large primate, whereas Bigfoot is commonly used in the United States. Q.: Why aren't there ever bodies or remains of Bigfoots found? A.: Many Bigfoot experts believe that Bigfoots eat the remains of the dead to hide the evidence that they are out there. The bones that are sometimes left behind are found, but not identified as belonging to Bigfoot, and are thought to be of other animals. Q.: How many sightings are there every year? A.: Hundreds are recorded throughout the world, including hot climates like Australia. There have been 3,500 recorded sightings since the early 1960s. But only about 5 percent are proven by experts to be credible. Q.: Why aren't there more photographs of Bigfoot? A.: Sasquatches are elusive. Almost any other terrestrial animal is easier to photograph because there are more of them and they are in predictable locations. Sasquatches are nomadic, nocturnal and extremely wary of humans. Their food requirements and social structures may force them to migrate from place to place on a frequent and unpredictable pattern. Nocturnal habits create substantial lighting problems for photographers. Requirements of night-vision equipment are too expensive for most photographers. Sasquatches also are not like deer, which freeze when light hits them. Rather, they retreat quickly into the brush.",
