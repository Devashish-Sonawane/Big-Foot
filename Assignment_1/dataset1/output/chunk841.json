The ground was covered in snow. We had exited Hwy. 4 at the snow-play area west of Bear Valley and proceeded along the road to Spicer Reservoir despite patches of shallow snow still in the road.",

My husband and I had 2 very large foot prints in our vegetable garden They were perfect because the dirt was just tilled for spring planting. The space between the foot prints was way to wide to be human. We didn't use plaster for an impression or get a picture, but we both know it was bigfoot. My father inlaw saw them too and could'nt explain them. It is kinda neat to think a bigfoot walked threw our yard right in front of our house. I wonder if they are up in the forest watching us work in the yard? We don't tell too many people because they think you're nuts. I'm pretty careful who I tell. It's been about 4 or 5 years now.",
