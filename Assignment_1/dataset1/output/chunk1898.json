We were on a one lane road, I pulled into a driveway to deliver a paper, as I was putting it in the box, my son [23 years old] says look dad a gorilla. I turned quickly to look. It was walking in the yard of the home towards the woods. We watched it for about 30 seconds as it left our view. I told my son there are no gorillas in WV. Thats a bigfoot. It was about 7 feet tall with long arms, like a gorilla. It didn't seem to care about us at all. It just walked away. It was very hairy. We both got a real good look at it. We both got goose bumps. It was about 4 am. It was in Sept. around the 5th. in 2001. We  looked every night in that area for the next 6 months, but never saw it again.",

The road is called 550 the road travels northwest out of the city of Marquette. The road runs parallel to Lake superior and many vast areas of dense forest, large rock, and \"boggy\" areas. There is an area by a large rock cliff called Sugar Loaf mountain hiking area, north of this area along the road on the opposite side of the road is Wetmore Pond area is a \"boggy\" marsh, a large animal that was covered in brownish/red fur head to toe, long arms and long strides walk/ran fast across the road, stood up on the guard rail and leap down on the other side of the guard rail. Due to the time of night and region I did not stop nor did I look back. It was not a person and it was not a bear. I have seen both and a bear does not run on two legs across the road. I have not reported this before, for fear that people would say yeah right.",
