The hair was a dark brown, long and slightly matted.  He didn't observe any neck and the arm length was longer than a humans.  He didn't observe any smell.  He observed the creature at approximately 4:30-4:45 pm, for approximately 5-10 seconds.  It was a clear day. The witness did state that he had hunted that same area for years. He never *saw* anything unusual but recalling back over the previous years he does remember hearing wood knocks, rock clacks coming from the two abandoned quarries nearby.  He also stated that he has heard from others in the area of several other sightings in the area.  A beaver trapper has had more than one.  ",
