            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on 8/24/2005:The witness observed the animal for 5 \u0096 10 seconds before running back into the bathroom.  She stayed in the bathroom for about 10 minutes before peeking out to see if it was still there.She described it as being close to 7 feet tall.  The top of the animal\u0092s head came almost to the top of the window which she judged to be 7 feet tall from the ground.The animal had a long torso, wide shoulders.  There was little or no neck observed; the head seemed to sit on its shoulders.  It was entirely covered with medium-brown colored hair.  The hair appeared to be six to seven inches long and gave the impression of being dusty.  Sunlight reflecting off parts of it gave it an almost whitish appearance.Note: bears have been sighted in the area.  However, the witness is certain what she had seen was not a bear because it was walking on two legs.The noise heard a couple of months ago (June, 2004) was a grunt-like growl that had elements of hissing to it.  It sounded as if it was only 30 feet away and was loud enough to be heard over the conversation.Below are other odd incidents that have occurred.  I am not suggesting at this point that these incidents are Bigfoot/Sasquatch related.  Nonetheless, I have included them as part of a comprehensiveness investigation and consideration by the reader and other researchers:1. The witness is missing a cat and another cat was recently killed - its hind-quarter was ripped open.  2. The witness says her dog has been exhibiting unusual behavior. The dog will stand at the window with its nose pressed up against the glass as if intently looking for or at something.3. A relative and her two year old daughter stayed with the witness this past summer.  The girl awoke one morning and said to her mother, \u0093mommy make the man in the window go away.\u00944. A tiki torch was pulled out of the ground and moved approximately 10 feet.  Laying next to the torch was an 18 inch shed snake skin.",

            "Observed": "I was archery hunting with my father. I have spent a couple of weeks a year in the area sinc the time I was born. I personally have heard the sounds of Bear, cougar, coyotes, elk, dear, bear hunting hounds  and basically all other wildlife in the area. It was nearing dusk and my father and I decided to each head a different direction on the High Cascades hiking trail near Boulder Lake and just a little South of the Badger wilderness area. We had decided to go for about 20 minutes and then return back figuring to return to the car around dark. I headed north following the trail into the fringe of the Wilderness area. About 10 minutes or so in I heard a yelping kind of sound. It wasn't anything I have heard before. The closest animal sound that I have ever heard would be like a chimpanzee, but much deeper. It was not human sounding by any means, but more human than say a cougar or bear. This sound intrigued and scared me. I followed the trail a little further, I then began to hear a sound that I can only describe as being the sound of wood being torn open, not a rotten log mind you, but the sound of wood splintering on a massive scale. This was a bit troublesome, but I pushed on a little further, my curiosity pushing me on. The trail made a slight bend to the right emerging from a small thicket of Fir trees and angling down the hill fairly steeply. I could see that there was a bit of a drop about 150 yds ahead of me and a log laying across the top lip of the drop. That's when saw something. It was a head and shoulders, with the back turned towards me, just beyond the log. There was no visable neck at all, but the head was clearly defined above the shoulder. I stopped and watched, I started to think it was just a stump and my eyes and instincts playing with me. I took another step forward and then it moved. It's movement was like when you hear something and you cock your head to try to align your ears to catch the sound better, but the whole torso swiveled, just a couple of inches. That was all I needed to see, I backed up the trail until I couldn't see it anymore, then turned and walked as rapidly as I could till I got back to the car. My mom and wife were waitng in the car, and both said, \"what happened to you?\" My dad came back about a couple of minutes later and he commented that I was white as a sheet. Honestly I was terrified, something there was not right, at least it was different then I had ever expearienced",
