In winter the river will have water in it, but if someone is going to go out there, the river is dry in summer.

            "Observed": "Dear Sir, I am a paranormal researcher/investigator and freelance writer, with a special interest in Bigfoot. Five years ago I interviewed a group of young people regarding a sighting. The sighting took place in the Mojave rive bed in Hesperia California. The first report came from five teenage boys who were exploring down in the riverbed late in the after noon when a noise in the dense under brush that grows in places along the river startled them.",
            "State Population Density": "217.4",
            "Follow-Up Report": "On the 9th of November 2002, I met with George S. at an overlook site that lets you view most of the area where the sightings took pace.  While viewing this area, Stacy G., the young lady that made the 1997 sighting, rode by on her three-wheel ATV, and I got to meet with and interview her.   Stacy\u0092s interview:The reason that Stacy was looking for this creature in the first place was the fact that her brothers came running home shouting about a hairy creature that had chased them out of the river bed, and they were scared to death.  On her second outing, she was coming home in the late afternoon and observed what she called a monkey man walking parallel to her at about 75 to 100 yards away, close to the tree and brush island that was located in that dry river bed.  She observed that the knees were slightly bent as it walked. It then stopped, turned, and looked at her. She and it, the creature, faced each other for a little under a minute.  She could not really understand what she was seeing, standing about 75 to 100 yards away. She noticed that the face was black, but she couldn\u0092t make out any facial features except to say the face seemed round and had some hair on and around it.  The height seemed to be about six feet tall and it was a dark brown in color with long hair all over its body.  The arms seemed extra long, its back was very straight, the head seemed large and it had no ears showing.  The creature then turned and disappeared into the underbrush, walking then crouching. Stacy went home and tried to convince her family and friends just what she saw but all thought her a little strange and  laughed it off as a joke.  Stacy also stated that during that same time period her family and neighbors were losing their pets and livestock like pigs, ducks and geese, but they never put the sightings and the disappearance of their animals together.  She also observed that her animals became very quiet at night and seemed frightened.  George\u0092s interview:George now says that his horses still refuse to get close to that area, and he also stated that people have seen and heard things in that same area during the recent past, like several months ago.  He seems to think that the most active time of the year is around August through September.  Per George, there are several trout ponds with ducks and other wildlife just north of this bedding area in the Mojave River.  George is the one who found the bedding area and a footprint impression down in the riverbed close to where Stacy had her sighting back in 1997.  The footprint was about twenty inches in length and about eleven inches wide, so there may have been more than one creature staying in that river bed.  Stacy also observed a footprint; she described it by using her hands as about fourteen inches long and about eight inches wide.  George and Stacy both described the bedding area as a carved out area under the thick brush and said that it seemed like it would have been very comfortable for almost any animal to sleep on.Review:After interviewing both parties, George and Stacy, I believe what they told me was the truth.  I think that Stacy saw a young creature, maybe like what we would call a teenager, because it was so careless with its encounters with humans and the size of the footprint she witnessed.  Stacy thought the creature might have been a male, because she did not see any mammary glands on the creature\u0092s chest.  With George\u0092s footprint being described as much larger, there is a good possibility there might have been more than one creature living in that river bed.",
