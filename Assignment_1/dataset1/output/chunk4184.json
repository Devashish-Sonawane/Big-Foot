            "Observed.1  ": "Perhaps it\u0092s not actually a monster. Maybe just a mountain lion. Police have heard no such freaky reports. But haven\u0092t you ever seen monster movies? Police are the last ones to know when a monster comes to town. A bit of local scuttlebutt says something big and scary was spotted in the Spoon River Bottoms area, just north of the Peoria-Stark county line. Plus, it\u0092s said that one cow\u0092s calf recently disappeared without a trace near Wyoming. Creepy? That\u0092s nothing compared to 1950 and the Perdelwitz Monster. Fred Perdelwitz farmed Peoria County land between Princeville and Laura. Perdelwitz told Peoria County sheriff\u0092s deputies that over a few weeks, a mystery marauder had snatched and gobbled 40 pigs, four cows, 26 sheep and countless chickens. Actually, Perdelwitz hadn\u0092t actually witnessed all that predatory poaching and feeding. But he swore to the disappearance of all that livestock. And what sort of creature could boast such an appetite, other than some sort of ravenous monster? Yet one night, he told police, he\u0092d set out a deer carcass as bait. In the dark, he caught a \u0093fleeting\u0094 glimpse of the beast, which, after spotting Perdelwitz, bolted away with a loud roar. According to a newspaper dispatch at the time, \u0093An appeal, the sheriff said, will be made to all big-game hunters in this area to gather at the Perdelwitz farm and settle the matter once and for all.\u0094 Two such hunters, along with Perdelwitz, mounted horses to try to nab the beast. The found tracks as large as a man\u0092s hand \u0097 no further description ever reached the press \u0097 but found no further clues. And as quickly as it reared its hungry head, the Perdelwitz Monster vanished. There were no further sightings. Until recently. Again, these are sightings. It\u0092s not like someone has The Son of the Perdelwitz Monster locked up in his backyard shed. Yet. The sightings have been in the area known as the Spoon River Bottoms, in Stark County just north of the former Perdelwitz farm. Seven years before dying in 1987, Perdelwitz sold the land to a farmer named Tom McGava, who playfully dubbed the spread Cougar Ridge Farm. Though he sold the property the next decade, son Andy McGava is familiar with the territory and still lives in the area. McGava, 51, is a former state-licensed expert in nuisance wildlife control. He says, \u0093If you have raccoons in your attic, I\u0092ll get \u0092em out.\u0094 The other day, a friend called about nuisance wildlife, but not raccoons. Bigger. The friend and another man (McGava knows him as well) were driving in the Spoon River Bottoms one night when they stopped \u0097 and spotted a pair of bright eyes staring back at them. \u0093They claim they saw a mountain lion and had it in their headlights for several minutes,\u0094 McGava says. \u0093Several minutes.\u0094 Neither party moved before the critter darted off. But the friend, who raises livestock nearby, discovered days later that a calf had disappeared. \u0093Big cats hide their evidence,\u0094 McGava says. \u0093At least, they try to cover the remains of their prey.\u0094 Not that he is totally sold on the notion of a mountain lion or any other intruder roaming the area. \u0093I need some hard evidence,\u0094 he says.  Then again, he notes that predators are mixing it up with people more and more. A bobcat was killed by a car in Toulon in 2005. In 2009, a black bear was captured in Bureau County. Since the turn of this century, at least 10 wolves have been trapped or killed in northern or central Illinois, including one in Marshall County in 2002. And a cougar was killed by police in Chicago in 2008, marking perhaps Illinois\u0092 most out-of-place wandering. Except, of course, for the legend of the Springdale pterodactyl. So, maybe a mountain lion is slinking through Stark County? \u0093Anything\u0092s possible,\u0094 McGava says. I wanted more info, so he said he\u0092d pass along my number to the big-cat witnesses. So far, no call-back. And they didn\u0092t contact police. Otherwise, the sheriff\u0092s offices in Stark and Peoria counties have fielded no recent big-cat reports anywhere, including the Spoon River Bottoms.. \u0093Over the years we have,\u0094 says Joe Needham, chief deputy in Peoria County. \u0093But not recently.\u0094 \u0093Recently,\u0094 eh? Maybe a mountain lion has learned how to lie low near the Spoon. Then again, maybe it\u0092s not a big cat. Maybe it\u0092s something else. Like, the Perdelwitz Monster? Back and hungrier than ever? Maybe the Perdelwitz Monster hibernates for 70 years (give or take a few) after a big feeding, then awakes to hunt anew. Or, perhaps it got fat and lazy \u0097 it happens to the best of us \u0097 and slipped up recently, thus the eyes-in-the-headlight sighting. Hard to say. Well, not for McGava, who announced on Facebook, \u0093The Perdelwitz Monster has arisen! The mysterious killer seems to have migrated north and settled in the ... Spoon River Bottoms!\u0094 Is his post serious? \u0093In a way, it\u0092s serious,\u0094 he says. \u0093In a way, it\u0092s a gag.\u0094 The latter partly refers to his jest about the big-cat witnesses: \u0093It is not known if they were imbibing spirits, as they are known to partake in a social drink now and then.\u0094 I visited the area twice this week and spotted nothing. Then again, I\u0092m a weenie: I stayed inside my car. I\u0092m not about to trudge along any river bottom in the hope of going toe-to-toe with a monster. Meantime, McGava isn\u0092t sure what to make of the reports by his pals, who are setting out trail cameras to try to grab a glimpse of the creature, whatever it might be. As for the original call to McGava regarding nuisance wildlife, he says he is ready to help in whatever way needed \u0097 monster traps? \u0097 if the cameras find anything. He sounds pretty calm, not at all like his over-the-top (and tongue-in-cheek) warning on Facebook: \u0093Beware, residents of the Wyoming-Toulon-Bradford area! Lock down your livestock, your pets and small children! Arm yourselves! Be prepared to protect and defend what is yours. You have been warned! \u0093Stay tuned for further developments as this story progresses.\u0094 I couldn\u0092t have said it better myself. Phil Luciano is a Peoria Journal Star columnist.
