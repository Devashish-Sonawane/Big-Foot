At first, Peiffer was reluctant to discuss it with his family. \"He thought we would would make fun of him,\" Mrs. Peiffer said. Lowell Adkins, a hunter, later found 10 inch tracks near the carcasses of four partially eaten turkeys. Some think the tracks were a bear's, possibly a black bear from northern Wisconsin or Michigan. But no one in Jefferson County recalls ever seeing a bear in the area and until the mystery is solved, some parents aren't letting their children go outside after sundown. \"It was just before dark and I was driving past an old deserted farmyard when I saw it,\" Mrs. Olson said. \"To me, it looked like it had a monkey's face and kind of had hair all over.\" \"I didn't tarry too long,\" she said.",
