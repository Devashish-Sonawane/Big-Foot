            "Follow-Up Report": "This sighting took place in Franklin County, near Hagansport, TX. I spoke to the witness on 9/06/2002. The witness was with a friend, walking along the Sulphur River, hunting arrowheads. The Sulphur River runs through an old rice farm at this point. It was late afternoon around 5:30 pm. It was a sunny day and very hot, near 100 degrees. The two got separated and the friend decided to head back to the truck. The witness was walking along the shoreline when heard what sounded like a boat splashing in the water. At approximately 200-250 yards away the witness spotted a stump along the opposite shore line. Then the stump started moving. At first he thought it was a black bear. The animal had not yet seen him. The sun was setting behind the witness. This could have been why the witness had not been spotted. The witness then climbed up to the dam. The dam is located on the southwest side of the bank. The animal was on the northeast side. Once on top of the dam, he was 190 yards from the animal. It appeared to be sitting on his knees soaking in the river. Its arms were floating on top of the water. The wind was blowing towards the witness. He smelled nothing but dead fish. The area behind the animal has a pond with carp trapped in it. This area has a food and water source and woods.

            "Observed": "My girlfriend and I were standing in a graveyard on a ridge top in Eagle Rock, VA. on Dec 24.  It was rainy overcast day at approximately 4:50 pm.   We were paying respect to my families graves when all of a sudden we heard a guttural call sound come from about, what I estimate, 100-150 yards away, if that far up the mountain from us. It was low and lasted several seconds. There were 3 distinct calls in the initial call. My girlfriend looked at me and said, \"what was that?\"  I started to answer her with an \"I am not sure\" response when it called out again, 3 distinct calls.  She said, \"is that Bigfoot\".   I said \"I am not sure, I grew up in the woods  and Had never heard anything guttural like that before and I have heard a lot\".  I could see the fear in her eyes.  I looked around and told her, I am not sure what it is but look at all the dogs, they know exactly what it is.  There was a very large dog about 100 yards away over the ridge, that was frozen in place and staring in the direction of the sound.  There were 2 other dogs, one on a chain on the porch of a house and a hunting dog on a chain about 75 yards away from us.  Both of those dogs were frozen in place looking in the direction of the sound.  Not one of the dogs barked.  The hunting dog was the closest to the sound and it was still and quiet.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After conversing with the witness, the following details can be added to his report:After listening to several audio recordings, including those from BFRO Report 32981 out of Michigan, the witness felt the vocals he heard were most similar to the 1994 Ohio Moaning Howl, and that a \"moan\" more accurately describes what he heard than the term \"call\" that he used in his report.He describes the vocals he heard as low in pitch, similar to the Ohio Howl. And he notes the howls repeated three times, which is similar to moan howls captured in Ohio, Michigan and Washington.The low guttural howls sounded as if they originated 100-150 yards away, up the mountain from where he stood with his girlfriend.   They were low in pitch and lasted several seconds each. There were three distinct moan howls and before the witness could respond to his girlfriend the vocalizer called out again, repeating the three moan howls. The witness grew up in the woods, is familiar with all the vocalizers typical of a Virginia forest, but had never heard anything similar to that low, guttural howl.  The witness saw the fear on his partner's face, and then took note of all the dogs in the area, which had gone silent and were staring intently toward the source of the howls.The witness attempted to mimic the howl back at the vocalizer, just once, and after ten seconds of silence the vocalizer responded with a single moan howl.The witness attempted to get closer to the vocalizer by driving his car up the hill, toward a water tank, near the origin of the howls. But once there his girlfriend convinced him not to get out. No more sounds were heard, and eventually the dogs relaxed, suggesting the vocalizer may have moved on.",
