            "Observed": "Two creatures. . .walked upright.  Hairy from head to toe.  One on the east side of the road in the woods, the other in the field on the west side of the road.  I was eight years old and in Cub Scouts.  Five other boys and I were fishing near a house on Rolland Road, 12 miles west of Mt. Pleasant.  A crash of a broken log alerted us to the one in the east.  It was a largre dark figure, crouching in the woods.  We ran like h*ll to the house and when we came out an hour later is when we saw the other in the field.  We knew it was another one because it was lighter in color and you could still hear crashing in the woods.  It walked strange, with the momentum of it's whole body.  It was a long time before I'd go back down that road.  Not until I was sixteen would I ride my bike along there.",

The witness lives in Detroit now, just happened upon the BFRO web site, and decided to post the report.  In speaking with the witness, we have several mutual acquaintances, including some of the family that lives on the farm he referred to in \"Other Stories\"  (Although at the time of the incidents I did not know them).  Additional follow-up will be done with updates posted if appropriate.",

            "Observed": "On 3/29/2014 at approximately 9:42 pm (I know this because of cell phone records) my daughter and her friend and I were coming back from a trip to Manhattan, KS on Burmac Road between McPherson and Burrton, KS after the S curve in the road.  I remember seeing the lights of a home in the distance and out of the corner of my eye I saw something white.  When I turned my head the large white animal was running at a high rate of speed towards my car.  It looked like he was going to hit the passenger side of the car.  This animal was gigantic, when it ran into the ditch it still looked taller than my car which is a 2009 Dodge Caliber.  It looked like this white animal was flying through the air at a high rate of speed.  When it hit the ditch we got a great look at the face and the features and its size.  It was really fuzzy, especially in the face and it had dark sunken eyes and a mouth that was not visible and the nose was not distinct.  The most memorable feature was the eyes....they were very black. It was on two legs but when it approached the ditch it used its front hands/paws for leverage.  It seemed extremely muscular and fit. When I first saw it, my daughter and I were talking, she had just said, omg my phone just died....I saw a flash of light and looked and said what the heck is that........?  My daughter said I don't know and she started screaming.  At this point she said she saw three images the first sighting for her he was on all 4 appendages the second time he was on two legs and the last time he was at the window.  We all agree that there was a ton of fur...!  When I thought it was going to hit the car I grabbed the steering wheel and jerked to the left.  The fur was about six plus inches long and had a weird pattern, I only say this because I am a cosmotoligist and hair growth pattern matters.  When I jerked the steering wheel to the left I almost went in the ditch on the left side.  I looked back but it was gone.........nothing was in my rear view mirror.  I instantly called my ex husband and left a voice mail and that was at 9:42pm he called back at 9:45pm and then told him that what we had witnessed 20 years ago I had just seen again only bigger and without the teeth!  He said I was freaking out and he was right!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I had two lengthy conversations with the witness and obtained the following, additional information. As they were heading north towards home, the creature ran from right to left. There was a farmer tilling his land at night and there was a large fire burning in the tree line. This was not a controlled burn, but a wildfire, as we were in a burn ban warning in Missouri and Kansas due to the bone dry & windy conditions. She felt the creature was fleeing the fire. She saw the fire on the right side of the road, then turned her head back to focus on the road, and then suddenly the creature was upon her. Her daughter screamed first, then she saw it an instant later. She caught a \"white blur\" out of the corner of her eye, and as the creature approached the right side of her car, she swerved to the left, knowing she was going to hit it, (or it hit her). She saw the head, mostly side profile, through the front passenger door window. The head \"filled up the entire window....huge....huge\".  She noticed the white coloring, and described the hair as \" spiked, punkish, teased, or sticking up like it had been gelled\". She is a cosmotologist by trade and notices everyone's hair by habit. Eyes were huge and very black against the white hair. By her estimate the creature was at least 8 ft tall at a minimum. As it was running towards the car (crossing the road), it was on all fours, then stood up as it (braced for the impact with the car ?), then went back to all fours as it hit the ditch on the drivers side of the car and went up the incline and disappeared. She, and the girls knew it was going to impact with the car, and just didn't. Regarding the sighting mentioned that she had twenty years prior. She said the creature was in a ditch by the road next to a dead deer (road kill?).  It had blood all over its mouth, face and chest. It never stood up, just looked up, and then resumed eating. This one was also white, but smaller.  They kept driving. No report was filed on this earlier sighting.",
