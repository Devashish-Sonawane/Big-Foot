            "Observed": "I am about to graduate with a BS in Biology, and want that noted. The incidents began in the fall of 2004. It started out as hearing strange howling sounds in the evening. I never heard the vocalizations in the day time.  In the fall of 2004 some friends and I went camping on my driveway. It was the middle of October, and around 2 in the morning I heard a loud grunting sound and trees snapping. The noises were so loud that they woke me up. It was a full moon that night and clear, and when I opened the window on the tent I could not believe what I was seeing. I saw a large dark figure with eyes that seemed to illuminate red in the moonlight. It was beating something in the head which I found to be a deer come sun up. The creature drug the deer up to the top of the hill above the camp sight. It walked up on top of some big rocks and I could make it out perfectly. 8 to 10 feet tall and covered in hair. The one friend who stayed the evening saw the exact same thing. I watched it eat the deer. It pulled off appendages like it was nothing. Shortly after it started eating it noticed our tent. It walked right down to the side of the tent, and the smell coming off of it was intensely musky. It knocked the frying pan out of the tree by the tent as it was walking by, and when it hit the ground, it ran back to the top of the hill. The deer carcass was gone, but hair and intestines were left behind. The liver, spleen, heart and lungs must have been eaten. We followed the drag marks from the carcass and found a mass of pine trees bent and broken into some form of shelter. I have many other encounters that I can share. They are real and they are here. I have had rocks thrown at me, and I have been charged by one twice. I barely got inside the house both times. They do not like light, and they do not like it if you shine a light directly at them. I say them because on more than one occasion my fianc\u00e9 and I heard at least three. Hardwoods and swamps surround my house. When this started there were many subdivisions going in, and massive habitat loss which had to drive them to my property. There is also a 20,000 acre national forest that is squatchy as all get out about 7 miles from my home. The sounds are not as frequent now, but they can still be heard from time to time here. I only hear them in fall and winter though. I am also a hunter, and when I was hearing the Squatches every night, there was not a deer to be found. When I did see deer they were very jumpy. This was during archery season that I made this observation, therefore no gun shots were occurring to spook them. I promise you from the bottom of my heart that they are real. I have seen them in person more than once. If the wind is right you know when they are close because of the smell.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a biologist and is familiar with all local animal sounds. I found him to be very articulate, credible and knowledgeable.  He lives in a very wooded and rural area of Georgia.  Around November of 2004 he began hearing strange howls. He knew they weren\u0092t coyote. The howls always began around 11 PM at night, and many times they heard more than one creature. A few years later while watching a bigfoot television show he heard similar howls. The sounds could be heard from November to spring - for several years. Just during the cold months. In November of 2006 he was having trouble sleeping and went outside in the carport for a smoke around 4AM. Everything got very quiet and then he heard a \u0093snarl\u0094 and a big branch breaking very close to him. He heard \u0093huffing,\u0094 then a 18 \u0096 20 lb bowling ball size rock was thrown toward him. He ran inside and armed himself in case something followed him inside.A few days after that he let his 70 lb dog out at about 10:30 PM. His dog walked about 15 yards began growling and his hair rose up. He heard a \u0093huff,\u0094 and he turned a 15 million candle power spotlight in the direction of the sound. Standing in the open less than 100 yards away was an 8-10 foot bigfoot. The creature turned his head trying to deflect the light in its eyes and snarled as it had before. It then charged towards him and the dog, starting on two legs, then switching to quadrapedal, then back to two. Both he and his dog ran into the house. He grabbed his firearm again, hoping it would not enter the home. He never looked backward to see how close it came to the house before it stopped. Other details he noticed:-It was dark brown and had a lot of gray around its face.-The eye shine was amber colored.-It had a prominent brow ridge, and its hair did not fall below that.-It nose was flat and wide.-The shoulders were very broad, \u0093like a football player with pads on.\u0094-It\u0092s hands hung below its knees.Three weeks after that, he let his dog out again at about the same time. The dog once again began growling. He shined the light and the creature was there but much closer. It \u0093huffed,\u0094 and once again charged him, this time staying on two feet the entire time. The witness believes it was the same bigfoot as it had the same pattern of gray hair framing its face. When it got to within 20 yards of him, he shot his gun to the right of it. He did not wish to shoot it, but only scare it away. The bigfoot turned away from the gunshot, and ran through a flower bed, breaking an overhead branch as it ran by towards the creek. Because it came within 15 feet of him he was able to see it more clearly. He noticed the genitals and could tell it was a male. Its back had more gray than the rest of the body, and it reminded him of a \"silverback gorilla.\"The next day he and his friend followed the path they thought it took. About a mile away they found a lean to like pine structure. A pine tree had fallen, and several pine branches has been Teepeed around it to make a shelter. He smelled a \u0093skunky-dog-like odor.\u0094 The shelter was about 5\u0092 high, and large enough inside to fit more than one bigfoot.The area where the structure was got clear cut in 2008. Since that time the howls have been few and far between, and they sound as if they are much further away.He has a memory of when he was a teen. While camping with his friend on his property, he was awakened by loud thumping noises. He remembers it was the October full moon, so he was able to see very well. When he looked out the tent, he saw a tall, dark figure about 45 yards away hitting something on a tree. He also smelled a very foul odor. He watched the figure carry something large up the hill and then it sat down. His friend woke up at that time and questioned him about the odor. When his friend spoke, the figure got up and walked down to the tent. Both boys held still and were very quiet as it walked around the tent. The odor became much stronger then. They watched it walk over and look at the skillet he had hung in the tree. Earlier that night they had fried bacon and eggs in it. The creature then walked off.The next morning, they went up the hill to see what it had brought up there. They found the remains of a white tailed doe. The hide and ribs was left. The intestines were pulled out, and the skull was totally \u0093flattened.\u0094 The 20,000 acre national forest he referred to is the Oconee National Forest.",
