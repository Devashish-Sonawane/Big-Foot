            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the sister [the primary witness] at length, who I will not name in the report. She told me about her encounter in 1986, and I found her to be very reliable. The witness, her brother, and a friend drove up to a piece of property in a rural area with an old abandoned farm house. The house was built on the side of a hillside. The young men were in the house, and she had come out to walk back to the car. The weeds on the property that she had to walk through were five to six feet tall. As she was walking, she heard something large coming behind her through the overgrown weeds. It showed itself at about three or four feet away. In her words, she thought that she had seen a gorilla that had escaped from somewhere. It immediately went up the steep embankment that the house was built on and disappeared. She had only natural light from the moon, but can not recall if it was full or not. The creature was black, with red eyes. When asked if there were any other details, she had said it looked like a gorilla, and that during the bluff charge it was on all four limbs like a gorilla. While on all fours it was taller then her, and she is 5'7\" tall. She confirmed that it was definitely not a black bear, and that she has seen bears in the wild. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After communicating with the person I found him to be honest and forthright about his experiences. He is also a school teacher and likes to take long walks around his property with his dog. His report is very self explanatory and I only have a few details to add to this investigation.He and his wife live in a small, rural housing development and his backyard looks over a huge swath of heavily forested land. There is also a good water source in the form of a small lake or pond directly behind the housing development. He has seen many different varieties of wildlife including mountain lion, black bears and lots of deer.When I spoke to the witness he described the high pitched shrieks of the first incident as being similar to a metal beam being ripped apart by a powerful force. He also stated that he has listened to the BFRO Sound Recordings page and would describe them as similar to the 1973 Whoop-Howl from Puyallup, Washington but \"ten times louder\".The first incident  occurred in August of 2012 and the witness added that after the screams stopped he noticed that there was no wind, clouds or overcast and that it was unusually dark and quiet.The second incident occurred at the beginning of October. He heard two of the high pitched screams and then 10-12 whopping sounds followed by a response whooping sound and then nothing more.The third incident occurred during the middle of October in which he only heard two sets of whooping calls some distance away and also dogs barking wildly.In addition to these three incidents the witness told me of a fourth incident in which he was again awakened around 3:15 in the morning to a series of whooping sounds and dogs barking wildly from an estimated 1/4 of a mile away. This happened at the end of October of the same year.The experience has caused him to be very uneasy and wary of the area and his surroundings so much so that he obtained a Concealed Weapons Permit and purchased a very high caliber handgun. He now carries it with him every time he walks with his dog. He has spoken with his neighbors and no one has heard any of these types of noises.The environment includes a good source of water, an abundance of deer, and other food sources.",
