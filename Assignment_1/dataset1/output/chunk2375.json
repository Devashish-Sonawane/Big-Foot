            "Observed": "I believe that I saw a Bigfoot in Oregon back in the 80's. I was with my parents and sister on a camping trip somewhere south of Crater Lake. It was around 9:00 p.m. and had been dark for at least an hour. We all went to bed; my parents slept in the trailer and my sister slept in the camper and I got to sleep in the tent. We had all got in our spots with the tent about 15 feet from the trailer. I crawled in my sleeping bag and could here my parents voices but couldn't understand what they were saying. I could also hear a couple twigs snap. At first I thought it was a squirrel but then I thought; they aren't out at night. The terrain is flat with small pine cones and tons of pine needles covering the ground. We were the farthest campground out and national forest all around. The closest campsite to ours was about 60 yards away and there was one guy in it and he had a great big bon fire going.",

The following details can be added to the report.--When the witness first saw the figure, it was turned sideways and he could only see from the shoulders to the waist.--The creature was not overly massive but not skinny either.--The witness looked for prints the next morning, but the ground was covered in pine needles.",
