            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness on the telephone. He was driving home to Vernal from Manila.  He travelled this route several times a week. He first noticed the eyes reflecting in his headlights. When he first saw the animal he thought it might be a black bear, so he stopped the pickup truck, backed up and positioned the vehicles headlights to shine on the animal. It was standing in the trees five feet off of the road.  The witness was surprised at how calm the animal stayed, even with a noisy diesel stopping and backing up. He was impressed with how much ground the animal could cover as he watched it turn and take ten steps before disappearing into the trees.  He saw that it had long, black and grey hair that was very matted and wet from the snow. No details of the face were seen. The witness was believable and familiar with the area, he has lived in the area his whole life and has hunted and fished a great deal, very familiar with the outdoors. This was his first sighting but several members of his family were loggers in the Uintas, which border Flaming Gorge, and always told of seeing and hearing these animals.",
