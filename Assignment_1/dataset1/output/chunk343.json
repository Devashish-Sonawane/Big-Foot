            "Follow-Up Report": "8/26/06: I spoke by phone with the witness, who seems very credible, and has 25 plus years experience outdoors in the Everglades.  He and a friend were dressed in waders and intended to night fish a small creek/runoff along SR 41.  They were greeted with a very loud (like a \"bullhorn\") low pitched scream, almost a growl, which lasted for approximately 10 seconds. The witness felt strongly the scream was meant to send a message to not come any further, but was not a threat or an attack gesture. No unusual odor was noted. Despite briefly shining flashlights in the area, no visual evidence of a creature was seen, even though it seemed to be very close (few feet away) by the audible intensity. The witness did not feel any human could make a noise that loud, and had never heard any noise like that before in his years of being in the Everglades.  The vegetation was very dense on either side of the water including oak, sawgrass, and eucalyptus.The witness also spoke of other observations in the general vicinity over the last 20 or so years. He and the same friend saw what they thought was an orangutan high in a 40-50 foot tree from a distance, but it had disappeared when they approached the area, and no details of color, hair length, or specific size were noted at the time. He also relates as a teenager (about 25 years ago) seeing a large (estimated 15-18\u0094) human-like footprint (with toes) far back in the swamp about 7 miles down a gated dirt road, with vehicular access limited to Park Rangers.  More recently, he notes seeing several smaller footprints that were human-like but much more wide and \u0093blunt\u0094 at the toes. Within the past year he notes discovering a crude \u0093shelter\u0094 alongside a canal with 4-5 trees on one of its sides bent over and inter-twined with 2 or 3 trees on the other side. He believes the trees were placed this way, and feels there is no way these trees could have accidentally formed this structure. As he was passing by this area, he remembers a strong smell of \u0093urine and wet deer,\u0094 and was concerned he may be surprising an animal (he was thinking deer at the time) in the vegetation so quickly left without investigating the structure any further.  The bent-over trees were in a shallow valley, sheltered from the wind, and no other trees were bent over around them as might be after hurricane winds.  11/16/06: Update.  On 11/03/06 witness went back to general area of previous track sightings to relax and fish.  He discovered a large solitary track in moist soil next to a canal.  Track appeared to be a left foot, with a large toe and three smaller toes, with the last (fourth) digit angled off to the side of the foot about 45 degrees. Track was on level soil, with no evidence of sliding. The witness purposely made an impression with his size 10 boot in adjacent soil for size and depth comparison.  Track size estimated to be 15\" in length and 4-4.5\" at the heel.  Track impression was about one inch deep, slightly deeper toward the front of the print, in the direction of the canal which was about one foot away. The witness boot impression was 1/4 inch deep, and witness is 215 lbs.  He estimates track was no more than one or two days old, with no debris except for small stone inside the track. He also noted many deer, panther, and hog prints in general area, and believes the canal is a source of water for much of the local wildlife. ",
