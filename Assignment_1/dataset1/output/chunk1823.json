Being a new residence to Washington at the time I had no knowledge of any ape-like creatures in the woods.  I can remember it was an early Wednesday morning and heavy overcast with snow still clinging to the shaded areas. We ended up first on a black-top road which gave way to gravel that became extremely narrow and twisting as we climbed higher into the mountains.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness, John, in a telephone interview was able to give more detail of what he observed.John grew up in the tropics and had heard of bigfoot, but had no interest in the subject. John surfed, dove and fished in the ocean in the tropics and was developing an interest in fresh water fishing once he moved to the Seattle area. He was looking for a lake he had heard about from a friend that was supposed to be an excellent fishing spot. It turned out to be harder to find than he had anticipated so he stopped by one of the streams he had crossed.As John and his son approached the stream, his cocker spaniel came slinking back to him. By the stream he saw what he thought was a \"big man\" that was squatting. The color was grayish with some brown. When the animal saw him, it stood up from its hunched position and straightened. John was amazed at the size of the animal. He estimated the height to be a little over 7 feet.  John has been courtside at professional basketball games and said the size of the creature was similar to the biggest ball players. The animal had long hair dangling off its arms and the same long hair covering its torso. John said he remembers seeing that the hands of the sasquatch were red with what he assumed to be blood & that it looked like it was pulling at the skin of a dead animal when he came upon it. John's impression was that he was in the animal's territory and that it was \"standing its ground.\" He said he felt threatened.At the sight of this, John fell backward, hurting his leg. He and his son beat a hasty retreat back to his car - without his fishing gear. The animal then proceeded to scream at John, which he described as a shrill and piercing sound. John grew up in the out of doors, but after this incident he was \"bothered for weeks.\"John had previously been in the woods near Gold Bar when everything went deathly quiet. He said it distinctly reminded him of when he was diving in the tropics. John said that when a shark comes near, all the marine life departs the area or hides and there is no question that an apex predator has entered the scene.",

            "Observed": "First, a little information on me.  I am 36 and grew up in western NY; where I spent a lot of time hunting, hiking and camping in the woods. I spent four years in the US Marines, where I spent most of my time in the field. Every year I return home for deer season.  In 1993, I went deer hunting in Clearfield County, PA.  My Uncle (a long time resident of Clearfield) took us out to some state game land outside the city of Clearfield.  We traveled in on a old horse trail and went our seperate ways.  My Dad and I walked a couple of miles in from the trail.  I dropped my dad off in a meadow, told him that I would pick him up after dark and walked about 3/4 mile further in.  I found a nice valley and set up for the evening hunt.  The valley was surrounded on three sides by a step snow covered 200' hill.  About an hour into my hunt, I heard a strange distant noise.  It was very deep and repeated every so often.  I could not place the noise with anything I have ever heard in the wild, but didn't pay much attension due to its distance.  I continued hunting and listening to the noise.  I started to get a little nervous, when the noise began closing on my location.  It was covering distance extremly fast, and I still couldn't place the deep belch like noise.  Being well armed (Winchester 30/30 rifle and a Ruger 45colt sidearm, I still decided to pack up and leave as dusk was approaching quickly. By the time I had packed my backpack and got it on my back, whatever had made the noise was directly at the top of the hill above me.  It stopped making the noises and began breaking branches off of trees, just inside the wood line.  At this time, I had my Winchester at the ready and was watching the steep snowy ledge in front of the tree line.  For the first time in my life, I was afraid to be in the woods.  I felt as if it was trying to intimidate me out of the valley.  I stood there for about ten minutes on gun shaking, as it moved back and forth in the woods breaking branches.  Now it was getting dark and I was terrified, but knew I had to move.  I got a bearing on my compass and began moving quickly toward my Dads position.  As I left the valley, I didn't hear anything again and just kept moving. When I found my Dad, I rushed us back out to the horse trail.  Once at our vehicle, I asked him if he had heard anything strange.  He advised that he heard the same noise in the distance, but payed it no mind.  At the truck I nervously waited armed for the rest of our party, and didn't relax until we reached my Uncle's house.",
