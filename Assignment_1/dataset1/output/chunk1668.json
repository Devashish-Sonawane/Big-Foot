            "Follow-Up Report": "Our phone conversation happened on 9/12/06He saw this animal across the lake off to his right at about 200 yards. At first he thought he was seeing a dark brown bear drinking at the edge of the lake.  He called to his girlfriend to look and then the animal stood up. He knew then that this broad shouldered muscular frame was not a bear.  They turned and retreated up the bank stopping to look back.  At that point the bigfoot was moving back from the water facing away from them.  They watched it for a few seconds as it seemed to bob sideways as if it was looking at something through the trees in another direction.  They left the camp in a hurry and never returned and never spoke to anyone about it.The height was a rough guess. He guessed it was 6' to 7' tall.  He was impressed by its muscular athletic build.  They watched it for a total of 10 seconds or so.",

After several hours of hiking came to a large clearing of flat rock that jutted out over a fishing hole in the creek.  The entire area of this clearing was littered w/clothing some very old that appeared to be from the 1970's.  Some of the clothes were in the trees and some were piled around the rock area.  It was very creepy.",

Thinking that it was one of the members of his group taking a bathroom break he went back to sleep.  After questioning his companions the next morning they all said that they did not leave there sleeping bags all night.  When my grandfather would back pack there as a young man, he would describe what he called \"spirits\" walking and hiding in the tall grass at night.",

            "Observed": "I was 17 and on a back packing trip with my family in Grizzly Creek canyon. It was night and we were sitting around the campfire talking.  Suddenly a foul smell came into the camp site. Smelled like a combination of rotten meat, body odor and musk.  Our dogs went crazy barking and growling staring past our campfire behind the tent.  We could not see anything.  Suddenly we heard extremely loud, and extremley close vocalizations coming from just outside the ring of light made by our fire.  The sound was unlike anything we have heard before.  It was NOT a mountain lion or an elk.  It is hard to describe the sound. It was gutteral and it undulated sounding like something was strangling a goat.  It vocalized 2 or 3 times each time the sound started slow and then built in intensity.  My dad grabbed his gun but didn't fire.  After a few more minutes the smell disapated and the dogs calmed down.  I have never been more frightened in my life, and remember wondering if I would live through the night.  The next morning we expolored the area where we felt the sounds were coming from.  There was an area of smashed grass behind a large boulder approximately 15 -20 ft from our tent but nothing else significant.",

            "Follow-Up Report": " After a lengthy phone interview Paulina described the events to me as she had stated in her report adding just a few things.    She said her family had been camping in this area for many years, and that the younger children always sensed an uneasiness when entering the area. The canyon also seemed lacking in wildlife during that time.    Paulina said she thinks this occurred in June of that year, but cannot recall the exact date. They found the clothing scattered about to be unusual  in such a remote location, and stated it did not look like a homeless persons camp, but was completely disorganized with some clothing hanging up in the trees. Later that night after returning back to camp, they all heard the vocalization near the camp.  She sensed that the vocalizer was letting them all know it was unhappy with their presence in that location. There was also a strong odor associated with the vocalizations.     I asked Paulina to listen to the vocalization samples from the BFRO website and see if she could find anything that would be close to what she heard that night. She stated the one particular vocal exchange from  Ron Moreheads \"Sierra Sounds\" link (http://www.bigfootsounds.com/)  called \" Quarrelsome exchange between two after food set out 21 October 1972:(Corresponding CD Sound Sequence)\" http://www.bigfootsounds.com/excerpt2.mp3 was the most similar to what she had heard.   She also added that her grandfather who had camped in the location for a number of years has commented in the past that sometimes his clothing and small items would disappear from that campsite. He blamed the raccoons and porcupines although he never witnessed one carry anything off. ",
