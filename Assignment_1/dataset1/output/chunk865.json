I asked him to post his report to the BFRO, which he has done.  The event described in this report contains the same details that I was given during the original phone interview.I am familiar with the location and have investigated other reports of encounters in this area, that I have received in the past few months.  I have made night forays to the area and observed that even the smallest tent-light is visible at considerable distances and campfires are easy to spot.This is a popular area for hikers, campers, and off-road enthusiasts as there are numerous Forest Service roads and trails, and many small lakes.I do believe that had there been other campers in the area, their light sources would have been visible.I believe this Gentleman is a highly experienced back-country hiker and outdoors-man, very familiar with the wildlife of this State and not prone to exaggeration or jumping to conclusions at the snap of a twig.The sounds and sensations he reports are consistent with what I have had others report.",
