While camping after setting out their turtle lines the witness had an unobstructed view of the animal.  The distance was between seventy five to one hundred yards.  He describes the animal the animal\u0092s height from seven to eight feet tall.  He was unable to describe features due to the distance and the darkness.  He did go on to describe the animal as having a mound on his shoulders when I asked about the neck.  He also states that the animal had a dome shaped head.  Throughout this encounter he only saw the animal in profile.    The witness is able to describe the arms and stated that they were hanging into the water.  He further states that he thought they were helping to propel the animal through the marsh.After the first encounter the witness states that the forest became very quiet after the vocalization occurred.  There were no noises including crickets, frogs or dogs.  The habitat in this area is rich.  Besides the marsh, Lake Erie is close by.  There are also farms, orchards and vineyards in the area.  ",
