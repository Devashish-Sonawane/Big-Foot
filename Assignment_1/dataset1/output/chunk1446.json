            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted this witness 6/1/11 via phone, he then e-mailed these pictures and I found them intriguing. I shared these pics with my peers who are more learned than I on the subject and they also found them interesting. But some red flags were raised about how well defined the toes were. So on 6/18/11 I drove to the sight  and met the witness,where the pics were taken and studied the consistency of the soil and the surrounding area and found that the ground was very clay like. The density of the soil was when moist (not wet) was the same as drying fine grain concrete, like when kids would leave their hand print and and write their names. I took my own shoes off and found a moist piece of ground and it left the same well defined type of print although different of course as the ones in the pictures.  It was at the mouth of a state wildlife refuge of 2000 acres of marshland and forest named  Belle Slough. The witness impressed me as  being honest in account of the event.The foot prints were approx. 9 inches long and approx. 6 inches wide. As to the question of what if these prints were faked? The only argument that I can come up is: if someone wanted to hoax a \"Bigfoot \" print then why didn't they make it ..bigger?Picture of the tracks taken by the witness.",
