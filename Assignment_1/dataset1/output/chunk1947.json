            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to this witness and felt he was very sincere about his report. He remembers the encounter vividly.  He was traveling east on US 2 and was somewhere between Manistique and St. Ignace, not too far from  I-75 when this incident occurred.  When I asked him about the traffic he said, \"I was it\".  There were no buildings or houses nearby. He was traveling at roughly 80 mph when he noticed something in the road with its eyes reflecting red.  He did not slow down at first because animals on the road late at night will normally move off the road as a vehicle approaches ... but not this particular animal.  Only when it appeared that he would collide with this animal did he slam on his brakes.The vehicle he was driving was a yellow '75 Chevy Nova with a hatchback.  The type of vehicle is relevant to the incident because it helped the witness estimate the creature's very tall height. Once his vehicle stopped he was amazed that he had not hit the creature.  This animal towered above the vehicle, only a short distance from the vehicle.   Hair on the face kept him from seeing normal facial details, except for its \"beady eyes\".  When I asked if he saw any skin or additional details he explained that everything was covered with hair and that additional details could not be seen.To the left was a forest of pine trees.  To the right was grass for about a football field's length, ending in pine trees.  The creature headed south toward the trees on the Lake Michigan side very quickly and crossed the field of grass in no time. By the time he had the spotlight out the creature was looking back just before entering the woods and disappearing.He insists that this creature was 10 - 11ft tall.  This reported height is not uncommon.  When witnesses become terrified during  close-range encounters with these animals, the terror is usually not driven by the behavior of sasquatches, nor by their hair-covered appearance, but rather by their overwhelming size ... which is most fully appreciated at close-range.Refer to the following witness sketch of a close-range encounter on an Army base in rural Georgia.The BFRO has received many credible reports over the years describing close range encounters with sasquatches that were  approximately 10ft tall, and some that were over 10 feet tall. \"Red\", especially when used to describe hair color, means  different things to different people.  When I asked him to compare the color to a different animal, he stated that he has seen redhead women with a similar color, closer to red than orange. He said the creature was on the skinny side but still healthy looking. He mentioned the hair seemed clean and neat. He described the hair as \"fur\" rather than \"hair\".  He mentioned that it was very tall, skinny and lanky - comparing its body to that of a skinny basketball player. This witness has seen bears and is very adamant that this was not a bear, stating to me \"it had no snout\". His impression was that it was a mature male sasquatch, but again no additional gender-related detail was noticed, due to the hair.The creature turned to look at him a total of three times. Each time it turned its head to look at the witness, it did not turn its body, but rather only turned its neck and head.  I questioned him about this and asked him to clarify, because many witnesses describe these animals as turning their whole upper body to look \"over the shoulder\".  The upper-body turn is visible in the Patterson footage, and may be a characteristic of smaller, stockier females, rather than taller males.  This witness was positive that he saw independent neck + head movement as it looked back at him. The witness was able to gather himself enough to get his spotlight out, plug it into the cigarette lighter and aim.  It worked very well and he lit up the creature, getting one more good look just before it looked his way and stepped into the trees.I asked him why he stuck around.  He told me that because the creature was leaving the scene, he was able to calm down a bit.  Wanting to get a better look from a safe distance he got out the spotlight. He was also hoping his wife would wake up and see it. Once the wife did wake up and he described the creature to her, she insisted they leave immediately.I asked him what was going through his mind at the time.  Having heard stories of bigfoot and being a non-believer before, he said he was trying to figure out how a large creature looking like this, could get away with living and thriving in our woods for so long without anyone ever knowing about it.
