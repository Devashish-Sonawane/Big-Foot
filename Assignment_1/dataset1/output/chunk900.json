            "Follow-Up Report": "I have interviewed the witness by telephone and find her a reliable witness with keen observational skills.   She and her husband have lived in this area for years and are aware and knowledgeable of all forest sounds.  The long moaning howl she describes hearing is one other researchers are familiar with.  You can go to the BFRO main page and look it up under the Sounds section.  It was recorded by Matt Moneymaker [founder] and Jamie Watson in Columbiana County Ohio, 1994, here is the link:  \"1994 Ohio - Moaning Howl\"The witness described the howl as starting off low, then rising in pitch and volume, into a long drawn out mournful cry.   The length of which she stated was approximately 50 seconds.    It was heard only once before she decided to go inside and lock the doors.  As he report states her normally fearless dog, was not inclined to investigate, but rather wanted nothing to do with it and came to  her side.  This type of reaction from a normally territorial dog has been reported before.This area has had an upturn in reports over the past few years.
