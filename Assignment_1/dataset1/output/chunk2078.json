I was checking to see if the deer had been eating the cracked corn I left them.  Most of the corn had been eaten. I turned around to look back towards my truck and next to the gas well road was a large tree that was about 30 feet off the road. Next to the tree was a very tall, wide shouldered, very built, dark brown, hairy creature standing next to it.  The creature had pushed a fairly large branch away from its face so that he could watch us.  All I could do was stand there for a few seconds which seemed like hours staring back at the creature.  My girlfriend finally asked what are you looking at which made me quit staring. All I could say was get in the truck.",
