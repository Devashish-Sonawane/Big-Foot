Not only that but the area is a regularly used fishing, camping, picnic area and boat ramp and it would break my heart if people stayed away from it because of me.

            "Observed": "Father:  I was driving to go fishing with my son, at a local fishing spot. The place is on the Cass county side of Lake Wright Patman. We were around a mile or so from the lake I would say. As I topped a hill and a slight bend I spotted a big black bear in the road. I stopped because bear in the area are rare. I had never seen one in the area but heard stories of them. I was excited because not only I was getting to see it but my son as well. Then very quickly the bear stood and turned toward us and to my shock it was not a bear at all. It was a huge thing not a bear. The thing was I would say between eight to ten feet tall, three and a half to four feet wide at the chest and shoulders. It had a large head with dark eyes either dark brown or black, a big flat nose and the face was a little lighter brown than the body. It was not black as I first thought but a dark brown almost black and its fur or hair was around four inches long. It looked like a guy who spends all his time in the gym. It had fists around the size of a canned ham, I say this because one hand was closed in to a fist and had something in it. I think it may have been male, because it had no breasts and might have had a bulge in the crotch area, but I wasn't focused on that. I am a religious man and have the light of God in my heart and Jesus is my lord. I immediately believed I was looking at a demon. I question that now, after talking to people who seem to know a lot about these things, and reading a lot over it since I saw it. Think me mad if you will but I slammed the vehicle in park, jumped out and started preaching gospel at the thing. I don't know if it is a demon for sure or not but either it is and the word of God hurt it or it just didn't know what to make of me, because it roared at me so loud and deep I could feel its vibration, like a teen's car radio. It threw what it had in its hand, it flew a few feet above us and a good long way back up the road, then it turned and ran with otherworldly speed. This all happened very fast, I could not say how fast but from the time I stopped till it was up and gone was not long at all. I stood there a moment longer thinking I just saw a demon. I got back in the vehicle to drive back and see what it threw at me. It was part of a cotton mouth with its head and who knows how much of it missing. I chunked it in the back and went home. During all of this my son had been screaming at me to get back in and let's go and he was freaked. He did not want me to stop when I turned around and was pushing me to go as fast as I could. I was not scared because a demon not dare confront a man of God. Yet now I'm not so sure that it was a demon.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "My initial conversation with the witness was a little slow in getting started.  The witness was naturally apprehensive in speaking about his encounter as he was concerned about being ridiculed for his beliefs.  I assured the witness of my respect of his beliefs and opinions and advised him that no one is ever prepared for an encounter and anyone who has an encounter will react based on a preconceived notion, belief, action or a prepared training.  Additionally, some have a non-action.  They are a little frozen by what just happened to them and in most cases witnesses have post encounter reactions.  Some occur in days, others occur in weeks, months or even years later, and almost all who have an encounter with the unknown get their definition of reality challenged.  The witness said he felt comfortable with our conversation and agreed to meet me and show me the exact location.  I encouraged the witness to share our conversation with his son for the very same reasons he and I discussed and encouraged him to see if he would be willing to come along. I was able to meet with the witness and he took me to the exact location.  I have included pictures of the area that have been closely cropped with markers removed.  The witness has a genuine concern for public safety and does not want unethical researchers visiting the area:Where the \"bear\" was first spotted:Reenactment of where it was and its stance before it stood and turned:This is where it ran into:The witness bestowed me a gift of the remains of the snake that the creature threw toward him.  I am including a picture of the snake.  Unfortunately it was preserved in pickle juice & alcohol.It appeared to have been ripped or chewed into.  Unfortunately, his son decided not to join us.  The witness said his son was concerned about possible ridicule and just really wanted to put the incident behind him.  I went back to our conversation of possible effects due to an encounter and the witness said that during the encounter, his son had been pleading with him to get back in the car.  The witness then explained a little about his professional background in law enforcement and corrections and said he guessed his training is what led him to get out of the car in the first place.  The witness is a large man and can cast an imposing presence himself.  We discussed that I was not surprised that he responded the way he did.  His training, study and physical ability all contributed to his response and now after having some time to think and talk with someone he has come to the conclusion that they are physical beings.  I advised that his son may have to go thru some more time and if so, myself or anyone in the BFRO would be available to talk with him.The area of the encounter is sparsely populated.  There is an abundance of forest, creeks, streams and wildlife.  The area is known for its watermelon production. Food sources are in abundance.  The area is in proximity to areas of OK and AR; both rich in sighting reports.  I found the witness to be credible and did not sense any attempt at deception.  ",
