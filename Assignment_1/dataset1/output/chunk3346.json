A couple minutes later I heard 3 deep grunts. At first I thought it was maybe a big buck Grunting for a doe but the more it kept grunting the more I thought it was maybe a rapid dog. It was making alot of noise as it came closer to the opening to cross to the other side of the pinetrees. It stopped just a few feet from the opening to the path. It just didn't feel right so I didn't even draw my bow. I remember grabbing my knife for protection (I was in a tree stand but kept thinking the \"rapid dog\" would bay me in the tree!). After what seemed like forever I heard the most blood curdling scream as it jumped acrossed the open path and into the other pinetrees. All I remember was saying to myself \"oh my God it was on 2 legs.\" It took only 3 jumps to cross 20 feet.It was starting to get dark and was about 50 feet from me, so I couldn't tell the color or features. All I remember was that it was big and only on 2 legs. It kept screaming (like a bobcat scream or a little child's scream) and was running so fast into a big wooded area.",

She looked left, right and briefly ahead.  Before beginning her turn she noticed movement directly ahead on road 1100 N.  She saw crossing the road from left to right,(heading south) approximately 250 feet ahead, two large, black, hair covered figures, taller than an average man walking on two legs at a hurried pace.",
