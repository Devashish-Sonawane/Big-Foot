            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.The witness lived on ten acres with her husband for one year. The nearest neighbor was two to three acres away. Tracks were found before and after August 30th: three total on a deer trail and one on the other side of their property. The tracks were fifteen to sixteen inches long, six to seven inches wide, with five toes. The first or big toe was huge. They all left a flat foot imprint. Screams, always at night, were heard for two months before August 30th. The neighbor was at their cabin once and also heard a scream. He did not want to walk home as the vocalization came from between the two properties. On August 30th, the stump that was pulled straight from the ground had a root ball two to three feet across. There was five to six of them placed in a row.  On another road on their property, the witness saw a big straight figure with long wavy dark red hair. Its head was wide, but short from chin to forehead. It was two car lengths distance from her. The eight to nine foot tall figure quickly turned and ran. She saw a huge, long left arm swing like a pendulum. Three to four whoops were heard, then movement, then three to four whoops again. She described a lingering smell like the combination of manure, urine and dirt. That night, starting between nine to ten o' clock and lasting until midnight, it sounded as if sticks were hitting the cabin. Whoops were heard again and a scream lasting three to five seconds. The husband was very nervous. The next morning, sticks were found all around the cabin, four to five inch diameter and twelve or more inches long. The husband placed a peanut butter sandwich on the truck hood and a pine cone was found in its place. The husband kept doing this and pine cones would be found most times. Once, several little sun bleached white sticks were in a row. For two weeks the witness felt as if she was being watched. At these times she would say, \"I am almost done with evening chores.\"The owners had a chicken pen with no roof. Trees were used instead of fence posts. The chickens would sleep in these trees. Once, the witness heard branches breaking by the chicken pen and found three to four inch diameter broken branches. The chickens moved higher in the trees to sleep. The property owners had Chihuahua dogs that would often bark and hide inside the cabin during this two and a half month time period. They would call to their gray tabby cat but there would be whoops and screams. The cat would meow at the sounds and then finally come to the owners.A few weeks after August 30th, the cat went outside and never returned. After that, vocalizations and other activity ceased. During this time, the witness noted a lack of coyotes on their property. Coyotes had always been there. Also during this time, the owners left the top of the hill alone. She said, \"He got the top eight acres.\" I found the witness very observant and credible.Witness does not know current owners of the acreage, so does not know of any further activity.  ",

We heard splashing in the big pond to the west of the gravel road and went to check it out. On the far southwest corner in the water up to it's chest was a sasquatch slapping the water. The water is way over my head at the place were it was. The size of him and depth of the water clearly indicated it was not human but something much larger. R. and I ran to a near by friends house and told them what we had just seen.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This was the first report brought to my attention the school year after that summer (96-97 school year). I spoke to Z.O. at that time in 1996 and his story has never changed or been embellished in any way to this day (winter 2001). R.C. testimony was the same. I have also spoken to the friends who were at the house where they ran too. K.D. (friend) told me they did not believe them at first but soon changed her mind hearing and seeing how scared they were. Both these boys were and still are known as tough guy's hunters and atheletes at the local high school and they would have nothing to do with going back down there that night to check it out.R.C. is a very skeptical about almost anything, with a show me type attiude. He firmly believes in the existence of sasquatch as does Z.O. after their experience. Both young men are experienced hunters, woodsmen and fishermen.",
