I grabbed a stick and started to hit the tree to see if I can get the squirrel to move out of the tree. I sat there for a few minutes and walked off. I walked away from the tree and heard some knocks off in the distances. I thought it was some thing else so I kept on going. I walked for a few more minutes and I looked back. There was something behind a tree looking at me. It was about eight to nine feet tall. I had no idea what to do, so I ran away.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "High school student on an early morning hunt was surprised by a hair covered upright observer. The witness was on an abandoned logging road and observed a squirrel cross the pathway. He picked up a stick and knocked on the tree trunk in an attempt to force the animal to leap to another tree. His efforts were unsuccessful, so he began moving to another area. He described having a feeling of being watched. His sixth sense caused him to look around and he noticed a 7.5 foot figure peeking from behind a tree. It was not the tree he had knocked on but not far from it. He saw the face details, stating it appeared human like but with flat features. One hand rested on the tree below its face, with all other details hidden by the trunk. Faced with a creature he had never seen previously, flight ensured. The animal did not vocalize or throw anything at him during his exit. I am confident the witness saw a sasquatch that morning. ",

My uncle and I spent 12 years exploring the back country of Challis, Salmon, and Stanley, Idaho. Our ultimate goal was to find a way to drive into a chain of mountain lakes called Hat Creek lakes at the base of mount Tayler. We decided to do some exploring past Yellowjacket mine on FR 112 rd. We camped at the end of the rd. at a very small hunters camp at Middle Fork Peak in the Yellowjacket Mts. We set up camp that evening and was just getting ready to fall asleep when the most hair raising howl, scream, grawl I ever heard in the wild. I asked my Uncle if he heard that and his eyes were wide open with a quick \"yes\". Then suddenly the same scream came from the oppisite direction of our camp only a little more distance.",
