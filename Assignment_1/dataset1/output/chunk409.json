            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness who recounted his story as presented in the report.  The vocalizations occurred near Knoll Crest Trail and Plunketts Road off of Buford Drive.  The witness described the vocalizations as being very loud.  The witness is very familiar with the vocalizations that various wilderness animals make including those of bobcats and mountain lions.  He stated that the vocalizations that he, and the other witnesses, heard that night were unlike anything he has ever heard before or since that time.The next day the witness investigated the area where the vocalizations originated from.  In this vicinity he found an area where something had \u0093torn through the woods.\u0094  He said that there was a pathway of destruction, or \"hole through the woods, about the size of a small car,\" where small trees and saplings had been freshly knocked down, as if something was trying to make a point as it depated.  Trees that were not knocked down had their tops twisted and broken off and thrown to the side. This area has seen considerable development in recent years. It was much less developed in 1999.",
