Follow about a 1/2 mile and just before a bridge across \"Horse Creek\". There should be a driveway just to the west of the bridge and on the north side of Lost 40 Rd. This driveway leads back onto the old Lost 40 property which was some years ago bought out by the city of Springfield for the Lake 2 project. As such, this may be public land now.  The area of the sighting occured about 100 -150 yards up the driveway/north of Lost 40 Road just to the east of the driveway and west of the creek.",

            "Observed": "This was circa 1978. As my friend and I were walking from his house along his 1/4 mile driveway that meandered through the woods along side of the creek we had heard some odd noises that caught our attention. At this point, we had been running through the woods for a few years together, felt extremely comfortable in them and knew many sounds and sign. Neither of us could identify these sounds. I do not recall the sounds exactly, but, it seemed to be some tapping noise, somewhat subtle and not alarming, yet it seemed clearly something out of the ordinary. So we decided to hop the old overgrown fence which paralleled the driveway, penetrate the overgrowth and go into the woods to investigate.",

The trail lasted approx a couple hundred feet ... We saw Elk prints and the 'footprints' seemed to occasionally jolt to the side... As if it were trying to jump onto a fish or duck...  The prints were very large... The water in the lake there is way too cold to walk through....",
