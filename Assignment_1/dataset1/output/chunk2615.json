Around 7pm yesterday evening, 1/9/2021, I went out on my porch to listen to coyotes (which I hear some nights), and about a minute after the coyotes stopped I hear a very high pitched wail or moan that was in three intervals, each with higher pitched succession, coming from the next mountain ridge to my east. The tone, and duration of the wail or moan, was unlike anything I have every heard, and sounded out of place. It did not sound like the normal coyote sounds. It was very strange and made the hair on my arms stand up. I live in a very remote region of the Appalachians, about 15 miles southwest of Lexington, VA. I am an avid outdoorsman and an expert with most animal sounds in the region. I could not identify this sound.",
