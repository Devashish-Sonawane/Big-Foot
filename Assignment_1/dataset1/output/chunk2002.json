            "Observed": "My husband and I where sitting on the front porch one evening when what I thought was a bear caught my attention on the edge of the tree line. I told my husband to look at the bear and he stated that was not a bear because it was to large. We continued watching for approximately two minutes when a deer darted out from the tree line. The dark mass I thought was a bear then stood up and chased the deer into the woods. My husband and I looked at each other in disbelief at what we had just saw. It was too far away to get great detail of the animal but close enough to tell that it was very large and dark brown / black in color. After seeing it chase the deer on two legs back into the forest, I knew instantly that no bear could have ran so fast and so graceful on two legs.  The next evening my husband went to the same spot in the tree line while I stayed on the porch so we could compare the sizes between the animal and him. My husband is 5 foot 10 and what ever we saw was at least 1 and 1/2 - 2 feet taller than he was.",
