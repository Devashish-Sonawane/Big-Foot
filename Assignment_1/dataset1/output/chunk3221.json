We also share it with Brown County State park And Yellow wood. I was basically star gazing... I hear a loud howl type sound, that I have never heard before; I grew up here, so I know what coyotyes, wolves, foxes, owls, and even bobcats sound like...THIS WAS NOT ANY OF THOSE! I have never heard this sound from here???? There was one short howl... it sounded like it was right in front of me no more than 140 ft. I moved a few paces to my right and again I heard a howl in front of me, as if it moved to the right with me...this time after the second howl there was about four or five short hoops after it! By that time I was really freaked out and ran back to my house!",

The howls lasted about 3-4 seconds each, and were similar to the Ohio howl found on the website.  After the howls occurred, she heard a series of high-pitched whoops come from the same area. She stated that the day before she heard some very loud tree crashes during the day, but didn't think much of it until she heard the howls the following night. ",
