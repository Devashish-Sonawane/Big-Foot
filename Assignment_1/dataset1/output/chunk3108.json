This is the tree that was found lying in the yard the next morning: The witness had previously submitted another report, see: Report # 38337 I spoke with both the witness and her brother by phone. Although the home is on private property belonging to a family friend I was able to drive by along the highway and confirm all distances of the report.The witness emailed me several photos taken in leaf litter and as such were not of sufficient quality to see defined footprints. \u0095 The animal stood taller than nine feet. \u0095 The witness could not judge the weight, saying only that it was huge.\u0095 The hair was solid brown all over.   \u0095 There was an overpowering smell of stench.\u0095 The animal was very close to the witness' bedroom window.\u0095 The distance to the tree, that was found lying on the ground the next morning, was 100 feet from the house.

I was lying low in our hide providing over watch while my team member attempted to move in to within approximately 75 yards of this camp. It was at this point when three distinct knocking sounds spread no more than 1 second apart, were heard from our 6 o\u0092clock position. The distance appeared to be within 100 yards. After a very short pause of about three, maybe five seconds, there was the sound of a large branch or small tree breaking in half. The noise was so loud that everyone in the camp grabbed their flashlights and searched the tree line towards the direction of the sound. We were almost compromised by this noise, but as quickly as the sounds were heard, the forest fell silent. Unfortunately, no one was able to further investigate those sounds due to our focus being the exercise and not the wild life.",

But this report serves as independent and remarkable corroboration of a compelling incident previously reported to and investigated by the BFRO. The BFRO remains very interested in other possible sasquatch encounters in the vicinity of Fort Picket, and encourages anyone with similar experiences to submit a report at their earliest opportunity.
