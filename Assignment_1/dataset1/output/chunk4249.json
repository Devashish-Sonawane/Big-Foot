He said he saw an erect creature, covered with hair, with finger like hands and measuring 7 to 8 feet in height. Herrington no longer is with the sheriff's department. FIGG, reluctant to talk about the sighting, said when he checked it out it was not in his official capacity as a deputy sheriff. He is a Sasquatch buff and has read much literature on the subject. Pat Gallagher, Grays Harbor County sheriff, said no report of the sighting was filed with the department. Figg, resident deputy at Pacific Beach, said his daughter and the two friends \"saw something, but I don't want to say what it was.\" THE GIRLS reported what they saw as at least seven feet tall with liver0tipped hair all over. It first loomed in front of the headlights of their car, they said, then ran erect on its hindlegs behind the car. It was supposed to have been kept secret, Figg said. He said he didn't want to get involved because of the furor over the sighting report a year ago.",
