            "Observed": "It was early one morning, probally around 6:00 am, and i was up and decided to go into the kitchen and wash dished from the night before while my children were asleep.  We were renting a house right off hwy 100 in Hickman County.  It was an older farm house and had several acers of fenced in land back behind it.  About half way in the middle of this field behind the house, it was crossed fenced from one tree line across to another tree line.  So, after I had finished the dishes I walked over to the back window in the kitchen.  I looked out and right past where the feild was cross fenced, I saw something walking.  I took a second look because I could not beliece what I had just seen.  It was a very large creature walking as if it were in a big hurry to cross the field to get to the trees on the opposite side.  It was tall enough that I could see down to it's legs over the fence.  It was a tan color with places that were darker as if it were wet or muddy.  It's hair was long on it's arms and on it's face.  I could only really see it's eyes and nose for the hair.  when it passed a break in the fence, I could see that it's legs were also covered in long hair. I watched it until it disappeared into the trees on the other side of the field.  I had even ran from the kitchen window into the bedroom window to watch it.  I never went down to look for tracks that it might have left because I was too scared.  And I also never told anyone for a long time because they might think that I was crazy.  They still to this day think that I am crazy but I believe what I saw was the real thing.  I believe I saw bigfoot.  And I will always say that I did.",

It swung its arms as it walked.\" Although the witness still lives in the same area, she has had no other sightings and is unaware of anyone else locally who has.",

            "Observed": "I remember the year well enough. It was in the summer of 1980. The reason I remember that so clearly, is because all of the talk that summer was about the eruption of Mt. Saint Helens. I'm not sure of the month of the sighting, but I know it was later in the summer, after the eruption. My father, cousin and I were wading Deer Creek fishing for smallmouth bass. We had waded up the creek approximately one mile or so, and we were heading back down the creek to the car. I had stepped out of the creek, for a few minutes, and my father and cousing were a little ways ahead of me. I stepped back into the creek, and headed down the creek towards them. We were keeping a pretty steady pace, with my father in front, my cousin second and myself in the rear. I remember my cousin asking me what the hell I had just stepped in because of a horrid smell that suddenly filled his nostrils. I laughed and said that I had stepped in some mud along the creek bank. \"Mud doesn't smell like that\" he replied, then I smelled what he was talking about and he was right. This smell was indescribable. The closest way I could hope to describe it would be to say that it smelled like a mixture of something that had been decaying in the sun covered in rotten eggs. It was after our brief conversation about the smell that I noticed my dad had stopped walking and was not fishing, but looking ahead concentrating on something along the left bank. \"What the hell is that?\" he asked, more to my cousin than to me. My cousin looked for a moment and replied, \"A dead snag\" meaning an old dead tree. I looked up the bank trying to see what my father was looking at. Just then I saw it. I too thought it was a tree, but as I looked at it closer I could see hair moving in the slight breeze along it's side and head. It was a reddish/brown color and not extremely long, but long enough that I could see it moving. The creature was standing amid some brush that was growing along the creek, and was visible from just above the waist to the top of it's head. It was very tall, my guess would be about 8 feet high or so. I was 12 at the time, and it was definetely the strangest thing I had ever seen. My father suddenly tensed up and in a very desperate voice, said something I won't repeat here, followed by \"That's bigfoot!\" Just then, whatever was standing on that bank turned it's head, and looked straight down the creek at us. We scrambled up the right hand bank as fast as we could and started out across the field to the car. To this day, my cousin still says he saw something but doesn't know what he saw. I didn't know what it was either, but to me it just looked like a very hairy, slightly stooped man, especially when it looked towards us.",

It seems the forman's son and the son's girlfriend were riding horses on Sunday, the day following our sighting, right along the same area of our encounter. when the horses suddenly spooked and threw the riders off and bolted out across a field. The creek that we were fishing in, is the tailwater to that lake. I don't remember any more details about it other than that, except to say that the foreman's son was very puzzled by a strange smell and the fact that the horses threw them off, when they had riden horses there several times before without incident.",
