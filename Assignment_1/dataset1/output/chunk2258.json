The witness attempted to get a light(100,000 candlepower)  on the source of the sound, but was unable to.The witness returned to the area 2 weeks later during the day to look for tracks, but found none. The witness was afraidthe entire time he was in the area, and left quickly. The vocalization soundsed as if what ever made it was upset or worried.",
