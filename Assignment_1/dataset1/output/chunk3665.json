Gray hair over entire body. muscular very thick neck. Was standing very erect, turning head side to side as if trying to smell for something. Looked directly at me and I ducked down. When I looked again nothing was there. I heard a scream the previous day but attributed that to a bobcat. A friend of mine was in a deer stand approx. 1 and 1/4 mile away as the crow flies down from the ravine in the direction in which I thought it went. He told me that I wouldn't believe what ran by his deer stand. He described to me the same thing I saw. He was very upset.",
