            "Follow-Up Report": "In August of 2007 the witness was playing outside with his two kids just before sunset. He was making his way to the barn when he heard a howl coming from the south 100 yards away. He was struck by the volume and intensity of the howl. It was the first of 5 or 6 howls, the first howl being the closest and the rest of the howls were made as it moved along a wooded area. It made the howls as it moved over a mile and covered the distance in two minutes.The witness remarked that a person couldn\u0092t cover that terrain and make it through the foliage that fast. The 2nd howl was done while the subject was moving down a hill into an area 70 feet lower. The witness could tell that when the howls were made that whatever was doing it was facing him.The witness was 46 year old at the time and has been a bow hunter for most of the 40 years. He has also hunted in Alaska and Idaho. He\u0092s lived in the area all his life and is familiar with all the wild life in the area. He\u0092s well versed in coyote behavior in the area and has a coyote den on his property.The howl he heard isn\u0092t anything he\u0092s ever heard in all of his years of being in the outdoors. He listened to a sound file on the BFRO website from Isabella Co. Michigan (Report #32981 \u0096 Sound Link - 1/22/12) and told me \u0093that\u0092s what the howl sounded like\u0094.As he was playing the sound file on his computer his wife overheard it and said that\u0092s what she heard in the summer of 2010 when she was outside having a cigarette on the porch.He\u0092s had several curious events around his property, and a neighbor to the southeast of him heard a howl from the woods in between the properties within the past year. He heard a howl that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. The neighbor, in his early 40s, has an extensive hunting experience. Supposedly there have been more howls heard from this neighbor and his family from this area.The black walnut trees near his house have their walnuts but the trees away from his house hardly have any nuts. He said the squirrels will eat the nuts, but not enough, and that there\u0092s hardly any nuts on the trees and on the ground. He noticed this when he considered selling the black walnuts and wanted to see how many walnuts he could harvest from the trees.In 2008 he was deer hunting and two trees fell over within 30 minutes of each other. The trees were a couple of hundred yards away from him and in the same direction, in a low lying area in a cedar swamp.Several years ago while deer hunting he was watching a tree line 300 yards away with binoculars, he saw something black move out from beside a maple tree and move back in the tree line. Ninety minutes later he saw it move out from the opposite side of the tree. The black object was 3 feet off the ground but there isn\u0092t any wildlife that color and that size in the area.Subsequently, he has found out there\u0092s a black bear being reported by the DNR in the area. But the witness pointed out that a bear would have been denning up by that time.The stick structure the witness viewed was while he was using binoculars (10x50), from 200 \u0096 300 yards away. It was strange because it was in the back of the park where kids wouldn\u0092t frequent. The structure was 4 \u0096 5 feet high. The stick structure wasn\u0092t something you\u0092d find naturally occurring he said.The deer that he wrote about in his report was strange because it was a couple of days old. He knows that because he walked past the area a few days before and it wasn\u0092t there. Even though there was some snow on the ground it was giving off a strong odor. He could see that that coyotes had been scavenging off it but it was strange because the neck was broken and the lower jaw was gone. The hide was pulled up over the back and most of the deer was gone. He mentioned coyotes aren\u0092t going to break the neck of a deer, and that if the deer got hit by a car it couldn\u0092t have gotten to where it finally laid with a broken neck.",

            "Observed": "I was fishing Friday from about 8 pm to a little after 9:30 pm on the Savannah river between Lake Hartwell and Lake Russel on the Georgia/SC line. I had walked up the trail by the river from the last parking area to try for some trout or maybe a walleye. It was after 9 pm and dark now. I was about ready to call it a night when I heard distinct footsteps coming towards me. I first thought it might be another fisherman, but the closest one to me was at the first parking area about a half mile away and he was fishing on one of the piers. I thought it was on the trail I had came in on but realized it was up on the side of the hill. I got closer and it stepped on a couple of limbs that cracked from its weight. I thought to myself it had to be another person but why would they be on a hillside in thick woods at night with no light? I broke the thumbsnap on my Sig 45acp just in case it was somebody up to no good. I only had my LED headlamp on and when I shined it at the sound it stopped. I would estimate it was about 25 to 30 yards from me at the time. I could see nothing, no eyes or anything. About a minute after I took the light off of it, it started walking again. I was getting a little concerned by now. I know it wasn\u0092t a deer, as I have spent my whole life in the woods and know what deer sound like when walking. I eased out onto the trail and started walking back to the truck. The footsteps parralelled me back to the parking area but never came out of the woodline. I had Surefire G2 light in the truck and shined it in the woods to see if I could find the source of the sounds. I never did see anything. Nor did I smell anything. I don\u0092t know if it could have been a BF. This area is pretty heavily used and in proximity to a major highway. All I know is the whole thing was very strange because usually a deer or other animals will spook when you put a light on them.",
