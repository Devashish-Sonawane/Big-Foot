            "Observed.1  ": "November 2012 Last month the talk of the town was a story The City Observer reported, which was a Bigfoot or a Sasquatch was allegedly seen around Lake Macy by two men.  The two men reported their sighting to the Bigfoot Researchers Field Organization (BFRO) and an investigation of the area began. BFRO Investigator, R. Monteith learned during the initial search that a homeowner and family members near Lake Macy had experienced some strange unidentifiable sounds for several nights, and then had had something terrify them by hitting the house and causing damage to the siding well over the 7 foot mark.  \u0093Although the family never saw anything that would resemble a sasquatch on their property, the fact that they have lived there for many years and have never heard those sounds before or since is worth investigating. Sasquatch have been reported many times to slap or hit homes, trailers, RV\u0092s and even cars leads me to think they may have been visited by what us Investigators call, \u0093a Local.\u0094 Even the siding damage is the right height and its shape is the size of a large palm.\u0094   Last month Monteith asked for the public\u0092s help in reporting any unusual or unidentifiable occurrences to her during her investigation.  \u0093If folks are willing to speak to me \u0096 and they do remain anonymous \u0096 I am always willing to lend them an ear and answer any questions.  I received a call from a gentleman that wasn\u0092t sure what he and his friends had heard in early August. It was a week after the original sighting and he too lives near Lake Macy. The man and his friends were in the backyard around midnight, and heard what sounded like \u0093a gorilla in the woods, huffing.\u0094 A few weeks later when the story broke, he called to tell me about it after reading the paper. Although we can\u0092t recreate that noise, it does seem thought-provoking it again, was at the same time and area as the other reported activity.\u0094 Monteith also wanted to add that although several people in town feel that the Bigfoot sighting is a certain tall, bearded resident that frequents the area, it\u0092s not. \u0093The description is clearly not of a man who wears eye-glasses and clothing.\u0094  \u0093I also received information from a woman who may have actually seen one in her back pasture. She said last July or August she was awakened around 1:00am by her horse \u0093screaming\u0094 and stomping the ground. She went outside with a flashlight and saw what she thought was the largest bear she had ever seen. It was standing upright on two legs next to the 8 foot high stable with what appeared to be its hand resting on the roof. When she flashed the light on it, it dropped down and ran off much faster than she\u0092s ever seen a bear move. The woman claimed she\u0092d never thought it could be anything other than a bear until she read the last month\u0092s paper.\u0094  \u0093Now, this is where it gets fun to be an investigator,\u0094 Re explains, \u0093I asked her a few more questions and learned a great deal. One, being that bears have been through the area before and her horse had never reacted in such a way. Also, two weeks prior her horse had made some noise one night and in the morning she\u0092d found her \u0093animal proof\u0094 barrel of feed open. It had been taken off the pallet and left upright, with the top off; it had had a twist top she described as difficult to open. What is fascinating is that it had not been spilled, chewed, or left in disarray. It had been neatly opened but some had been eaten.\u0094 Black Bears in Florida are a sub-species and the average weight being just under 250 lbs., with the largest ever recorded being 624 lbs. \u0093This woman claims the \u0093bear\u0094 she saw was far larger than that,\u0094 adds Monteith. \u0093And she now thinks she has finally solved the mystery of her vegetable garden. For years, she has tried to grow tomatoes, squash and peppers. She could always tell when certain animals got into the garden because they would leave parts of the vegetables with tooth marks. It was the bounty that was plucked and taken completely from the vine without remnants that puzzled her. She eventually gave up trying to grow them.\u0094 Monteith went out to the property to take a look a look around. \u0093I walked the area and a neighbor\u0092s property and found a track of 15 \u00bd inch prints. A left and right print, with a 38 inch stride between the two. In the last 48 hours the area had heavy rains from Tropical Storm Isaac. These prints were less than 24 hours old as they had not been washed away.\u0094 \u0093The latest phone call I received was from a woman who claims to have seen a very tall, dark head peeking around a tree two nights in a row while she weeded the lawn. When I went to the property and spoke to her I was able to find several footprints in the nearby woods.  And it was not too surprising to me that her property borders Lake Macy,\u0094 Monteith states. \u0093The most interesting story I heard about was an old one. About 40 years ago a legend began in this area because someone experienced an unusual sighting of an unknown animal,\u0094 Monteith states. \u0093Most beliefs, legends, or what we refer to as myths, begin with a truthful story. Over time or with embellishment it can change \u0096 but it usually starts with some truth.  Apparently, back in the early 70\u0092s a story was started about a resident creature referred to as the \u0093Mole Man. It was tall, bipedal, hairy, and had red eye glow. It lived in the orange grove off Ohio and Prevatt Avenue. During this time people would go into the groves with guns looking for it. I spoke with several people who lived in Lake Helen at that time and remember seeing or hearing about footprints. One man who had been a police officer at the time, was acquainted with a \u0093character\u0094 now deceased, who had claimed to have hoaxed the town. Apparently many took the Mole Man story as truth considering many were toting guns around with them.\u0094 It seems the Mole Man got his name not from digging, or living underground, but from just being in an area where there were mole hills. The dirt road into the grove was commonly referred to as, \u0093Mole Hill Road.\u0094  \u0093Although, we have a very credible person stating the entire Mole Man incident was a hoax, I want to point out that the man claiming to have hoaxed the town wasn\u0092t so credible,\u0094 Monteith says. \u0093I also find it astonishing that the orange grove where the Mole Man lived is one street or less than 800 yards from the latest sightings, the siding damage and the \u0093gorilla sounds.\u0094  I also think when a creature gets fabricated - especially back in the days before Bigfoot was well known - imagination would have made it scarier. Perhaps with claws, a tail, horns, and fangs.  Not one person I spoke to added that to the description. This Mole Man is described as a Bigfoot would look, and it had red eye glow. Red eye glow has been reported many times, and it is different from eye shine which is what happens when a light is shined on the eye.\u0094 And to add to the story and that particular orange grove is that in 1989 two girls saw what they thought was a very tall black naked man running through the grove one night. It ran through the beam of their headlights. They assumed he was naked because they didn\u0092t see any clothes. LAKE HELEN AND THE \u0093Halibut Effect\u0094 The \u0093Halibut Effect\u0094 is a phenomenon that has been documented in nature. It is a term coined by bigfoot researcher and Animal Planet\u0092s Finding Bigfoot host, Cliff Barakman, to describe how large halibut can be found in areas where they were once caught frequently, but were thought to have been eradicated from over-fishing. It seems marine habitats with all the right factors and ingredients which allowed the halibut to grow large decades ago, would eventually attract more halibut and allow them to grow very large again. It\u0092s also a good analogy for bigfoot sighting locations. If the natural character of an area has not changed much since the last sightings, or the area is more forested, there\u0092s a good chance that bigfoots will still use the area from time to time. \u0093Your quaint little town, which by the way has a great surrounding habitat for bigfoots, may be experiencing this very phenomenon,\u0094 Monteith adds. \u0093If you\u0092re still confused about just what to believe, the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization website (BFRO.net) lists several undisputed facts about bigfoot, as well as thousands of credible reports and stories,\u0094 Monteith adds. Here are just a few of the facts the BFRO lists:                            It's a fact that for more than 400 years people have reported seeing large, hair-covered, man-like animals in the wilderness areas of North America. It is a fact that sightings of these animals continue today. Real or not, these reports are often made by people of unimpeachable character.  It is a fact that, for over seventy years, people have been finding, photographing, and casting sets of very large human-shaped tracks. Most are discovered by chance in remote areas. These tracks continue to be found to this day. It is a fact that the cultural histories of many Native American and First Nation peoples include stories and beliefs about non-human \"peoples\" of the wild. Many of these descriptions bear a striking resemblance to the hairy man-like creatures reported today.  These are some of the facts. There is, however, much disagreement as to what these facts mean.  To many, these facts, taken together, suggest the presence of an animal, probably a primate, which exists today in very low population densities. If true, this species, having likely evolved alongside humans, became astonishingly adept at avoiding human contact through a process of natural selection. To others, these same facts point to a cultural phenomenon kept alive today through a combination of the misidentification of known animals, wishful thinking, and the deliberate fabrication of evidence. The BFRO, and its members, take the former view. The BFRO will continue with its investigation of the Lake Helen/Casadaga area. If you should see, hear or experience anything unusual, which you may think might be bigfoot related, you can contact R. Monteith, at the BFRO at contactus@bfro.net. All reports and information remain confidential.    ",

            "Observed.1  ": "Wildlife biologists, however, seem to agree that such creatures live only in myth. \u0093No such thing exists,\u0094 said retired Department of Natural Resources wildlife biologist Jim Schneeweis of Grand Rapids. \u0093If there were all these Bigfeet running around, sooner or later somebody would have found a dead one. The DNR has had cameras (in remote locations) for years. How come nobody\u0092s ever got one on film?\u0094 While wildlife biologists say that Bigfoot stories are not founded in scientific evidence, that does not seem to stop those who do believe such creatures exist. A simple Google search will reveal hundreds of reported sightings around the nation and entire Web sites devoted to the tracking of the creatures. Schneeweis said that he was not aware of any sightings or other evidence reports of the existence of Sasquatch creatures out of the Grand Rapids office, but did say that he was aware of sighting reports in the Northome area in the past. Olson, who carefully made plaster reproductions of the giant human-looking prints this week to preserve them, said that there have been numerous sightings in northern Minnesota - including some on Winnie Dam Lake Road. The self-described enthusiast, said that he has heard reports of increased Bigfoot activity in the area for the past two years. He is not the only one who is interested. Local resident Wayne Nelson called in the report of possible Bigfoot evidence to the newspaper on Monday, saying that, on his way to go fishing, he saw people taking pictures of the ground between the road and the woods. After pulling over and speaking with the people there, Nelson realized what they were looking at: 17 inch long tracks, about three-quarters of an inch deep into the dirt.  Looking like human footprints, but larger and with toes of all the same size, there was speculation that the tracks were not human because human tracks normally only reach a depth of about one-quarter inch, according to Nelson. The prints, no matter what the source, have generated curiosity and despite the disbelief of the scientific community, it has done little to sway those who are certain Sasquatch creatures exist. \u0093I know exactly what made it (the footprints) - Bigfoot,\u0094 Olson told the newspaper. Herald-Review Editor Beth Bily and Staff Writer Marie Nitke contributed to this report.",
