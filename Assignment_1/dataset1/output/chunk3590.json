            "Follow-Up Report": "After interviewing the witness by phone, the following details may be added to his report:\u0095\tClear skies and calm winds existed at time of sighting\u0095\tGiven the topography and the subjects\u0092 sudden appearance, witness felt that their initial approach could have possibly been executed in a quadrupedal fashion.\u0095\tSubjects moved \u0093leisurely but quickly.\u0094\u0095\tSince witness was hunting with a muzzleloader, and restricted to a relatively close shot, he was not using binoculars or a scope.\u0095\tNo other hunters were seen in the immediate area.\u0095\tThere were no unusual events noted after the sighting except for the trailer tack room door being unlatched.The witness hunted at the same location again this year. He noticed that the tree used in the barricade had been removed from the stream. Apparently the Forest Service had collected and burned debris in the area. What follows is a note describing an unusual find at the sighting location:Todd:I hunted the same area this year that I did last year where I had my sighting. I revisited the stick structure and took a video of it with my iPhone. I also went back to where I actually saw the bigfoots and found a dead deer with lower legs missing. Of note that there was no gut contents on the ground or drag marks where the deer had been dragged. Always at the sight of a kill we will find at least intestine contents on the ground ( pellets, etc.)  None of this was at the sight. Also there was no evidence of a bullet or arrow wound on the body. I Suspect that the neck was broken for the kill. It really looks to me like the deer was killed at a different location and then carried to the sight. Why was it abandoned? Beats me - could I have spooked off the bigfoots and they dropped it? The ground is gravelly and hard so I could not find any foot prints. Also of note I could not see any knife marks on the removed leg sections. Your thoughts are much appreciated.",
