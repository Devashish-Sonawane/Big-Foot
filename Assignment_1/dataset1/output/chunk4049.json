            "Observed.1  ": "Spears ordered his deputy to check out the incident but he found nothing.   The witness claimed, it was a \u0093large figure, dark in color, black-brown in color, with no clothes and it looked like it was just fur,\u0094 Spears said. The person added,  \u0093There\u0092s no way it could have been a wolf,\u0094 Spears said. The report was one of 22 suspicious activity reports in the area including some peacock problems, he said. The department only confirmed two sightings of peacocks in Christiana. Vernon County is in southwestern Wisconsin in the Kickapoo Valley, which has over the decades been known for being a haven of old hippies, off-the-grid folks and organic fruit and vegetable growers, especially wild mushrooms. I\u0092ve paddled canoes on the Kickapoo River, which is known for the beautiful valley scenery and the river, called by some \u0093the crookedest river in the country.\u0094 And beyond the scenery there always seems to be something that\u0092s a little off about that valley, besides the hempish type plants that have been known to grow along the river. The river itself is considered a paddling destination in the state, mainly because it\u0092s undammed for its 130-mile length. Several small towns along the way have camping areas for paddlers to pull off and pitch their tents. To get some semblance of solitude it pays to camp along the river. But that can lead to unintended results of the kind to report to the sheriff. After snuffing out the stove one night after dinner, I took a walk through some fields to enjoy the stars and work off some calories. A farmhouse and barns were nearby but not exceedingly close, until the pigs started snorting. The animals seemed to have their boundary line to start fussing. A few steps either way would have the snorting stopping and starting. It was a fun test of the porkers\u0092 ability until I heard another human. Brief but distant shouts to the pigs came from that guy. And then the shooting started. Good thing it was dark. The farmer apparently was trigger happy to kill varmints in the fields and intermittently sprayed buckshot into the night. I hit the ground and crawled back to the river through the blackness. Despite smarting from that reality I still refused to succumb by pitching my tent in public. They were treeless flat areas cut out by the river, more for pop-ups than tents. I chose a spot on top of the bank next to a cornfield. Shortly after dusk the field lit up with lights. It was \u0093Close Encounters of the Third Kind\u0094 with pickups and spotlights. The locals were apparently taking part in that Wisconsin ritual of \u0093shining.\u0094 Shining is a year-round sport in deer country where those with spotlights get to drinking, shine and then shoot deer, albeit illegally, since everyone knows you can\u0092t hunt at night. There might be campers in the woods after all. But I was in a cornfield, which happens to be good fodder for feeding deer. Bullets flew through the husks in my general direction. Apparently movement of the corn meant deer and I was fair game. Sasquatch could have a nice place to stay in the valley, though. A spillway and intake tower still stand from a 1970s failed dam project near La Farge, which happens to be in the Town of Stark. We\u0092re not sure of any other ethereal connections in the Sasquatch case, but the sighting was on \u0093Jug Creek Road,\u0094 the sheriff said. But Wisconsin? Bigfoot sightings are usually associated with the Pacific Northwest region of North America. But this sighting is not the first in the diary state. Check out the video. UPDATE: Bigfoot moving East JACKSOWN TOWNSHIP, Pa. Not soon after the Wisconsin incident, comes another strange Bigfoot case. Police responded to a call in late October to a motor home in Dauphin County. A Pennsylvania State police trooper checked out the broken tail lights from a vehicle along the 400 block of Division Street in Lykens Boro on Oct. 18 around noon. A witness told the trooper his lights and windows of his 1973 Dodge Winnebago had been smashed. He blamed Bigfoot for the damage. A police report confirms the report but not necessarily that it was indeed Bigfoot. \u0093Prior to these incidents, the victim related that he saw a Bigfoot in the area of his motor home,\u0094 a state police press release said. \u0093The actor is described as very large, brown in color, and walks somewhat hunched over.\u0094 The witness said that when he turned the light on in his motor home, the Bigfoot started throwing rocks. Police said the witness described the creature as \u0093hairy.\u0094 \u0096 TWM Doug Hissom writes a weekly environmental column for Baltimore Post-Examiner.
