It was snowing and unbelievably cold. We had been in the woods a couple of hours when I got seperated from the rest of the hunting party. The next thing I remember is a very loud sound like a freight train coming threw the woods. All I got was a five-second look at what ever it was it was. It was huge in size and running on two feet full steam ahead. There was no one else around. I do believe they were in front of me by a hundred yards. I told them about it when I caught up too them and they just laughed and said it was a deer. It was no deer and I have been hunting for 26 years. I have never been so scared in my life even though I stood there with a loaded shot gun.",
