On that first event, Tony looked around and found himself standing all alone when the unusual sounds had stopped.  Tony was only 11 years old on that first event, and he was 13 years old on the second event which were under the same conditions. On both occasions, it made a kind of roaring and screaming sound which were mixed together.  He heard it three times on that first event, and he heard it two times on the second event, in which it was making a similar sound.  Both of these events occurred at about the midnight hour, during a snowstorm, at Tony's home, which is on a Navajo reservation in the northeast corner of Arizona.  Tony described the sound as the same one he had heard on the BFRO Internet sound reports, the one where the barking dog is heard in the background. ",
