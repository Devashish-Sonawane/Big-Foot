            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness by phone a couple of times and then in person.She is an administrative assistant in the health care industry and a mother of several children. I found her to be succinct and precise in describing the details of her encounter. She was expressive and thoroughly credible in every aspect of these interviews. On a clear Wednesday evening she was returning home from work, around 22:30 when she stopped at a traffic light at an intersection on the outskirts of Middleburg, traveling west. There was no other traffic. When the light changed and she turned south, her headlights panned across 2 large creatures that were located just off the road onto which she was turning (about 18 meters) and on the side of a second road that was intersecting her new direction of travel from the west. Because she was accelerating slowly from a dead stop,the sighting of these creatures lasted probably 5-6 seconds . She stated that one of the creatures stood in a half crouch or half squat, hunched over with its head facing down towards its lap. She described it as making fast jerky movements with its arms and hands, \"like it was beating a drum on its lap\". Its elbows seemed to be moving wildly to and fro as well. She stated that her first impression was that it seemed to have something alive across its lap and seemed to be trying to subdue it or kill it. The other creature was taking no action, but just standing there and observing the first. She couldn't exactly estimate their height, though they were about the same size. She did say that the one that was moving was standing right in front of a speed limit sign for west bound traffic and its head blocked the sign. I later measured the center of the sign to be right at 7'. As she went by she became very frightened at seeing this unusual sight and sped away.Her attention was primarily focused on the creature that was engaged in activity, they looked like they were about the same size except one was in a half crouch and the other was not. Her physical descriptions of the creatures were as follows:- Neither overly bulky nor skinny.-The creatures both had long gray hair (not fur) that appeared to hang in layers, straight and not matted.-2 pairs of eyes reflecting red were seen as they looked up at her car.- Facial hair that appeared swept back off the face on the sides.-Neither creature gave an impression of a visible neck nor ears.-The arms were described as longer in proportion than humans with long hanging hair from the forearms.",
