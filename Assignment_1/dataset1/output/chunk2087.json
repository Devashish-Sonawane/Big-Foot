            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone on 4/19/12 and he provided more details of this encounter and a possible sighting from the week before, in the same area.  The witness states that he goes to this location almost every weekend of the summer, beginning in June when the mountain streams open for fishing.  He states that he has never seen another person in this area.  He added to this report that as he was running back to his car, he heard loud noises in the bushes on both sides of the road, keeping pace and paralleling him.  He said the noises ceased when he was within eyesight of his car.  He said that he had left all his camping equipment when he fled and upon returning the next week, found his camp '\"messed up\" and his food stock missing.  The witness recalled that the week before he was in the same location and fishing a small lake just as the sun was setting.  He says that he looked across the lake (a distance estimated at 100 yards) and saw a brown colored bear in a tree looking directly at him.  He states that as the light was fading he shone a small flashlight and the \"bears\" eyes reflected back a bright, lime-green color.  As we talked he reflected back on the bear incident and stated that he remembered thinking at the time that the bear looked unusual and that \"if it was a bear it was among the biggest\" he had ever seen and \"would have had to weigh at least 600 pounds.\"  He concluded that he thought \"bear\" at the time but believes that isn't what he was looking at, given the shape of the head and the face.  I believe this witness may well have seen Bigfoot on the trip the week prior to this incident and did get escorted from the area on the trip described in this report.  Also, really large bears seldom climb trees and certainly not to gain a better view of an object 100 or more yards away, as they can't see any detail at that distance anyway.    The witness is very sincere in his telling of being scared out of the woods and his voice affects a lot of emotion still, when re-telling the story.  ",
