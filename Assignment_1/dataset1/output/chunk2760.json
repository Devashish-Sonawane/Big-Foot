She proceeded to go around the cabin to the north as the outhouse is in back of the cabin to the west. There is a group of three small trees that we have converted to a counter and about 6-7 feet on the other side was a Pewter or dark gray \"thing\". It was walking on two feet very rapidly and she caight a glimps out of the side of her eye. She claims it made noise and had no smell. She woke me and I found nothing. We have heard screams and wood being struck for many years and several other sighting have been made by our guests and people that live along the road.",

            "Observed": "I believe this incident occurred in the summer of 1981, when I was sixteen.  I was out of school at the time, and my best friend and I were out partaking in one of our favorite pastimes: spelunking of the amatueur sort.  Our particular goal that day was the finding of a cave called Turner's Cave, one we'd heard about from my parents who said it had been a designated government fallout shelter.  We knew of one that might qualify, as it had a large entrance and such, but it didn't seem large enough for a fallout shelter to us.  We explored it once more (we'd been in it before), and then decided to move on down the creekbed and try to find another that might be it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I will refer to the witness as G. He stated as they were resting in the pasture, they heard noises as of something moving through the trees close to where they had just crossed the fence. At first he thought it may be squirrels, but after a moment the noises sounded more like something large moving through the trees near them. G and his friend stood up and turned to try to see what was making the noise. As G was scanning the tree line, his friend grabbed his arm and exclaimed, \"Look at that!\" G stated that no more than 40 feet away, he could see a very large, hair-covered arm and leg of something standing behind a tree. He also stated he felt suddenly as if they shouldn't be there and they should leave. His friend was standing in a different position and got a much better look at the animal than G did.G's friend wanted to start running, but G said he was afraid if they ran it may chase them so he told his friend not to run. G stated he glanced back over and couldn't see it anymore. He heard no noise of its departure.Both of them were very scared at this point and quickly and quietly started walking back to the logging road and then to where they had left their bikes near a creek bed. When they arrived back to where their bikes were, G's friend said he saw what looked like a track in the sand next to the creek when they had crossed it. G never saw a track and stated they had calmed down a little, but were probably still in a state of shock. He doesn't know if it was a track or not his friend saw. G also stated as they were leaving, they both glanced back towards the trees and thought they saw something standing there watching them in the shadows of the trees. However, G also again stated he couldn't be sure as they were still both pretty nervous and just wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. He said it could have just been a shadow or tree.G described the arms and legs of this creature as, \"large and brownish-gray. The color was almost the same as the color of the tree bark and it blended in very well.\" The hair was described as more than 3\" long with darker roots and lighter towards the ends.G stated he lost touch with his friend a long time ago, but recalls his friend telling him the thing must have been around 7 feet tall and had a \"scary, human-like face.\" G stated that based on the size of the leg and arm he saw, 7 feet wouldn't surprise him.",
