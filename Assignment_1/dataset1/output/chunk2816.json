The family of two adults and their four children had been camping at the Waubonsie park, were taking a walk on the trail in June around 2:30 pm. It had been several days at least two since the last rain, when they noticed some foot prints appearing on the trail. The foot prints were 17-18 inches seven to eight inches wide with a stride of about five to six foot, in a straight line heel to toe. They continued their hike around the park til they ended up back at their primitive camp site. The children\u0092s age ranges from eight up to fifteen years old at the time. The Christian family enjoys being outdoors when possible to help teach their children about nature. ",

            "Observed": "My son, his best friend, and myself were driving on a short logging road that crests over a hill and dead ends at the bottom. We had just crested the hill when we saw a large, black hairy creature start running at the bottom of the clear cut towards the timber line. The creature was approximately six to seven feet tall and running on two legs. We were approximately 200 yards from it when it started running. It ran a distance of about 100 yards to the timber line in only about 4 seconds, across uneven terrain. The time was about 8:30pm.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I happened to be scouting this remote location with the witness, his son, and the other man in the Willamette National Forest when they had the encounter. They had left in their vehicle on a provisions run earlier that day. When they returned to camp that evening (approx 9PM) they all three were excited, visibly shaken up, and relating their sighting of a large man-like creature with shaggy, but seemingly well-groomed black hair covering its body.Their story prompted all four of us to head back to the location on this obscure logging road and attempt to gather evidence.They described the speed and agility of the animal as we drove for some 20 minutes to the site. One of the men remarked that during this brief, 4 or 5 second period when the creature was not in cover, it appeared that it ran with such skill that its feet never touched the ground - only stumps and logs in the clear cut.As we arrived at the location of the sighting, I proceeded out ahead of them to the approximate place where the creature went into the woods. The area was dead silent, no animal sounds - including insects, were present.While I investigated the woods edge, I heard the men speaking in excited tones and made my way back to where they were standing by their vehicle. They were remarking that they had seen a large, upright heat signature \"with arms\" behind a tree apparently \"peeking.\" The witness handed me the imager and I saw what appeared to be a heat signature very low to the ground, close to a large stump. While the stump had its own heat signature, this other form appeared to be brighter and thus detected as a warmer temperature than the stump. After handing the imager back to the witness, this brighter signature had disappeared.   We left the location and headed back to camp. The next day, we visited the site again, and using myself for a scale comparison, the witness estimated the height between 6 and 7 feet.This location has a history of sightings, most notably encounter Report 36370.These hunters have spent most of their life in the woods. Their experiences, including this encounter, has changed their entire outlook on hunting, and being in the outdoors in general.Based on the interviews with the witness and my own personal experience with the witnesses in the area, I believe there is a very high likelihood that this account was factual, and that what they saw running across the clearcut was a Bigfoot.
