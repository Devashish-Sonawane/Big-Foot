            "Observed": "My wife and I were driving late in the night trying to reach the Coldwater Creek Campground near Yacolt. By the time we got there the campground was full. We kept driving and stopped at the first logging road that had a suitably flat spot for camping (we sleep in the back of our SUV). It was a short dead end logging road in a recovering clear-cut. We set up camp and went to sleep.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witnesses telephonically on 18 November 2018.  I mostly spoke with C----, the wife of the gentleman who filed the report.  One note of correction:  This event took place near Cold Creek Campground, not Coldwater Creek Campground.  I\u0092ve synopsized C----\u0091s statements below\u0085\u0093We own a 1995 Mitsubishi Montero SUV.  We modified the back end of it by adding a sleeping platform where we sleep when we are camping.  We have a pet rabbit that travels with us.  When we got to Cold Creek Campground and found it was full we drove further up the road and pulled off into an old clear cut to spend the night.  It was about 11:00 PM when we got there. Because the air temperature was mild we left the side windows open when we went to bed.  The night was dark, with not much of a moon.\u0093Late in the night I was awakened by the sound of our rabbit scrambling around.  It was up in the front seat area of the car.  I had been sleeping on the platform in the back, on the driver\u0092s side of the vehicle.  I was on my side, with my body facing towards the outside of the car.  As I was reaching forward to check on the rabbit I suddenly felt something grab my leg, near the knee.  It felt like a hand.  It pushed down firmly on my leg, then slid down my leg about an inch.\u0093I instinctively pulled away from the touch and completely froze!  I was too scared to look out the window. I heard two soft footfalls on the driver side of the car, the side I was on.  They sounded to be moving away from me.\u0093I never went back to sleep!  About 5:30 AM I finally had to get out of the car because I needed to go to the bathroom.  That\u0092s when we found the palm print and fingerprints on the window of the car.  My husband photographed them with his cell phone.  The prints are much larger than a normal human\u0092s prints.\u0093This is the second time we\u0092ve had a nighttime visitor while camping.  The first time, we were camping in the Mt. Baker area.  It was earlier in the summer.  At that time we heard some really deep hooting sounds.  Almost like an owl, but so deep and resonate that we could feel the sounds in our chests. The sounds were close and made us so nervous that we decided to leave.  We packed up and went home because of it.  An interesting note is that both times we\u0092ve had possible bigfoot activity we had our rabbit in the car with us.\u0094I found C----\u0091s story to be compelling and it was obvious that recalling the incident was an emotional situation for her.  I could hear the fear in her voice while she was describing the event to me.  I explained to C--- that sasquatches seem to have an overpowering curiosity about humans which causes some sasquatches to approach under the cover of darkness to further investigate \u0093intruders.\u0094  I don\u0092t know if the presence of the pet rabbit enhanced the curiosity of a sasquatch, but it\u0092s an interesting thought that perhaps the rabbit was scrambling about because a giant ape was peering at it through the window?",

            "Observed": "I was deer hunting near Ellensburg, specifically GMU 328 Naneum unit last October 2020. On the 5th day of my hunt I was looking over an open area that butted up to woods and I saw a shape at the tree line that was standing upright and appeared to be a person in a Ghille suit. I thought that was odd because it is required to wear hunter orange during this hunt. I then looked down to retrieve my binoculars that were resting on my chest and I raised them up to scan the area and the person or thing was gone. I scanned the area with my eyes and binoculars and did not see it again. The person or thing I saw was approximately 300 yards away from me and there weren\u0092t very many hunters out on this day. I then moved on via foot to an area I haven\u0092t hunted yet and after about a ten minute walk I saw a track on the ground that looked like a human bare foot mark in the dirt. I took a photo of it and looked around the area for more tracks but could not locate any. The area was mostly a logged area with short field type grass and just a little bit of dirt in the area. The size of the print was only about a size 11 size foot. I then continued my hunt and left the next morning.",

He described the creature he saw as possibly 6 feet or so in height and a tan color. He said it looked like a person in a ghillie suit which was odd since it was deer season and hunter's orange required. He said he reached for his binoculars and then it was gone. He described the atmosphere as very quiet. He discovered a track which he provided a photo of. He said he wears a size 13 and he is 6ft 1 inch tall and the track he guessed would have been around a size 11 but barefoot and was very deep in the dry ground. He provided very good detail of the location and provided photos with his location marked in comparison to where the creature was located.
