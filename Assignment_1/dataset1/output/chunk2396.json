She is a very skeptical person, and is a hard person to convince of anything. She knows that I believe Bigfoot exists, because I have talked to her about Bigfoot before. She is just so skeptical about it, that I know she would think I was nuts if I ever told her my story. But after having visited your web site many times in the past, and seeing the new documentary on the discovery channel \"Sasquatch legend meets science\". I now feel like I would like to tell my story.",

He repeated the same story as in his written report (submitted almost a year previous) with good consistency of detail.  V. K. stressed that the loudness of the vocalization was the most striking part of his experience.  I asked him whether he had compared the sound he heard to those recorded on our website or others.  He said it was unlike the high-pitched vocalizations purported to be bigfoot.  The sound he heard was low and would vary -- sometimes gargling, sometimes kind of moaning.  He said he first thought it was a moose but ruled that out after the trees started shaking and the rocks came down.  V. K. is a drafter/designer for a large public company.  He was soft-spoken and struck me as very straightforward and honest.  He said it had taken him a long time to tell anyone about his experience.",

Numerous times it would turn on so after a while i started sneaking uphill to see what was triggering it. Being in the forest there I got to see all kinds of animals (elk,deer,fox,coyotes,etc.) without them seeing or smelling me because of the way the hill was I could peer over the crest unnoticed. One night the light went on, I was like cool lets see what animal is there this time. When i got to the top of the hill and peered over there was a giant human like silouette standing about 50 feet from me 20 feet from the house it howled/screamed/growled like nothing i ever heard before i turned and ran as fast as i could. I was terrified! What convinced me it was bigfoot was the size shape and sound later that week on tv an Oregon audio recording of supposed bigfoot was the sound i heard exactly. Im 100% convinced it was bigfoot.The following day i did look for prints but it was june and bone dry during fire season so i found nothing.",

The following details may be added to the above report:\u0095\tThe back porch of the main house faces the forest and there was a large garbage can of dog food on the back porch. There was also a game trail in the forest behind the house.  The witness\u0092 trailer was in front of the house. The property is \u00bd acre with the closest neighbor approx. 1/8 mile away. The witness regularly saw animals passing through and triggering the motion sensor light.  There were elk and other animals almost every night. He lived there for about one year, but never saw another animal like this.\u0095\tWitness described the biped as upright, giant, and human shaped.  When the witness crested the hill, the animal was on the side of the house and he saw its silhouette from the motion sensor light off the back porch.  He believes the animal either saw him or smelled him, and let out a growl/howl type vocalization. He felt the vocalization was directed at him. No details of the animal could be seen due to the lighting situation and limited moonlight. During the vocalization, the witness saw the animal pivot toward the forest.  He also turned and ran back to his trailer.\u0095\tThe next morning he could not find a clear footprint due to the dry ground conditions; however he did find the foot pivot or scrape mark where the animal turned.  \u0095\tNo height comparison could be made due to distance, brevity of sighting, and lighting conditions, but the witness described the animal as bigger than a human.\u0095\tHe compared the vocalization to one he had heard on an Oregon bigfoot TV show.
