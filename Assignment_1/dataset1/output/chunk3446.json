We finally went in for the night and decided to investigate on Saturday. While out on Saturday, we walked into the heavily wooded area following a power line. The whole time we were out, we felt as if we were being followed. Closer to the creek, we began to see a large, biped figure moving toward the creek. We got scared and headed back toward the road. On the way, we noticed a large footprint in the fresh mud. Later in the month, we found unusual hair on a barbed wire fence. Our zoology teacher ran tests, but couldn't determine the origin. In the fall of every year now, we go out looking and are still finding unusual things.",

Phil and his friends went out to investigate the sounds they were hearing down by the river. That is when they saw a track going up the bank. Witness was asked to relate specifics on the footprint. Phil stated that he could make out three toes, but thought there were more. It was apparent that whatever left the track slipped on the river embankment. It was right after the discovery of this track when the witnesses saw this thing that was walking on two legs. The unusual hair was found about 5 - 5 1/2 feet up on a barbed wire fence. The witness said that he never did tell his teacher what he thought the hair was.. Witnesses described the sounds as a women screaming , but higher pitched and at great lengths with an abrupt cutoff. This would go on for some time and then stop only to start up again. Phil stated that there were unusual smells in the area when the sightings occurred. He described the odors as smelling like \"strong, stagnent feces.\" Investigated by Steve Jackson ",
