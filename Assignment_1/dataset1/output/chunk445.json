            "Follow-Up Report": "I have discussed on numerous occasions the report filed by (J). Each time he has been consistent with his recounting of events. During one of our discussions I was able to find the Elk Meadow parking lot via Google earth. (J) was able to walk me through the orientation of his truck as he was listening to the chatter on the hillside. Then he talked me through the sequence of events as he moved to the second location where he saw it vault the retaining wall.During my initial call (J) noted that it had been raining and was between showers. The location was absolutely quiet as he and his fiance sat in the car with the windows rolled down. It wasn't long before they heard some sounds above them. I asked (J) if he could  hear a response to the chatter from the hillside. I was wondering if there could have been a reason for the chatter. He said no just the noises that were up on the hill above them. I asked (J) if he could describe the chatter sounds. First he commented that they reminded him of Chimpanzee.Then He made his rendition of what he heard. The sounds he produced were eerily similar to some of the vocalizations - aka as Samurai Chatter, I heard in the recordings by Sierra Sounds. Sounds that were like words but not of any recognizable dialect. At some point the vocalizations changed to rock clacking.I did find it interesting that things changed after he urinated. It was then that whatever it was that was up on the hillside decided to make its way down to their location. (J) gives a good visual aid when he said the foot falls sounded like flippers on pavement as it made its way across the parking lot. It was at this time (J) decided to move his truck. By using Google earth measurements it appears that he moved his truck about 100 yards or three hundred feet from his original location. By doing so it now gave him the ability to have his headlights on the creature. After getting the path of the creature determined from (J's) description it appears the path it traversed across the parking lot was approximately 140 feet. The parking lot has a burm in the middle with an approximate five foot elevation change from upper to lower parking lot. As he moved his car he caught a glimpse of the creature as it neared the edge of the parking lot and vaulted the retaining wall. He had his low beam and fog lights on which allowed him a good visual. He said that it turned its body to face him briefly after it went over the edge and allowed him to make some observations of its face. (J) could see skin, light in color with bushy hair or fur framing the chin and face. The face seemed ape-like with a heavy brow ridge. No appearance of a neck but a prominent jawline. The jaw was just about even with the visible collar bone or shoulders. The nose was broad and bulbous. (J) was also able to get an indication of the left ear. He said the color was brown and grayish tones, but most likely the gray was the reflection or sheen of the car headlights. He was also able to see a cream or lighter color patch on its shoulders. He estimates the creature's height between 7' 6\" to 8\" tall. It was at least 4' wide at the shoulders and narrowing at the waist(J) mentions that he looked at the foot impressions on the hill side. He was able to make a quick judgment of length by analyzing his stride. He has a thirty two inch stride and determined these were at least half again as long. That would make them approximately 48\" long. Using his 12\" boot for scale he estimates the foot prints were over 17\" long and at least 5\" in width.I believe (J) had a good visual of a bipedal creature that could not be mistaken for a bear or another human being. Included below are a Google earth map of the encounter showing the location of the creature when it was up on the hillside, its path down the hill across the parking lot and over the edge into the valley below. It shows the original location of (J's) truck and his second location as he watch the creature vault the fence. The second picture is a collaboration of efforts using (J's) description of what he saw. Using Paint software, I drew the picture and asked (J) to correct anything he saw wrong. (J) advised me that if you were to have captured the creature on film, this would have been one of the snap shots. ",
