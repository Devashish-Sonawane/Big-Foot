            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness was approximately 17 years-old at the time of her sighting and is now 21. She seemed intelligent and sincere during our conversation on Dec 19th.Witness was delivering newspapers in her vehicle at around 12 midnight. She saw a huge, black creature  walk on all-fours out onto the road. The creature stopped for about 1-2 seconds in the middle and stared at her. She described the animal as having black, medium length hair. The eyes were shining yellow in her headlights. She could only describe the face as ape-like and hairless. She described the body type as \"large as an adult cow but in a human form\". It then walked quickly into the bush and was not seen again. The witness quickly drove away. The witness has also heard strange screams and what sounds like hammering in the woods behind her father's house over the years that she lived with him in Enumclaw. She has also heard what she describes as \"someone walking on the gravel driveway late at night\". Her father always told her that it was just the usual wildlife and that everything was alright. The road crossing incident was within 20 miles of her father's house.The road crossing incident occurred very near Flaming Geyser State Park and Black Diamond State Park. The terrain is very well suited for a large amount of wild animals and plenty of food and shelter. It is my opinion that based on the description given by the witness and  the location of the incident, that she did see a Bigfoot creature and not a bear, cow, or a human in a costume.",
