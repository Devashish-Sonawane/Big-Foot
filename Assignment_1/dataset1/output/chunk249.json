            "Also Noticed": "Two days before we had hiked over to the Rubicon River canyon and fished the river below Rubicon Lake. This is a large glacier carved granite canyon. After fishing for a while we decide to hike out of the canyon and up to the Pacific Crest Trail to see if we could see Lake Tahoe. Its about a two mile hike and I am sure not many people have ever done this before. This area is a very remote part of the wilderness and we have never seen anyone else in there. As we hiked out of the canyon we started to see very large dry turds (Scat). Both my son and I have seen large piles of bear crap before but these were long and bigger in diameter than a pork and bean can.  We both commented that these were the biggest turds we had ever seen and were joking that if it was a bear it must be a giant one. I broke up several of the turds but there was really no evidence of berries, fir or bone that you usually see in scat. They were just big solid dry turds. Again we didn't have big foot on our minds so we just thought that it was a giant bear turd. Now I believe that they might have been from a Bigfoot. My son and I have considered purchasing one of those remote motion type wildlife cameras and going back in there and seeing what we could capture on film. We are planning another trip into desolation at the end of June and would be glad to take a BFRO investigator with us. We are now both convienced that Bigfoot exists and plan to explore some very remote areas of Placer and ElDorado counties to see what we can see and or find.",
