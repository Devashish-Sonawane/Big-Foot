            "Follow-Up Report": "Secondary Followup by Bruce BeekmanI made contact with the witness in the Portage County report, D. T. and visited him and the areas where the incidents took place. I viewed the area along the roadway where the sighting in his report happened. He also took me to a couple other areas with reports as follows: He was stayng at a friends house very close by one night about a year or so prior to the road sighting. They had an in ground pool at the time and had gravel right around the pool area. While they were inside fooling around talking on the phone, he heard footsteps on the gravel at aprox 10-11 pm. They ran upstairs and turned all the lights off and heard more steps leaving the gravel.They looked outside and his freind could see a small sapling moving a little against the dark sky.They got a shotgun and took the screen out of the window and listened for approx 1/2 hr but didnt hear any more. His friend decide to let go with a shotgun blast and all hell broke loose. They heard the creature take off into the woods and in doin so broke off a 3\" sapling about 4-5' above the ground. A short time later the parents arrived home and they recited the story to them. They were told not to repeat the story to anyone. They found 1 indentation in wet leaves the next day which was estimated about the size of a cinder block. Another encounter was during a campout in the woods not too far from the above incident in a small clearing in dense forrest. This also took place within a year or so of the other incidents (mid 80s). The witness and two friends were camping in the clearing and were in the tent goofing off getting ready to go to sleep when they heard steps and snapping sticks approx 25 yards out. It circled the tent staying about the same distance away. When it got part way around they coud smell a very foul odor like something rotten. It circled the tent twice in about 10 minutes and the moved away. Screams and howls have been heard by several people starting about when they moved in, in 1974. Soon after this, they had been playing cards and drinking beer one night and stepped out on the porch for some relief when they heard a scream right at the edge of the woods. They grabbed a spotlight but saw nothing. Other similar screams were heard across the road from these houses on other ocasions. There have been no recent incidents by this witness because he doesnt get out to the area much anymore He does not claim to know exactly what creatures caused these incidents but seems very sincere and honest with regards to what he experienced. Respectfully submitted, Bruce Beekman ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This location of this incident is roughly 5 miles south of the midnight encounter behind the Warehouse 24 gym on the outskirts of Ashland. That incident was also documented in the Richland Source web site by reporter Carl Hunnell. Click here for BFRO report 69065.I've spoken with this witness a few times prior to posting this report. He is very credible and works in law enforcement for the state of Ohio. Because he works in law enforcement he is barred from speaking to the media as an identified law enforcement officer. That's a common thing for most of the country. Thankfully he agreed to meet with a prominent local jouranlist who was willing to document the incident for a local news story but without revealing the witness's name, though the journalist was allowed to verify that he was a law enforcement officer as part of his due diligence. The witness did not get a Class A view of the figure walking across the field but he was able to observe it for a while. The photos below show the grassy field and demonstrate why there were no clear footprints afterward. As stated in the report, the witness investigated the incident himself not long afterward by asking his adult son to stand and walk where the figure had walked. See his comments about that in his report. For the first time we have a witness who is willing to take questions from people about the incident and/or the photos shown below. The link connects to the BFRO Facebook Group page and specifically the posting about this sighting report. The witness will reply to the comments about the posting with the name \"Ashland Witness\".Below that Facebook link is a link to the local newspaper article about the incident. The article was written by Carl Hunnell for the RichlandSource web site after Carl met with the witness at the property where the incident occurred.BFRO Facebook Group Page for discussion and questions about this incident.
