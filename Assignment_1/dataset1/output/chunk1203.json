We spoke at length by phone about the vocalizations, scent and close proximity of the shelter movement. He was believable and very adamant in his description of the incident. The area has agricultural fields, streams, a farm pond and a river within 2 miles. The area is within a couple miles of the Cherokee National Forrest. The teenagers first noticed the foul smell a couple minutes before the vocalizations and shaking of the shelter. The dogs were acting strange. The scream was described as a moan scream that blasted from just behind the shelter at an incredibly loud frequency that lasted four to five seconds. The last teen to get out of the woods carrying his dog, described a feeling of being paralyzed with fear at the campsite. ",

It was getting to be later in the afternoon, about 3pm or so, and we decided to find a place to pitch a tent. By this time we were about 80- 90 feet above the house and in the woods at this old single room trailer that is left up there, locked. In the front there is a fire pit and so that's were we decided to pitch the tent. My two friends, one a guy about 20 years old, the other a girl about 17 years old decide to go and grab some wood from, just near by. Not but a minute after rounding the trailer, I hear both scream and run back around the trailer with shear panic on thier faces. It freaked me out just by looking at them. They both swore up and down they saw a very large, hairy, upright \"thing\", move very quickly out from behind a tree into thicker brush near by. I thought g at first and figured it was my stepdad checking up on us. We decided to stay anyways and within a couple of hours it was pouring rain with thunder and lighting. I did end up asking my step dad if he came out and he denies any involvment.",
