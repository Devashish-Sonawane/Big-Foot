            "Observed": "It was opening day of modern gun deer season in Logan County Kentucky, Nov. 14, 2015.  My husband  took me to my deer stand at the edge of the hay field.  There was no moon, and I couldn't see much of anything in front of me. I waited until he left in the old Jeep and continued to wait for approximately 10-15 min before I turned on the red bill light on my cap to load my gun.  I loaded three shells into my 243 then turned off my bill light. Within a minute I hear a rustle on the ground to my left and slowly turned my head in the direction of the sound.  I saw two red lights, like eyes approximately 30ft away and I judged the red lights to be 8-10 feet off the ground.  I thought for a second that I was seeing spots before my eyes from my red bill light.  I rubbed my eyes and blinked a couple of times, thinking I needed to clear my eyes.  The lights were steady for a few seconds then blinked twice, like I had done.  I was wondering what was going on, thinking another hunter had walked up to my stand, then I heard loud movement in the leaves as if it was moving up to the old road approximately 50 yds away. I could not make out a shape but as it neared what I considered close to the  old road, it stopped and started a low whoo sound that increased to a very loud whoop.  I was scared then, I have hunted for many years and I have never heard an animal make that sound. I clicked the safety off my gun but by that time I could hear it making it's way along the old road ridge heading toward our cattle barn.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Talked to Jean via phone and she seems to be a very sincere and honest individual, that was not sure what was going on that morning. Her husband left her at the tree stand then drove off to his father on down. She then climbed up to the tree stand and switched on her red light  to load her rifle. Then after turning off the light she head a rustle in the leaves 30 ' away and noticed two red lights about 8 to 10 off the ground. She then blinked twice and the red eyes then blinked twice. This was a shock to her thus taking off the rifles safety after hearing a low whoop that became a very loud whoop. It then started to walk down an old road away from her, towards her husbands stand.That month while mending a fence rocks were thrown at her until she threw rocks back and said I know your there.Another time in November she saw a large bi-pedal figure walk over a ridge in the pasture field some distance away. The color difference from their cows is what attracted her to it.This area is about three miles from where i had my encounter on the same creek, but mine was in August of 2014.Her husband noticed red eye glow that blinked twice while at his tree stand some distance away. She said the animal would have had time to get to her husbands stand by going over the ridge, but wasn`t sure it was the same one.",

Both brothers report that they viewed the animal and could not discern any color variations that would be expected if someone were wearing a coat.   Brother B viewed the animal through the binoculars first and added the following information.  He thought the animal weighed between three to four hundred pounds.  The animal stood between seven to eight feet in height.  He describes the legs as long and the arms hung down to the knees.  The witness offered some detail describing the throwing motion when the animal threw the rock into the lake.  He describes it as being a straight-arm motion.  Brother A viewed the animal from a prone position, as he was nervous when viewing the animal. He states that the animal legs were \u0093thick\u0094.  He also adds that the animal closed the gap between them very quickly with very few strides, and the animal remained bipedal at all times.  The area that borders the lake in this region has sand dunes adjacent to the lake, followed by heavy forest.  The area is rich with food sources, including fish, moose, blueberries and huckleberries.   ",
