Upon a certain area on top side of mountain I spotted something out of my left side of sight as I stopped and looked I saw a blackish figure walk behind a large slash pile. I only saw it for 2 seconds as it walked and looked at me until it disappeared behind slash pile and into woods. I almost went out to look for tracks, but honestly I was afraid. I've been in the woods for years, avid hunter and open minded, but I KNOW what I saw was a BIGFOOT.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was driving his pickup on a mountain road when he noticed his dog (riding \u0093shotgun\u0094 in the passenger seat) alert and looking to the left.  The witness then looked to the left and saw a Bigfoot walk behind a slash pile.  The pile was about 75 yards away, near the tree line.The witness felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up as he stopped to look.  He waited about five minutes, thinking the Bigfoot might walk out from behind the other side of the slash pile, but it didn\u0092t.  When the witness drove on up the road, which curves to the left, he could see that the Bigfoot was not behind the slash pile, leading him to believe it had turned and walked into the woods.Slash piles are piles of branches left over from logging operations and are typically eight to ten feet high.  Using that as a reference, the witness described the Bigfoot as being \u0093at least eight feet tall.\u0094  It had a steady stride  with a natural arm swing and was \u0093in no hurry\u0094 as it turned to look at the witness and walk behind the slash pile.  The witness could see that it had no hair on its face as it looked right at him.The witness is retired and spends a lot of time in the woods.  He reported knowing the local wildlife well and is confident in his Bigfoot sighting.  He stated that he would normally be comfortable getting out to look for tracks, but could not on that particular day.When we spoke he offered to take me up to the location, which he has not returned to since his sighting.  So we planned to do that when the roads are open later in the spring.  On May 16, I met the witness to go to the sighting location.  While waiting to meet, I walked up a side road and found some possible sasquatch sign, they were old 15\" tracks.  Near a creek in another location, I saw more old sign the same size.",
