            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed KB, who I met at the 2014 Iowa BFRO Expedition and  worked with closely. He is a very experienced outdoorsman who spent a considerable amount of time hiking the most challenging terrain where the expedition was held in search of physical evidence.At Interstate State Park he used the knowledge he picked up at the Iowa Expedition regarding how to choose a location for a likely encounter which is why he chose the park and south camp site #68.   As KB reported he conducted a night operation consisting of three adults and one child on a trail near the camp site.  When they started out they heard something paralleling them in the woods. As they were returning to camp the child did a series of whoops, which provoked an immediate response.  KB said the whoop had a pronounced \"wh\" sound at the start and ended with a clear \"p\" When KB asked the five year old if he was scared, the five year old said, \"I'm not scare cuz it's Bigfoot that's scared of me!\" KB split up the group - KB and the five year old continued on while two remained behind, and something large approached the two who remained behind.When they returned to camp to discuss the events, KB began to see what's best described by some as eye glow - a phenomenon long associated with Sasquatch.  He and another person would trade positions, and the other person also saw the same glow; which was orange, changed in intensity, moved back and forth, leave, then return. When KB examined the location the next morning, the spot was below the horizon and where there were few tree branches.The next evening about 1:35 am they began to hear something large walk near their trailer. And about 3:10 am something significantly shook the trailer three times hard enough that it dislodged the jack. As soon as one of the campers began to laugh (because two campers were sleeping through the event) the shaking stopped.All in all, KB did a great job recording the significant experiences of the two days.",
