            "Observed": "My Fiancee and I were each in our own cars on Highway M-35 drving home from her parents' house.  We were about 1/2 to 1/3 mile from home, I was driving behind her and on the west side of the highway, just for a brief instance, I thought I saw a shadow of a figure run off to the woods.  I didn't give much thought to it, attributing it to being night time driving and thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me.  A few minutes later after we both got home and situated my Fiancee asked if I saw anything on the side of the road on the way home. She said all she saw was a shadowy figure run into the woods as well, but it was good to know it wasn't just I who was seeing things!  Neither of us could describe what we saw aside from a big, shadowy figure. This was only two days after I had heard a bizarre shrieking noise in my yard.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This couple are both college educated, reputable people. I interviewed them at their home and joined them at the site of where they saw the figure. These two locations are only a couple of miles apart from each other.The place behind their home, where they have heard noises or screams, could easily conceal any animal. Very thick swamp grass and cattails behind the house are 8 to 9 feet tall most of the year. I found bear tracks. She reported often having the feeling of being watched at night when she is home alone and said the hair stands up on the back of her neck when she hears the shriek, she is familiar with the sounds coyotes make. When he heard the shriek one night while watching tv, he described it as a bizarre sound that pierced the room. It was clearly heard over the surround sound, and the sound and eeriness of the shriek gave him goosebumps. He has heard coyotes in the area and said this was not one of them. Their dog behaves strangely at times, pacing the house. After visiting the site where they saw the figure, we estimated it would have had to be a bipedal figure 7 1/2 to 9 feet tall. He was in the first car and she in the second, she got a better look at the figure and a better sense at how very large and wide this figure was, and it turning to head into the woods. There is one well-used trail from the swamp on the west side of the highway, unfortunately it was under water during the investigation making it difficult to look for or find tracks of any kind.  The spot where they saw the figure on the road has a game trail right there and a spot on the opposite side of the road where something could easily slip in and be hidden. These are photos of a branch that is about 7 feet off the ground that is broke/twisted back towards the tree and away from this trail and road. 12/7/13 I went back to do a little follow on the sighting. The broken/twisted branch is 6 feet 6 inches of the top of the snow and ice. Once everything melts that would put it another 8 to 12 inches higher. There is heavy animal, mostly deer, traffic on the trail next to the twisted branch. The daylight photo was taken from where she first saw the figure, and the orange hat in the tree marks the twisted branch and where the figure was standing.",
