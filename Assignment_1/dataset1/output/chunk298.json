            "foot size.2": "n",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the gentleman a day after his sighting. He was driving mid-afternoon on a cool (70 degrees) sunny day, traveling northbound on I-95. Cars in front of him began braking; passengers were pointing to the side of the road. He looked and saw an approximately 8ft high, all black, hairy, bipedal figure along the tree line. As noted in the original report, its arms were very long and the back was hunched over. It didn\u0092t have much of a neck. The creature was about 15 feet outside the fence, walking amongst the trees. Facial features were not seen as it was striding away from the road. Although this creature was witnessed near a major Florida Interstate, the area it was seen is very wooded and rural with a low population density. The forest is oak, pine, palmetto and cypress lowland. This time of year it is dry, but can become marshy during the summer. Deer and hog are abundant in the area. Although this is the first report BFRO has taken for Indian River County, the area provides a viable habitat for large omnivores.  ",
