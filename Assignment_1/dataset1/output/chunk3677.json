            "Follow-Up Report": "In a first discussion with the report submitter, he described his brothers\u0092 story (which was submitted to a magazine but not published) and how he thought that it could be a possible Bigfoot encounter. He also described another experience they both shared in the same general area and, after my suggestion that it was also worth noting, submitted a report for it as well. It is added here at the end of these notes as an additional account. After obtaining his brothers\u0092 permission and providing his contact information, I interviewed him by telephone, during which he vividly recounted his unusual experience. This witness is a 49 year-old lifelong hunter and outdoorsman who had previously been on six or seven hunts in this same location but has not been back since this incident. He was initially hesitant to talk about this experience and was, throughout our discussion, never willing to ascribe it to a sasquatch, although he frequently repeated that he could not assign the behaviors that he observed to any animal that he was aware of or experienced with previously.The location of this incident is approximately three-quarters of a mile up along Hansen Creek, a tributary of the South Fork of the Conejos River in the South San Juan Wilderness Area of the South San Juan Mountains.As he approached his downed elk, intent on quickly cleaning the carcass, he immediately heard something large and heavy moving just away through the thick brush but presumed that it was likely to be a bear. However, whatever this was, after retreating twenty yards back or so, remained uncomfortably nearby, pacing back and forth with shuffling footfalls, moving around continuously but not moving further away, even after he had shouted several times to drive off the assumed bear. He has seen bears many times, both in the field and in camp, and was convinced that this was not typical bear behavior. He found this all \u0093too odd\u0094 and \u0093started to get creeped-out and scared.\u0094  Although not at any point overtly threatening, it was certainly intimidating and discomforting. Apart from one remaining arrow, he was unarmed and therefore decided to pull away. \u0093I hated to surrender my elk,\u0093 he said. As he started his half-hour hike back downstream to his campsite, he was astonished to find that whatever it was was now apparently following him. In the first several minutes of his return, at least two or three times, he thought he heard the sound of footsteps following and would stop. \u0093When I would stop, it would stop.\u0094 Each time he heard one or two additional steps from it before it also stopped, always remaining 15-20 yards away out of sight and in cover behind something.  He yelled again, hoping to scare it off, but wasted no time with further delays and returned directly to his campsite.Shortly after arriving and grabbing the security of his handgun, he was amazed to again hear footfalls approximately fifty yards away. He was curious as to what this could be but also growing irritated and angry about this continuing situation. With the added confidence of the gun, he ran toward it only to then hear the sounds of it crashing away for several seconds. He heard nothing else that night and, upon returning the following morning, was surprised to find his elk seemingly untouched.---------------The following account is the other story as submitted by the original report submitter after our discussion. It is from the same general area in September 1992.\"My brother and I had backpacked deep into the South San Juan Wilderness area for a week long archery elk hunt. On our third day of hunting we returned to camp very late, probably two hours after sunset. We were very tired so we just made a quick dinner on our small camp stove (we didn\u0092t bother with a campfire) before crawling into our respective tents (we each had our own tent, pitched about 30 ft from each other). I had only been in my tent 5 -10 minutes, and had just settled into my sleeping bag and closed my eyes, when I heard heavy, rhythmic footsteps walk past my tent. I was confused as to why my brother was out walking around camp after I thought he\u0092d already gone to bed for the evening. I called out \u0093Jim, I thought you went to bed already!\u0094 He responded \u0093I am in bed! I thought that was YOU walking around out there!\u0094 Then one of us (I don\u0092t remember which) said \u0093There must be a damned bear in camp!\u0094 We both unzipped our tents and shinned our flashlights around but didn\u0092t see anything. Whatever it was fled before we could spot it.Bears in camp are not all that uncommon, but something about this incident struck both my brother and me and very unusual:\u0095 The footsteps were very heavy, and definitely had a bipedal \u0093cadence\u0094 to them. It sounded like they were made by a large man wearing heavy boots (which is why my brother and I each thought it was the other out walking around).\u0095 While it\u0092s quite common for \u0093park bears\u0094 to raid campsites, this behavior is uncommon among wilderness bears, who\u0092s normal reaction is to flee at the first sign of humans (especially during hunting season!). If a bear had entered our camp I would have expected it would have done so during the day while it was vacant, not at night when it was occupied.\u0095 My brother and I had gone to special pains to \u0093bear proof\u0094 our camp. All food was stored outside of camp in bags high off the ground. The only things we kept in camp were our sleeping gear and spare clothing. In other words, there was nothing to draw a bear into our camp.\u0095 The animal entered our camp only a few minutes after we retired to our tents. This indicates the animal was probably there all along, waiting just outside the light of our camp until we turned off the lights and made it safe for the animal to approach. If this was an actual Bigfoot encounter, it\u0092s likely we may have crossed paths with it as we returned to camp in the dark, and for whatever reason it had decided to follow us for some distance back to our camp.\u0095 Neither of us ever had any sense that we were being \u0093followed\u0094 or \u0093watched\u0094 prior to this encounter. We didn\u0092t have any further incidents during the remaining five days of our hunt. The only other thing of note is that the area we were hunting in usually has an abundance of both deer and elk, yet we saw very few of either even though we hunted dusk-to-dawn for eight straight days. They seemed to have left the area.\"David Petti",
