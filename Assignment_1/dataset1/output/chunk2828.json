            "Observed": "I was out frog gigging. It was late I`d say around ten thirty at night. I was headed home. I remember it was really dark that night because there was no moon. To get home I had to walk along a ridge down a tractor path, the path went straight to our house. There was a gap at the edge of the woods line and I had cross a barbwire fence. As I neared this gap I was starteld by something getting up from the ground not 12 ft away from me. At first I thought it might be one of my grandpas cows, but cows don`t stand on two legs. It was black and tall maybe 7.5 to 8 ft tall. This encounter lasted maybe ten seconds max, I`ve hunted all my life and never seen anything like that. It scared the fool out of me, it stood up and looked at me and I just stood there and looked at it. Then it turned and took of down into the woods. It swung its arms like a man and I could hear wide bipedal steps. I never smelled it, and it never made a sound. All I could hear was it moveing very fast away from me. I run home as fast as I could scared to death. I told my mother what I had seen and she told me I was crazy. I never told anyone else what I saw that night but my wife and she believes me. I had herd weired screams at night and once during the day close to the house and it made the hair on my neck stand on end. But I haven`t heard anything there in a long long time. Could it have left?  This all happen in '87.",
