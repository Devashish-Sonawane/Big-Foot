            "Observed": "I went on an overnight backpacking trip with my son. We hiked about 4 miles down the trail and then hopped off the trail and down a hill to a small lake off of the trail a ways. We setup camp and then went scouting (looking for elk). We returned that evening, started a fire then went to bed in the tent. At 4:00 AM I awoke to some noise, I always awake easily while camping due to concerns of bears getting into our food. I heard some branches break about 50 yards from the tent and then an extremely loud scream/howl noise I have ever heard. I don't know how to explain it, but it was nothing I've heard before. I grabbed my pistol and flashlight and sat quietly in the tent. After a couple of minutes a heard a couple more branches break and that was it. We planned on leaving at 5:00 am to catch the elk while they were out feeding, but I decided to head out at that time. We packed up our stuff and left at 4:30. Yes, it freaked me out and we got out of there.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness over the phone.  I am familiar with the area in which this incident occurred.  This witness is a lifelong resident of the Morton/Randall area and has hunted there all his life.  He knows the wildlife which inhabit the area, and the sounds they make.  This vocalization was so loud that the witness said the sound seemed to reverberate in his chest.  He said that this was unlike anything he had heard before, and that it upset him so much that they left the area within a half hour of the incident.  Whatever the creature was that he heard, it approached from the east, up-hill and towards their camp in which there was a campfire.  This is behavior that would rule out deer, bear, elk or cougar.  I believe that this incident involved a sasquatch which wanted this man and his son to leave the area. ",

We drove up to the manufactured home got out of the car and was looking into the windows of the house when I heard a high pitched screech yell that seemed to echo from the north side of the hills. I asked my brother if he heard that and he replied no. I said \"listen\", and the same high pitched screech yell occured. It happened again and that is when my brother heard it. It seemed to be far away. There was a small \"A\" cabin next to the property that was vacant and it was very quiet at the time we heard the sounds. No one was around and the sounds seemed to echo. In total there was four of them every 5 seconds or so. Then it suddenly stopped. The time was around 3:15pm and it was overcast. It was very calm and quiet. It was not an elk or a dog. This was a sound we have never heard before. After finding your website it does sound like many of your recordings but from a further distance.",
