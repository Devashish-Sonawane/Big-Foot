            "Observed": "While traveling along Dark road skirting Monkey Mountain in NW Missouri, a tall thin creature of possibly 7' in height crossed the road in front of my vehicle. The creature was coming off the steep side of the hill heading towards the river areas. This animal was quite thin with sparse hair that was long and flowing, I got the impression it was quite old. It did not seem to notice I was there. It crossed the 10-12' wide roadway in approx. 3 strides, it was unhurried.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. His 21 year old son was with him, but asleep at the time of the sighting. The witness saw the creature in profile from the left side. It did not even turn to look at the vehicle. He got the impression that the creature was old and \"not doing very well\". He noted that it \"was not walking with any kind of authority\". The creature appeared very thin and about seven feet tall. It's hair was grayish silver in color, about like that of an opossum. The hair was thin, \"almost like mange, the hair was kind of like in tufts on the shoulder area\". At the shortest points the hair was about four inches long; in the thickest areas, the shoulders and back of the arms, it may have been a foot long. The hair bounced with each step. The skin was visible through the sparse hair and appeared grayish in color, except the facial area which was darker and brownish in color. The creature leaned forward as it walked and the arms swung loosely, but without much animation. The left arm appeared to move in sync with the left leg, the forearm also appeared to rotate toward the slightly with each step. He never saw the leg full straighten in stride. The creature moved with a \"soft bounce\". The arms appeared to be longer than waist length, the hands were \"very long\" and reached to about mid thigh. He saw no features which might indicate gender.The face in profile was shaped \"like a coconut on it's side. It did not have a sagged crest.\" It did have a pronounced brow ridge, the forehead was not very high. The face was slightly pushed forward about like \"a chimp making a kissy face\". The cheeks appeared to be puffy, with loose skin under the jaws. The neck was noticeable, \"somewhat elongate\". He got the impression it may have once been more muscular than it appeared at the time. The head did not appear to set directly in a straight line on top of the neck; where the skull met the neck it was somewhat pushed forward. He did not notice the ears. ",
