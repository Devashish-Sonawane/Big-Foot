I heard a loud thump on my truck door and thought someone had threw something at me or that I had hit something. When I got out of the truck and walked to the other side their was scratches all down my passenger truck door. I got extremely scared so I had my dad and brother come get me, and that is when we then found footprints all along the middle of the dirt road and it went on it seems like miles. As we were taking pictures of the footsteps, we heard something. My dad shined the flashlight into the field we saw greenish looking eyes above the brust and a little off to the distance. My brother ran with the flashlight towards it, it stood there as he got closer it just disappeard and we started hearing loud knocks and a really weird growl so my dad yelled and made my brother come back. It was the scarest moment I have every had",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On 2/02/12 I met the reportee and her father at the location of the incident.  The area is a combination of woodlands with hardwoods and farmlands.   The exact location borders a field that still had standing corn and also a large deer food plot.  There were 3 visible deer blinds and plenty of deer sign.  There are also numerous farm animals both seen and heard at the house directly across the street.   I seen and heard cows, goats and chickens.   The game trail  that the animal was standing on or near is a perfect observation spot to study the road, the farm across the street, the standing corn field and also the food plot.   It would make perfect sense why a squatch would pick this exact spot to stand.   It was never clear what caused the dent and scratches on her vehicle.There is about an acre of woods that borders both a dirt road to the south that runs east/west and a cornfield to the east with a foot plot to the north/ northeast.   The witness stated that when she heard something hit her vehicle she stopped and got out to look.   She heard something in the brush on the north side of the road and got back into her vehicle and called her father.   Her father and brother arrived shortly after and used a 2 million candle power spotlight to shine into the woods.   They stated they heard a growl and then seen green eyes lit up by the spot light.   The eyes were approximately 8 feet off the ground.   I went and stood in the location and her father stated the eyes were 2 feet higher than my head.   I am 6'2\" tall.   Her brother walked towards the eyes and got to within 40 yards of the animal.  During this time they could hear what sounded like wood hitting trees and a loud growl.   They could also see a shadowy outline of a tall upright figure.When the brother stopped 40 yards from the animal with the eye shine, the eyes suddenly disappeared.  Her father yelled at her brother to get back to the truck, which he gladly did.  They could hear very heavy foot falls and movement in a northerly direction.  They also seen a general outline of something very large and upright.The day after I received the report we got 6 inches of fresh snow, which erased all track evidence.  There was a well-used game trail running right by where the animal stood and there were signs of different kinds of animals using it.   After sharing the pictures of the tracks that they photographed that night, I and several other BFRO investigators, who are excellent trackers, stated that they were possibly human boot tracks and therefore inconclusive. The area has many acres of state forest as part of the Au Sable State Forest as well as many plots of farm land.  There are numerous creeks and rivers in the area, including the Tittabawassee River which is a short distance away.   Other reports in the area also seem to follow the Tittabawassee River system and tributaries.   ",
