            "Observed": "My husband, parents and I had set up a camp in the Medicine Bow National Forest.  Our camp consisted of a fire ring, cooking table, large tent and 3 vehicles.  My parents slept in the tent and we slept inside our truck.  My husband awoke at 5:30am to go elk hunting.  He got dressed in the truck cab then exited the cab and continued to get his hunting gear ready.  He had gotten a late start and it was beginning to lighten up outside.  I sat up in the truck for a second and out the back window saw a black figure run between my parent\u0092s tent and the 3rd vehicle.  I only saw the figure for \u00bd a second and I only saw the torso up.  I had just woke up and around the edges of the truck window had a little fog around them, so I initially I thought it was my husband, but he was still standing between the truck and the 2nd vehicle.  I laid back down and got to thinking about what I saw.  I sat back up and started watching my husband move around the camp.  He was wearing his camo overalls and a camo coat.  The way he moved was slow and sluggish compared to what I saw earlier.  My husband soon left to go hunting.  Maybe 10 minutes later, my brother pulled into the campsite and parked his vehicle and walked into the woods to go hunting.  He to was dressed in camo and was nowhere near as smooth and fluid as what I saw running.",

Her recollection of events during the interview matched her submitted report. Her dogs' actions were most notable, as the usually outgoing dog was staying close by wanting attention instead of roaming. There was also a rustling in the bush the night before.The height of the creature was described as approximately5'8\"-5'10\" and slender in build. She once again told me how fluidly the creature moved compared to her husbands' movements. There were no neck features giving a \"hoodie\" look. The area has ample water and food sources, including but not limited to squirrels, turkey, and various plants that produce berries in the spring and most of the summer.----------------------------------Editor Comment (Matt Moneymaker):This report was originally categorized as Class A.  It was subsequently re-categorized as Class B because it was a fleeting glimpse.  Class A sightings are those where there was a long enough and clear enough observation to eliminate any potential for misinterpretation. A clear sighting doesn't eliminate the possibility of a lying witness, or a third-party costume hoax, but it does eliminate the most common cause of a false report -- misinterpretation.",
