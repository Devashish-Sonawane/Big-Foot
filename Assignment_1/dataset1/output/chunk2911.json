            "Observed": "I did not see anything just heard. I was out hunting in an area called Brooks Marsh, after walking a fair bit around the marsh on the trail about 4 miles. I came across a turtle shell that had been crack in half  as if it had been picked up and slit in one go. I went just a bit further to where the trail split and sat down to wait for deer before I got to my spot I saw another turtle that had been cracked around like taking the chocolate off the outside of a reese's cup. After setting in one place I started to hear oooop it was different tones in five different spots, 2 down below me to my left rear, 2 off to my right along the road and, 1 further down almost to the end of the marsh. The loader of the ooop was from the one at the end of the marsh and to two to my left. The 2 along the road sounded as if lower tones and up in the trees. I stayed there for about 15 minutes listening, some of the sounds vibrated through the valley. I stood up and headed for my rig when everything went dead silent no sound from anywhere but what I made. I walked along the trail for about a 100 yards I heard a crack as if a baseball bat hit a bat with a wosh, wosh, wosh and hitting the brush. Because I was hunting deer and nothing larger I continued on my way. I felt as if I had went the other way I would have seen something.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone. While hunting near a marsh, the witness found two broken turtle shells he thought about two to three days old. The first was broken in half as if a piece of toast was broken in half. The bottom shell was not pulled from the top shell. The second shell had one leg hole opened wide. Each shell was on a log. The logs were thirty to forty feet apart. No scratches or bite marks were found on the shells. After the witness sat down, he heard whoops from five different locations. Some seemed to be coming from up in the trees. There was always one whoop with ten to twenty seconds between each. This lasted for fifteen minutes and stopped when he stood up. He is confident it was not ravens. Then he heard a whack as if a baseball bat hit a baseball.He thinks a piece of wood broke off and flew through the brush as he heard the whoosh about forty feet away.The witness hunts this area often. I find him very credible. His wife submitted a report regarding the prints she found, and we will publish once we have finished the investigation. ",

            "Observed": "A college friend and I where camping just out of Index. We got up on a late damp Saturday morning about 10:30. We decided to take our cameras and [get] some pictures of the wilderness. I [have] lived in Washington my whole life and spent a lot time in the woods with my father. He moved here from Tennessee and was excited to see the wilderness of Washington. We spent a lot of time around the North Fork of the Skykomish that day. About 3:00ish we went back to camp and chose to go down a part of the road we camped on that had been blocked off by small trees that had fallen across (it looked like it had not been used for a long time), in [the] hope [of] finding some cool river shots. We headed south down the road thru the damp brush about a 1/4-mile. As we were walking in the area I noticed some small tree that where broke off at about 8 to 9 foot height and 4 to 6 in dia., at the break. It made me curious but I didn't say anything to my buddy. Then about a hundred and fifty yards or so, (give or take) we walked across a soft area in the road. At first I saw [only one] footprint but looked again, it was big and other than the ones we left it was the only one. It looked like the right footprint but no others, we found the soil was too firm. I asked my friend to put his foot next to it to compare. He wears a size 10 1/2 to 11 this was much bigger. I repeat, much bigger. So I took pictures of it with my camera.",
