A stream runs through Mescalero, crosses under the highway and runs along what is called \"The Old Highway.\"  It is at two sites along the old highway that two sightings have recently occurred.  Homes are located along this road, with some just back from the highway.  The sightings occurred at (name withheld) place about a mile or so from Hwy 70.",

Evidently he has seen and heard things on the ridge of (withheld) Canyon.  There have also been reports of trash cans/dumpsters being rummaged through, and people emptying their trash catching something in their headlights at these locations.",

One, which is sort of a legend, involves a Hispanic woman who lived at or near Capitan, was supposedly kidnapped by a Bigfoot some years ago and finally came home with lots of broken bones - and pregnant.  The child grew up \"looking funny\" (so I was told) and always looking for a fight.  In August 1997 the family told me about an Apache man who was at a feast somewhere out on the reservation.  He left the clearing where the ceremony was taking place and went to the woods to urinate.  As he did so, something allegedly picked him up and flung him about.  I am told that this man is big, and about 6'2\" tall, but he was tossed around easily and scared to death.",
