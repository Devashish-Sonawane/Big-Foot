Additional info gathered during the interview:The face was described as a \"chestnut color\", \"dark and weathered.\" The hair on the rest of the body was darker and matted in parts, especially on the legs. It had deep-set brown eyes and a heavy mouth but thin lips.|After it first got up, it seemed be \"foraging\" around. He said it was overturning logs and rocks along the creek bank. He said the hands were \"massive\". He could not see the animal's feet because of the brush. Both men decided to return the next day with dogs to look for footprints and gauge height of the figure. They were dissuaded by the nervous behavior of their dogs. [There will be a BFRO expedition in North Carolina in September of 2006]",
