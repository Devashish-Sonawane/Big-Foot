There were no vehicles pulled off of the road either above or below location of creature.

I did not even know your site existed until I happened across the Discovery channel program, \"Sasquatch:  Legend Meets Science\", one night when skimming channels on the TV.  What caused me to stop to watch the program was the segment on biomechanics/kinesiology, digitizing with computers, and the professors from Idaho State University.  I have a son who is studying Anthropology at Idaho State.  After watching the program, I looked on the internet to see what sites were on it, and came across yours.",

It was early evening (around 5:45 pm), and I was driving in the westbound lanes of I-84.  I had encountered heavy, thick fog at the top of what is locally known as \"Cabbage Hill\".  It also began to snow.  The roadway was snow-covered and slick.  Traffic was moving quite slowly (20-30 mph).  Trucks were moving especially slow due to the steep roadway, poor visibility, and slick roads.  Traffic was backing up.  There were 5-6 vehicles, including mine, travelling as a group, with 2-3 in the left lane and 2-3 in the right.",
