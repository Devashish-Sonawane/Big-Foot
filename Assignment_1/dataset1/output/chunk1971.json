            "Observed": "Going fishing last year at Mogadore Reservoir off Ranfield rd. Late night around 1am in the morning we had caught a couple of catfish. A 7lb and a 15lb. My truck was parked roughly 20ft behind us. Throughout the night I heard tree knocks and calls not common to the area. When we heard a few getting closer we decided to leave. When i went to the back of the truck where we kept our gear and the fish the 7lb catfish was gone. We looked around the truck and area to see if it had hopped out and saw nothing. While searching my partner was hit on the chest with a small rock leaving a half dollar sized mark. We packed up and left fast since we felt very scared at that point. I came back to the location a a couple of times since then and noticed trails and branches that were twisted and snapped that couldnt be done by normal means. I have encountered things in southern and mid ohio previously and all i could determine was this was a close encounter.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness in a telephone interview and can include additional information.  The fishing spot is a favorite of the witness and his friend and they frequently fish there.  On this particular night they caught two large catfish and as they were caught, they took them and placed them in the back of the truck.  The witness estimated that the distance from the spot where they were fishing to the truck was 20 feet.  The witness also claimed that they were the only ones in the area.  They had not seen or heard anyone and had not seen any flashlights or lanterns that would indicate that anyone was in the area. The witness has an interest in Sasquatch and that is what led him to believe the sounds he was hearing were Sasquatch related. In speaking with the witness, he confided that he just had a feeling that something was in the area.  Both he and his friend had heard movement, but couldn't be certain what was moving around them.  The witness said he just had a feeling that something was near and that they should leave the area.In my initial and follow-up conversation, I found the witness to be credible and consistent in his accounts of the event.  In fact, his experience is consistent with many witnesses that I have interviewed.  Reports of similar noises and the feeling that they are being observed is common as well as as the onset of a feeling that they should leave the area.  Fisherman and hunters have also reported their quarry disappearing.  Rock throwing is often reported as well.  Additionally, BFRO report #23980 is also in the vicinity of this witness' encounter.",
