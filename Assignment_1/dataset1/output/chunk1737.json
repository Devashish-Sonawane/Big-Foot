            "Follow-Up Report": "The land area near this report in the southeast corner of Grand Traverse County is literally surrounded by National, State and other public land.  The Pere Marquette State Forest, the Manistee National Forest and the Pere Marquette River make this a prime area for animals and game of all kinds as well as a place for camping, hiking the North Country Scenic Trail, hunting and fishing.I contacted Mr. H regarding his sighting and we initially spoke about our mutual interest in mountain biking.  I have been in the middle of the deep woods and have had a mechanical issue before, but to have this occur and see something that is not supposed to be there was something that I had to try to understand.  Mr. H wrote down his recollection of the incidents so that it would be easier to piece together.  After I received his letter I called him again to ask a few follow-up questions regarding the actual location of the incident and the distances involved during his encounter.  The following is his letter to me reproduced as he wrote it.  I asked Mr. H if he could clarify the incident and provide some situational awareness to allow us to better understand what he experienced.  Areas designated with \"( )\" were changed by me to reflect new information or the will of the witness.- The weather for the incident was 60-65 degrees, cloudy with a brisk wind, the time was 6pm with good lighting. Since you are a mtn biker perhaps you can relate more to the type of terrain that was present. I was riding through a rooty rocky single track that went uphill and turned into a sandy hill, which is where I came to the \"opening\" in the woods. I actually smelled the smell before I stopped to put a new tube in my front tire. Imagine an opening in the woods that is very square, it was obvious it was clear cut long ago, but had fire weeds and tall brush growing everywhere. The trail I was riding was at the very \"left\" side of this opening, if you can orient that in your mind, while the other side of the clearing was on my \"right\" which is where the burnt rv/trailer was situated. The \"sound\" that came from the trailer was an unmistakable boom, followed by hollow knocking.  At this point I was nearly done repairing my tire, it was not until I glanced up again and saw the head. (The \"head\" was positioned behind/outside what would have been the far side of the trailer if it had been intact i.e. the witness was looking past a wall that was burned away into the inside of the trailer looking out the far window).More about the \"head\" - As I explained before, the window in this trailer was roughly 6 feet from the ground, the head was large and from my distance appeared round. It was, from my distance  very hard to pick out details, but one thing that I will never forget is how the wind almost made the \"fur\" flow slightly around the face as if it was very long. Again no eyes or ears were present, just a very stout large head and the beginning of the neck. As I began to mount my bike again, this is when it tilted its head to the right very slowly, this is also when I saw very slight definition in what I believe was \"longer\" hair. (The head tilt was later described to me as being almost a question or a form or recognition that this creature saw something interesting as well).More about the \"smell\"- Having worked for the (    ) and being in nature for many years I can say this smell was unique and I have only smelled it once more near my mother's house after the howls I heard near Waterloo Rec area. I can only describe it as a wet dog that just emerged from the swamp mixed with skunk. The smell wasn't overpowering but very \"there\". The smell was actually much more pungent the next morning as the wind had subsided. As far as my experience at my mother's house near Waterloo, I have not heard any more vocalizations, but have smelled very pungent odors on several other locations, If I come across a recording or can capture some recordings I will forward them to you. (I sent Mr. H recordings of various known and unknown wildlife sounds for comparison to the ones he heard when his mother knocked on his door).Mr. H and I discussed the fact that he believed that in the morning after his biking incident he could still detect the smell near his cabin even though this was miles away from his sighting.  This led him to believe that whatever it was in the woods the previous day had followed him home that night.  He looked around for any sign and was unable to see anything.  This was the most unnerving part of the entire incident.",
