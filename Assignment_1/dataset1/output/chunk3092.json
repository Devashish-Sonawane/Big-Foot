            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with both witnesses on separate phone calls. He, a family female friend, and his son and stepson were fishing late at night. He saw something move out of the corner of his eye, turned to face the direction of the trees, and saw a a figure duck behind a tree. He said to his friend,\"you're not gonna believe this, but guess what I just saw\". He directed her attention to the trees. They both saw it peeking in and out from behind a tree. The tree was about 150-200 yards or so away, and slightly up a hill. The moon was mostly full, so even at that distance, they were both sure of what they were looking at. The height was estimated at 7-8 ft, though at that distance and lighting, it is hard to be precise. They shined a large flashlight and there was eye-shine both with and without the flashlight shining. This peek-a-boo lasted for about 45 minutes or so. They said nothing to the kids. They were a bit uneasy, but felt the distance between it and them provided a safety net. Towards the end of the encounter, one of his boys landed a fish, so he moved down to the bank to help him reel it in. It was at that point she heard the scream, then a knock. He could not hear it because he was closer to the flowing water, and also helping his kid. A single knock was heard, and the scream was a 3-4 second sound similar to a high pitched yell. The scream got higher pitched towards the end. She is familiar with a screech owl , and said it was similar to a screech owl, but was definitely NOT a screech owl. More of a scream and not a howl. The knock and scream both came from the immediate area of the figure. It peeked in and out from behind the tree seven times. She kept count. Could have been more but they were not looking at it non-stop, as they were watching the boys fish.",
