            "Observed": "Being an avid outdoors man and interested in various types of wildlife since childhood, I've had my share of camping, canoeing, hunting, fishing, finding Native American artifacts, and hiking, etc.  On one particular sunny spring day during 2011, I decided to walk some trails adjacent to Brendan T. Byrne St. Forest opposite Rt. 70.  On one side of the sandy/gravel trail is a pine forest, on the other a downward slope into a densely wooded swampy area where a stream flows.  At one point a few yards into the swampy area, I heard an unrecognized sound similar to a cross between a bird call and a whistle type noise at which I stopped dead in my tracks in attempt to see what made this unusual sound, but saw nothing. Within a few seconds just to the side of this noise I heard the smashing and crashing of large wet logs on a level the likes of which I have never heard before.  This ruckus appeared to be purposeful in origin as if the creature was attempting to make as much noise as it possibly could...And it was succeeding!  Having known several friends and family members who declared witnessing large bipedal hairy creatures in New Jersey, I immediately surmised this, too, must be a Bigfoot or Sasquatch type creature.  After all, I've worked several seasons with very large animals at Great Adventure's Safari Park. I've touched, fed and/or pet elephants, rhinos, American Black Bear, European Brown Bear, tigers, leopards, bison, elk, etc., therefore I feel I have slightly better idea as to the average person, what size animal could make such a disturbance.  In addition, I have a fair understanding of a variety of large North American mammal's behavior, and this seemed to fit nothing other than Bigfoot.                                      As I stood there mostly in silence, the animal slowly proceeded deeper into the swamp, all the while smashing and crashing.  Since I understood that bigfoots normally don't harm humans, at one point I quietly verbalized to myself, \"MAN, THIS IS REALLY COOL.\"  On the other hand I thought that if this thing is as angry as it sounds, I didn't want it to come bebopping onto the trail, since there was likely little or nothing I could do to protect myself.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness at length by phone. The incident occurred back in 2011, but he felt compelled to submit his report based on new findings in the area.Jeff restated the events of that day back to me, as was submitted in his report. There was no visual aspect, but the sounds he reported are definitely ones that could unnerve even the most seasoned outdoorsman. I found it interesting that he thought it was \"Cool\" to be experiencing the thrashing sounds, and he also said that he thought it might have been trying to get him to think it was moving out of the area, or that there could have possibly been a second individual nearby. Jeff has personally had a tremendous amount of experience working with large animals, and I believe that he could easily distinguish between a known forest animal, and one that may be out of place for the region. He continues to venture out on hikes and on his dirt bike into the woods near his home.The area that this took place is in the Pine Barrens, a vast area of land that has had numerous sightings over the years. There are many streams and lakes, plenty of sources of food, and ample ground cover, and definitely could support the existence of a large as of yet undiscovered primate. I found the witness to be credible and truthful, and I give this report a Class \"B\" rating.",
