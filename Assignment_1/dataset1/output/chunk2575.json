            "Observed": "My boyfriend and I were hanging out around our campfire when the most unusual terrifying sound filled the air around us close to or just after 1100 PM. It was difficult to tell what direction it was comeing from, it seemed to surround us. It was a high-pitched screaming sound with whoops, reminicent to a siren and it was fairly continuous. It sounded otherworldly and struck fear into us instantly. We froze in terror and listened for about 30 seconds as the screaming whoops got louder and closer-sounding. Then we ran to the truck and honked the horn like crazy. The sounds continued and we sat listening for a good ten minutes as the sounds continued but seemed to move further away. We exited the truck and tore down camp immediately, pausing every few minutes to monitor the distance of the sounds, jumping into the truck for a minute or so again when the sounds would get close, honking the horn occasionally for good measure. We pulled out of camp at 1145 PM. On the drive down the hill we spotted a deer crossing the road. When we got home exhasted as we were we got right on the computer and googled coyote calls to compare to what we heard. Nothing quite fit, the closest we got was to audio of a whole pack of coyotes hunting and vocalizing. This morning, unsatisfied and curious I googles \"screams in the woods\" and found your site. When I listened to the 1978 recording in Washington of whooping screams I felt like I was right back in camp. THAT is what I heard EXACTLY!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "For the other camper's perspective, see report  26497. In addition to the report, the following details can be noted:\"I was struck by the length and fairly continuous duration. It had no pauses for breath. All I could think was that we were surrounded by the loud sounds and echoes.\"\"Throughout the day we were walking around the campsite, pulling dead underbrush for firewood. Up the road we saw fresh bear scat. It\u0092s an abandoned logging road. Upon examination, it looked like berries, and was fresh and moist, so we'd better get back to camp. We adjusted our camp in case we had to vacate the tent to avoid a bear. We also made noises, being silly, to not attract any bear, but warn them away.\" \"We listened in shock for 30 seconds to the big scream, and that\u0092s when we jumped into truck, honked the horn, and turned the lights on. It seemed like we listened for ten minutes, but it might have been as little as five minutes. Time is weird when you are scared like that.\"\"I have seen a few television documentaries, so I knew that [sasquatches] could be out there, but I never thought or worried about it. Now, I want to know what this was.\"",
