There were no other people or vehicles along the road he traveled; and the rock was the size of his hand. He saw the rock travelling in an arc, about 12 feet off the ground at the apogee.  I asked if there were any rocky outcroppings which the rock may have fallen off. He stated the hillside, while steep, was coverd with the normal duff found in a hardwood forest. There were no outcroppings visible and the hillside leveled off above the embankment. ",
