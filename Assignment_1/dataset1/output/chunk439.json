            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to JH by phone. My impression of him was that he was a no-nonsense individual, and that he was telling me the truth of his encounters. JH is adamant about the legitimacy of his experiences.His first encounter with what he calls the \"Taylor Wild Man\" took place when JH was very young. While growing up in a house near Taylor, Florida, JH shared a room with his sister, and recalls seeing a large, bipedal, hairy creature in the yard from his bedroom window. It stood on the opposite side of their parents' \"full-sized\" Ford truck. He described the creature as \"taller than the cab of the truck\", and that the cab was \"as high as its rib-cage\". \"It wasn't a man,\" recalls JH. \"It was real big and hairy all over, and stood up like a man. But it wasn't a man.\"The second encounter happened from his and his sister\u0092s bedroom window, which JH described as being about six feet from the ground. \"A hand reached up and touched the window, and me and my sister saw it. It had five fingers like a person's hand, and it was real big and furry. But it wasn't a person's hand. When my sister saw it, she cried. We were scared.\"JH\u0092s next encounter happened two years ago while driving up Hwy 125. \"I saw something big and black on two legs, about \u00bc mile up the road, cross over the road. It was big. Maybe about 10ft tall. It wasn't a man. It was too big.\" JH stated that he was too far away to be able to see any fine details except its height and overall bulk, which he says was not consistent with the shape and frame of an average man.The last encounter was the one that JH submitted to the BFRO. After his encounter while hunting turkey, JH saw a \"bare-foot\" track that was about 15 miles from the nearest road. It had five toes, was similar to a human track, and was six inches wide and 13 inches long. JH has been exploring the woods for as long as he can remember. He has been hunting since he was five or six years old. He is very accustomed to the regular wildlife in his area, and attributes his encounters to a being that he has become very familiar with; the \"Taylor Wild Man\".",
