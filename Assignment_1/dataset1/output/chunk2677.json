            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone. The sighting took place in late winter possibly in the month of March.  It was raining at the time of the sighting.  The sighting lasted approximately thirty seconds.  The animal was running across the road and the witness was within ten feet at the closest while traveling by car.  They stopped after the animal passed in front of their car and backed up to watch it continue running up the bike path.  It never stopped and they watched it until they could not see it anymore.  The witness describes the animal as over seven feet tall, muscular, thick and broad. She saw the animal in profile as it ran across the road so she was unable to describe any facial features, although she did state that it had a conical shaped head with little or no neck.  It was dark brown in color.  She was unable to describe the running style except to say, \"that it was unlike anything I have ever seen\".  When asked to elaborate she was unable to describe it any further.  The area has a history of sightings which include another sighting on this path to the north.  The Cuyahoga National Recreation Area is close by, as is the Cuyahoga River.  Food sources are plentiful in this area. There is large amount of  deer and other animals in Cuyahoga Valley. This region also has the highest number of traffic accidents involving deer.  Ohio has a deer overpopulation problem, in large part because of the amount of corn and other crops grown there.",
