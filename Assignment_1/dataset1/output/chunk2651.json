However, I lived in SE Washington at the time, and it wasn't that far away, maybe 90 minutes. After reviewing maps of NE Oregon, there is a \"river\" in that area with an unusual name with several small creeks feeding it: the Wenaha River. I also recall the encampment had a small parade ground, perhaps 1/3 to 1/2 the size of a football field, with a small pond, both of which were elevated from the river by no more than 15 feet. I also seem to recall parallel to the river at this point a forest service road.",

This is the identical Mill Creek that provided many reports of activity by Paul Freeman, Wes Sumerlin and Bill Laughery in closer proximity to Walla Walla, WA. The stream in question is a small contributory of Mill Creek. The site is approximately 8 miles west of the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness Area.",
