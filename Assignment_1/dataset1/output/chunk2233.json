The figure was at least as large as a man, if not bigger, and was completely black (or dark in color).  I was seeing it from aprx. 150 feet away through my car windshield.  It was overcast on Christmas Eve.  It lept with one leg behind it and an arm high above it like a man leaps the long jump in track competitions.  When I got closer I realized that the creature was moving into a heavily wooded area.",

Further details were revealed during our conversation.  The animal was in the road at the beginning of the sighting and with three steps was across the road and the ditch.  When asked the witness did not see the animal anymore as it disappeared into the forest.  The whole episode only lasted about 3 seconds.  When questioned the witness described the animal as dark in color, tall - approximately 8 feet tall.  The witness only saw the animal in profile and stated that its arms were longer than a persons, and that the head, although not conical, did have a sloping to it.  The sighting was within several miles of the Cuyahoga River.  There are streams, lakes and ponds in the area, as are farms.  The area is plentiful in flora and fauna.",
