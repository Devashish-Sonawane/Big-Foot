The following details can be added to the report:--Witness was 16 at the time, brother was 17 and friend was 15.--No one else was on the trail or at the lake.--They used the trail that circles the lake and fished on some big rocks.--Screams were extremely loud and angry.  Seemed masculine and adult.--First scream lasted for at least a few seconds; second came about one minute later and also lasted for a few seconds.--Scream came from directly in front of them (across the lake/North) and was about \u00bc mile away.--Felt that whatever was screaming could see them (but he didn't feel watched), and that the screams were probably aimed at them to leave the area.--They knew it was not on the lakeshore, because they would have seen it.  It must have been above the lake, above the trail, in the dense forest.--The screams scared them badly, and after the second one, they took in their fishing lines and ran all the way home.--Unless his sister had told him about the other Bigfoot story, he would never have associated the screams with Bigfoot.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with, and interviewed the witness in depth.  He is very credible as is his girlfriend, with whom I also spoke.  The witness is very familiar with native wildlife and is a man that doesn\u0092t scare easily.  His experience, however, has clearly unsettled him and has made him much more vigilant of his surroundings.  I will, also, note that his dogs apparently have been moved by the experience as well.  They now rarely leave the perceived safety of the back porch since the initial event.I will not recap all of the details of our interview as the witness has covered everything in his report.  The day after the initial vocalizations, the witness and his girlfriend, described seeing a \u0093three foot square patch of fur\u0094 several yards out from the fence line that was moving away from them.  The fur was described as being similar in color to that of an \u0093Irish Setter\u0094 dog and as being \u0093wavy.\u0094  I had the witness stand at the location from where he saw the fur and I stood where the fur was seen.  This area is moderately to heavily vegetated, and the ground is sloping slightly downhill from where the witness was standing.  I measured the distance from the ground to where the witness saw the fur.  The patch of fur would have to have been five feet off the ground as viewed by the witness.Being a visual tracker, I walked the environment looking for both ground sign as well as top sign.  Other than the possible footprint that the witness described, I did find several large human-like tracks, measuring around 21 inches long and 9 inches wide in another area of the property.  Due to the nature of the ground cover No attempt was made to make casts of the tracks.  Also, the tracks had been altered slightly due to recent weather.  The environment contained several high limb breaks that could have easily been caused by nature.  One, however, was a small tree that had recently been broken off at the top by twisting and was still green with leaves.  The break measured 10 feet off the ground and there was nothing in the environment that suggested how this could have been done short of it being manually twisted and broken.  This particular location offered a very strategic vantage point of viewing the property.This particular area of Paulding County (near the Douglas County line) is very near Sweetwater Creek which has been an area of alleged bigfoot sightings going back, as far as this investigator is aware of, for thirty or more years.   This area, as is very common now, was once an extremely rural area which is now seeing more and more development.  This may account for the recent activity at this location.  Any new developments regarding this case will be updated here on BFRO.",
