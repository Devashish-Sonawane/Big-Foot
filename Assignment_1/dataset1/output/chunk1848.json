            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this young witness, who is now 17 years of age, on February 10, 2008.  At the time of the encounter, she had gone for a casual walk late in the day near the base of a small forested mountain just north of her family's property. It was still warm after a hot day in August. She heard rustling around in the brush just ahead and directly to her left. Seconds later, she was stunned to see a very tall, hirsute, dark-colored biped step out into a tiny clearing 20-30 yards in front of her and look at her \"dead in the eyes\" with what she interpreted to be a \"sinister\" type look. The witness took a step back and the creature slowly turned and departed back inside the tree line. She further elaborated on the subject's appearance and described it as looking very ape-like in both its discernable facial characteristics (dark gorilla-like facial skin) and muscular upper body that was \"very buff.\" The animal appeared bipedal and human-like, except for being covered in very dark brown, \"almost black\" hair. She also described the subject's head as being average-size in relationship to the body and \u0093round\u0094 on a short, almost absent neck.She estimated the animal's height as being close to 8 feet. It stood with a slight slouch; the lower limbs seemed proportional to the subject's size and stature, but the arms appeared \"a little lengthy.\u0094During the 15-20 second encounter, the witness also described a strong, foul-smelling odor that she later concluded was similar to that of a skunk but much stronger.After the subject disappeared inside the tree line, the witness \u0096 quite shaken up \u0096 retreated towards her residence at a very brisk pace. She was reluctant to return to the location, but did so several days after the encounter. In regards to the faint \"footprint\" mentioned, when the witness returned to the site, she retraced the path the animal took and found an indentation which appeared to have the outline of a single, large and bare footprint with 5 toes. She was not able to find any other track impressions. She believes with its size and estimated stride it could've easily stepped over a nearby fence into thick vegetation along any point of the brush-concealed fence line.Five and a half years later and now a senior in high school, her and her family still reside on the same property. Although she's heard of other bigfoot sightings in the Callahan range, and the towns of Tenmile, Lookingglass and Glide (northeast of Roseburg), she hasn't experienced any other bigfoot activity around the family property. On several occasions she has heard strange, howling vocalizations late at night. She can't be certain these were bigfoot sounds, but they were unusual enough for her to take notice. Note on the region: The Callahan Mountains are a series of small, crag-like forested mountains overlooking the Flournoy Valley west of the town of Roseburg. Due to the diversity in both climate and soil, this scenic southwest Oregon valley is considered historic wine country and is made up of a series of interconnecting small mountain ranges and valleys including both the Klamath & Cascade Mountains, as well as the Coast Range (further west). Although this area is heavily logged with many clear-cuts, there continues to be a consistent history of reported bigfoot sightings by locals in the densely forested sections of the mountains and logging roads.It's also worth noting that coincidentally, several months before this witness' report submission to the BFRO, fellow BFRO researcher Cliff Barackman & myself, while traveling through the state of Oregon, camped within just a few miles of the witness' residence in August of 2007 and spent one uneventful evening there. Interestingly enough, that location was suggested to us by a friendly Oregon Fish & Game Warden we met at a Roseburg service station earlier in the day. He also kindly shared with us several detailed and recent bigfoot encounters he was personally aware of.",

Our house was situated at the back of a long cove and uphill from the lake. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains a zone around the Lake in which no development or clearing of land may be done without a permit so as to maintain a natural forested shoreline. The topography of the area is very rugged Ozark mountains and steep terrain. Large tracts of Mark Twain National Forrest make up the area and most land, even private, is still covered by forest. There was much development of homes and home sites taking place in my area at the time.",
