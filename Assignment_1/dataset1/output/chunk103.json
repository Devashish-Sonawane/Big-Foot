            "Follow-Up Report": "After a lengthy onsite interview with the witness with a fellow BFRO investigator present, we managed to pinpoint the exact spot of the road crossing. Its a state route with some decent traffic flow during the daytime hours. It obviously was moving very fast as it crossed the road in three steps and proceeded down the west side of a farm house towards a big field that eventually leads to some forested rolling hills. The witness noticed how long its stride was crossing the road and how long the legs were. He could only see it from the waist down. The other car did slow down and he could see them hitting their brakes in his rear view mirror after they passed by. He said the color of the legs were a very dark black. This landscape is quite typical of east central Ohio. Deer activity was noticed the day of the investigation. The witness stated that the area is flooded with deer during the evening hours.
