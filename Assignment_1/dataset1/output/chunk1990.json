            "Observed": "My father and I are both proud Mountain State natives, although we no longer reside in WV. But we do enjoy returning every spring for trout fishing and sometimes smallmouth bass fishing. My father and I have been fishing the West Fork of the Greenbrier for trout for years and also enjoy camping there. We set camp up about a 1/4 mile from a little tiny place called Wildell. Its way out in the middle of no where. Our plans were to fish and camp April 26th, 27th, 28th. The first night was quiet and we just got some sleep. The next night around the fire we just decided to try fishing on the West Fork again instead of going to another stream. We were really tired so we ate a quick dinner and went to bed. My father snores really loud so I sleep in a separate tent. I was sleeping but kept hearing noises in the background, which is normal in the woods. But I kept hearing this screaming sound waaaay off on the side of the mountain across the road (which was in front of the camp). I didnt bother me much and I just kept trying to sleep but it kept getting closer, louder, and was just constantly screaming. It got so loud and close that at one point I litterly woke up, sat up quickly in my tent and said out loud \"what the #*%# is that!?\" At that moment the sounds stopped. I dont know if it heard me say that, hear me shuffling around in the tent but for whatever reason it stopped instantly.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After a lengthy phone conversation with the witness, the following information may be added to his report:-The first set of screams woke the witness at 3:30 a.m. on Friday morning, May 27th.-The screams came from the east, drew closer to his camp, and grew louder for thirty minutes.-At 4 a.m. the last scream was heard just outside camp, at an estimated distance of 75 to 100 yards from where the witness lay in his tent.-The vocal was so loud that the witness could \"feel\" it with his body.-He immediately sat up in his sleeping bag and asked out loud, \"what the 'explicative' is that\"? Where upon the vocals immediately ceased and were not heard again that morning.-The witness was so disturbed by what he heard that he could not go back to sleep that morning.-Over breakfast he discussed the vocals with his father, but his father being a very deep sleeper, did not hear the vocals at all.-Through the course of the next day the witness and his father fished the local trout waters.-On Friday evening, at 11 p.m., the witness was back in camp with his father and sitting by the fire. At that time both the witness and his father heard a loud, long vocalization coming from the opposite side of the river. The witness estimates its origin at 400-500 yards from their camp.-The vocal lasted about 5 to 6 seconds, started loud, and grew even louder about halfway through its length. It carried well over the noise of the river and had a distinct vowel sound to it, a short a, similar to the word 'hat'.-The witness noted that the ambient noise of the river was loud enough that while fishing, he and his father had to shout loudly to hear each other at distances as short as 50 yards.-Before both vocal incidents, the witness and his father had been cooking in camp, including beef and bacon. The witness noticed when collecting wood well outside of camp that the smell of bacon permeated the area.-Upon reviewing the audio clips on the BFRO website, the witness felt the Snohomish County Whoop-Howl were most similar to what he heard.-Report 7474 also occurred in this vicinity.",
