My wife and I were at our seasonal camp on Lake George for the early season.  We had bed for the night in front of the fireplace.  There were only a few lights belonging to other early season camps across the lake.  It was a calm night.  My wife was sound asleep.  She often sleeps through thunder storms.  I was up throughout the night.  I was awake for the sound of the first scream.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on 10/25/2006.The witness experienced two vocalization events represented on the BFRO web site as two separate reports:Below is a summary of the two events in chronological order:1. Report #15565The second incident occurred on May 11, 2002 at 2:30 a.m. Three to four screams were heard about five seconds apart. It sounded somewhat like a human female, but, more powerful and blood curdling. At first, the witness thought it was a some type of bird, but, quickly dismissed that idea because of the sheer volume of sound, as if coming from a big animal. The witness believes the screams were coming from three different animals; one was very close to his camp, the others were as much as two miles away. The witness speculated they were either calling to each other or was territorial in nature.2. Report #15566The first incident occurred on March 31, 2006 around noon. The witness hiked into a pond southwest of Sabbath Day Point. Approximately 300 yards further southwest of his position, he heard a very loud and powerful, \"sing-song\" type of vocalization. This vocalization went on for a continuous two minutes. The witness described it almost speech-like, as if the creature was carrying on a conversation. But, the witness could not hear any reply in return.",
