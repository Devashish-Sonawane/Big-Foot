            "Follow-Up Report": "Click here for the page showing the photos, and mentioning follow up recommendations.I drove to Vancouver, WA last night and met with the witness and his son regarding this report. He is 48 years old. He does a lot of solo backpacking. On the day of November 17, 2005, he decided to solo backpack at Silver Star Mountain, just north of Washougal, WA. While on the summit he noticed a rock that looked strange and out of place. He said, \u0093I\u0092ve been up there enough to know every big rock along the way, and this rock didn\u0092t look like something that I\u0092ve seen there before\u0094. He got out his camera  (a Sony 3.2 mega pixel) and took a photo. As he was doing this the figure suddenly stood up and started moving. The witness (\"RC\") felt that he wasn\u0092t in the best position for additional photos so he moved along the trail as far as he could move. He was in waist-deep snow. He noticed that it was much more difficult for him to move than the figure. The figure seem to step around easily in the snow. He was able to shoot two additional photos before it disappeared out of sight over the top of the hill.The witness stated he never attempted to look for tracks. The snow was too deep at the summit to move around easily. ",

            "Observed": "On 6/10/06 My daughter and 8 youth from the Suquamish Tribe we doing beach clean up at Jefferson head. At about 2:00 p.m. the girls started hearing what sounded like a woman or animal sreaching and screaming, The sound made them very uncomfortable and some of the girls returned to the adults who were on the other end of the beach. My daughter says here friend Cori spotted it first it looked like to them  nothing they had seen before. With parents who hunt the are aware of what wildlife look like and are certain it was no bear. It walked out of the marsh and seemed to be startled with the girls as it tried to quickly duck behind a large piece of drift wood. It did not run away it continues to watch the girls from a crouched position,poking his head out from the side of the wood. The girls ran to the van and demanded to leave the Beach.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Interview of witness was not possible.    The young lady  who experienced the encounter is not willing to talk to anyone outside the Suquamish Tribe and is still very upset about the entire thing.  I have pieced together information from the actual witness's mother whom I interviewed by phone, and also from David Mills, the Tribal Forester who spoke with the witness.    As follows:    The girls who experienced the sighting were in groups of 2-3 working along the shoreline doing community service.   Some were listening to music on their Walkman  and did not hear the wailing screams coming from the woods, until they were signaled by others waving their arms frantically.  Something or someone was howling and screaming from the cover of the wooded shoreline.   Then it emerged out into the open, in plain sight, described as a figure broad in shoulder, covered in hair except for the face and hands, walking on two legs. It had long matted, scraggly hair, and was a dark reddish brown color.  The bipedal hairy man figure approached the group who were by now ready to run for their vehicle, parked \u00bc mile away.  The figure continued to get closer to them by dodging between the beach drift logs for some small bit of cover.  By this time the girls had heard and seen enough and bolted for the van.     This area has had ongoing activity for nearly 10 years as been investigated by others in the bigfoot community.   No investigators have been on the property since 2000.  The cycle appears annual and most if not all incidents occur during the months of May through October.   Based upon eye-witness statements and local knowledge that the Tribe has, there is a very high degree of likelihood that sasquatch visits and forages in this forest.  There are migration pathways where one can go undetected  to other remote beach areas and then all the way into the Olympic Mountain Range.   The Tribal Forestry Manager for the Suquamish  escorted me through the gated, private property on October 23, 2006.   This same forest has had a history of encounters and sightings since 1997.    Hair has been collected from this site, analyzed by professionals and came back \"no known animal\".    The two of us spent the entire day hiking, photographing and using gps to document the area.tie reports:Report #13721Report #7441",
