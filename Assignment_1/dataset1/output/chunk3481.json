She had seen the Patterson movie before her sighting.- The animal\u0092s surprised expression was very human-like (raised eyebrows).- The animal\u0092s expression looked \u0093sweet like a grizzly bear\u0092s\u0094- D.H. did not notice ears, teeth, or unusual smells.- She skinned her knee when she slipped as she was running back to her tent.- She wished she could have appreciated the sighting more when it happened.- D.H. didn\u0092t tell anyone for many years for fear of ridicule. - She only recently told her family members.- D.H. is a business owner and her family has a related business.  She did not want her name used for fear of negative impact to her family\u0092s business.",
