            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness is a 44 year old retired electrician. He is currently serving as a pastor. Sighting took place 200 yards from a creek. The area is rich in food sources and vegetation that include briars, pine thickets and honeysuckle. When he imitated what he heard, I thought it sounded like classic Samurai chatter. He also stated that he got the impression that it was upset, by the tone of its chatter. After the experience, this witness went to our website to find more information.  He also listened to our  Bigfoot/Sasquatch-related sound recordings.The witness stated he knew the possibility of what he was seeing was a bigfoot because of his interest in the subject. Because of the distance and probably waning light at that time of the day and month, he was unable to see any details. He was basically seeing a tall, uniformly dark figure walking on two legs. Although he did not see it clearly, he was certain it was not a person due to its behavior and its estimated height of 7 - 7 1/2 feet. He conducted the height comparisons on his return the following day.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The area of the sighting was in a tall grass prairie flanked on both sides by deciduous woodland  next to river bottom.. Brush, vines and miscellaneous species of vegetationmade visibility of more than 20 feet difficult according to the witness. There is a network of gullies (ravines) associated throughout the area that  branches out from the river system.  The prairie grass varied in height from approximately five feet to ten feet tall.  Although the witness felt some people bow hunt whitetail deer there, he did not think many people worked this area.  Besides whitetail,  It also has an abundance of cottontail rabbit,  squirrels (gray and fox)  and other wildlife.The witness  first noticed something out of the corner of his eye and when he turned,  noted a brownish figure that had wide shoulders and was covered with hair.  He was very surprised since he thought it was his cousin at first. He stated the face was darker than the rest of the creature.Details were made from approximately 15 yards away.The  figure  was seen to be standing in the prairie grass and was exposed from the stomach region up through the shoulders (estimated at approximately four feet wide).The chest hair was patchy but the muscles could not be seen in the abdominal area due to hair cover.The witness mentioned that the head was larger in proportion to the body than that of a human being.It was roundish at the top and the face was quite dark possibly due to skin coloration and a lack of hair which wasn't focused on due to the short time that the creature remained in view.   Facial detail was limited to the brow which was enlarged and the nose which was human like but larger, wider and appeared flattened. .The bigfoot was estimated at 500 pounds, possibly more, by the witness who himself is a big man at over 250 pounds and over six feet in height.   The muscle structure was evident through the hair on the upper portions of the body.(shoulders, upper limbs)Shoulders were described as massive.  The triceps and biceps of the upper arm just bulged. \"Really big!\" the witness stated.Final take:  It was silent and it left the area quickly.   The witness feels he got a glimpse of a giant prehistoric manlikecreature.  He continues to hunt after his sighting knowing that he was lucky to have this observation.     ",
