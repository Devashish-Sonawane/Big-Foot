            "Observed": "Never saw anything but 4 years ago my friend, his son and I went camping up near Mount Adams ( A very remote campground) and we were hearing strange screams right before nightfall. Shortly after dark we could hear something messing around on the outskirts of our camp, breaking large branches and such. Around 12am or so my friend was going to bed and unzipped the tent and something very large jumped and ran off from behind the tent. Whatever it was shook the ground to point that I could feel it from about 15 feet away. Later that night I awoke to garbage cans being hit or thrown..at first far off but moving closer over a few minutes time. Then I heard something walking at the edge of camp and it grunted loudly. I had woke up my friend and his son and without my being aware he said a really loud \"BOO\" as I was intently listening for sounds in the forest this scared the holy # out of me.....about had a heart attack. We heard no more sounds that evening.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have met with the witness and discussed his encounter at great detail. He has been camping at this particular spot for nearly 20 years and claims that the experiences he has outlined here began in 2005.  However, he has had some sort of experience nearly every year since then. In addition to what is outlined here, he claims to have heard whistling and possible sasquatch vocalizations, also known as \"samurai chatter\", during the encounters and the mornings after. The man in my opinion is not only sincere, but very astounded by what he and his friends experienced. He told me that he will be buying some video equipment in the very near future and returning in an attempt to obtain some sort of video evidence in the near future.",
