            "Follow-Up Report": "I did view the videotape that was taken at the scene the following day the tracks were found. Impressive but I knew that I had a better chance at seeing the tracks for myself later that afternoon.Upon arriving on scene, the witness K, filled me in on all the details of what happened before they went off into the forest.I did find other impressions of large tracks that were still part of the original subject. Also, I had the opportunity to compare impressions with bear tracks that were less then a few hours old. Impressions were measured and the bear tracks found were used to identify subject from other known animals in the area.The odd colored hair mentioned in their report was of an elk.   It appeared to me to be some type of natural salt lick which was the source of attraction to the stump.I did stay until midnight with witnesses. We walked a couple of roads and they wanted know what the BFRO does while out on expeditions or investigations involving overnight stays.Listed were four witnesses, I had the opportunity to meet K and C, but not the other two. I talked to the third witness T.  He was the first to contact me by phone. Each conversation, with T, K, and C matched each other\u0092s story.  All witnesses were interviewed separately, either by phone or in person.I did view the cast taken, plaster of paris was the compound used to create the casts. They were unable to get Hydrocal in their area and used what they could before the tracks disappeared.Hair samples were collected in two separate areas where the subject had walked and they were sent off to Dr. Henner Fahrenbach for his expertise on the subject. Will update the report when I receive his final analysis.Sample one was taken from a small sapling, at a height of sixty-four inches.  Also present were bear markings or scratches on the tree.Sample Two was taken from another tree, which was laid over onto another tree, at a height of about forty-two inches.  It was presumed that subject may have stepped over the sapling.  UPDATEHair samples collected from the area were of a bear, according to Dr. Fahrenbach (7/9/05). Dear Mel,Both samples were bear hair, only the short piece was much more pigmented than the longer one.Keep the hair coming!My best, Henner. Sample one was of a bear.  Sample two I was hoping to be our subject.  Strand was of a different color and texture and it was stretched, causing it to curl. Thinking is. . . the spring left in the tree as the bear stepped over, snapped it up higher as it passed.Thanks to Dr. Fahrenbach's assistance.Even though the hairs turned out to be of a bear. Tracks found and followed in the area were of a much larger and different subject.END OF REPORT",
