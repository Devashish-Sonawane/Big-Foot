The eyes looked to be the size of a reflector on a bicycle. Before the eye shine was witnessed, the dogs at the neighboring house started whining, barking and acting strange. I happen to know the neighbor. The dogs are trained to hunt bear and raccoon. Generally the dogs are quiet when in there kennels.Tyler hunts this field every weekend and is familiar with the surrounding area and the animals both wild and domestic. The coyotes were unusually quiet this evening. The hunting party was using a FoxPro Call with the sound of a deer in distress. He uses a Vortex Razor HD 20x50 scope on his rifle.The area has sufficient cover, food and water to support bigfoots, as well as several ways to exit from the place of the sighting.",
