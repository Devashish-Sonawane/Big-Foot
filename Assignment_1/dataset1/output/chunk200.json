            "Observed": "It was a mild day and I decided to take a walk in the woods. After traveling about 5 or 10 minutes down a woods road I heard 3 deliberate and distinct knocks which emanated about 50 yards away from inside the brush off to my left, it stopped me dead in my tracks. I have read many of the incidents on BFRO and I could not believe what I was hearing. I composed my self and found what I considered a sturdy stick and struck a large pine tree close by in the same manner as I had just heard. It took about 5 seconds and a reply came back but only 2 deliberate knocks this time. A couple of seconds later  another sound came from a direction parallel  to the first but about 50 yards apart. This sound was like a tree being struck but with the stick breaking on impact. When the stick broke it sounded like it had a girth of a couple of inches. I struck my tree 3 more times but nothing more happened. Let me add that as I was strolling down this trail I was smoking a cigar and the wind was blowing into the direction that the knocks came from.  I continued down the trail which takes you to the edge of a pond. While exploring there I found an interesting thing. Lying on the ground was what looked like a 3 foot wooden club with a jagged end where the roots would be, it looked like something that you would see in a cave man picture. There were also 2 holes in the ground one next to a tree, the hole about 12 inches in diameter and close to 20 inches deep the other about 5 feet away from the tree 3 or 4 inches in diameter and only 4 or 5 inches deep with the club laying on its side and the small end partially in that hole. I believe that this club dug both holes because of the way the end was all rounded and imbedded with dirt. But I do not understand why.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a former hunter and outdoorsman and a part-time security officer.  He entered the area from a trail head located on a quiet residential road and did not see any parked cars or hikers on the way in or out during the approximately 45 minute roundtrip hike.The initial three wood knocks were described as loud and lasting for approximately 5 total seconds.  The subsequent set of two wood knocks originated from the same approximate location as the first set of knocks with approximately 2 seconds in between the first and second knock.  The final distinctive sound emerged from the other (right) side of the trail, however upon further questioning the witness was uncertain if that sound was a wood knock, a tree branch snap, or footfall from a large deer.The witness resumed his walk and after 15 min. arrived at the shore of Assawompset Pond. In this general area, the witness observed the natural wooden club and also photographed one possible wood structure. Follow-up investigation showed that the wooden club weighed 7 lbs. 2 ounces and the larger of the 2 holes had a depth of 18 inches.The witness submitted two photographs of the large fecal pile that he found on the trail the following day. The largest fecal piece was tubular, smooth from end to end and approximately 8 inches in length. The interior of the feces revealed numerous thin white hairs scattered throughout.The incident occurred in the Assawompset Pond Complex which is comprised of the Quittacus, Little Quittacus, Assawompset, Pocksha and Long Ponds. Assawompsett Pond is 4 square miles and is the largest natural inland body of water in the Massachusetts, is closed to public recreation, and provides drinking water for the nearby city of New Bedford.  The 10,000 acre Assawompset Pond Complex is comprised of 50% oak-conifer transitional forest, 40% lake/pond and 5% palustrine wooded swamp.  The complex and surrounding wetlands are critical spawning habitat for one of the most productive runs of Alewives and Blueback Herring in the Northeast.This incident occurred approximately 12 miles northeast of report 25364 and approximately 10 miles directly south of report 8972 located near Abington, MA.  Assawompsett Pond is located approximately 10 miles southeast of the Hockomock Swamp, a 6,000 acre uninhabited wetland within the \u0091Bridgewater Triangle\u0092. Hockomock is a Native American name meaning \u0093Place Where Spirits Dwell\u0094 and this area and the Bridgewater Triangle have had reports of paranormal events dating back for centuries. Locals refer to the \u0093Hockomock Monster\u0094 based on several reports from the 1970\u0092s that describe a hairy 6-7 foot tall bipedal animal.",

            "Observed": "In November 1996 just a couple of days before thanksgiving my best friend and I were camping and deer hunting on Weyerhaeuser forestry land in SE Oklahoma the nearest town would be Smithville but even at that it would somewhere around 9 miles as the crow flies. (Land has since been sold to John Hancock Corp). This area is in the same general area as where my written report occurred.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The submitter has a scientific background and is an extremely articulate and credible witness. These details can be added: \u0095 Description of Creature: He estimates the weight to be between 700 to 800lbs. Its build was massive and extremely muscular. Its shoulder width was approximately 40 inches wide, with a slight tapering towards the waist, but \u0093Boxy\u0094 in appearance. He was not able to distinguish a neck. He described the hair as being so dark brown that it was almost black and uniform in color. The texture was coarse like horse hair. The hair length was 2 inches all over with the exception of the bicep area where it appeared to be slightly longer. The hair on its head was described as \u0093Someone having a bad hair day\u0094, it was frizzy, matted and spiked up in places.  The skin on the face was dark and covered with short hair. When the creature snapped his head around to find the noise, a prominent brow ridge was noticed. Its hands were huge and its arm length was long and out of proportion. Its legs were proportional to its body length but shorter in length than the arms. The creature had very well developed Gluteus Maximus muscles, forming what the submitter called a \u0093Bubble butt\u0094. The creature\u0092s feet were not in his line of sight. \u0095 Locomotion details: The creatures gait was very methodical when first seen. He walked in a very smooth, slowly effortless glide. When it was departing it sped up slightly, but was unhurried. It took three long steps and was out of sight. He believes that the creature was every bit as curious about him as he was about it, and he got the distinct feeling the creature would have stayed longer had they not been interrupted.\u0095 He did not see any facial expression because of the distance between them, but he did notice a visible physical change in the creature when he leaned his gun against the tree stump. He reported the tension in the muscles in the arms and chest relaxed. \u0095 He did not tell his hunting partner about the event. It took him 6 months to digest what he had seen. He has no question of the intelligence of the creature he was viewing, reporting that what he witnessed was very close in appearance to a human being.\u0095 The witness holds a position within the Department of Defense that is classified as sensitive critical. He delayed submitting this report for this and other reasons:     \u0095 He did not have physical evidence to confirm the event.     \u0095 He had no idea where to file a report in 1996 and the newspaper was not an option given his security clearance.\u0095 The sketches and map that follow were created with the help of the eye witness. The written report he referenced in the first paragraph of this report is:Report #3240",
