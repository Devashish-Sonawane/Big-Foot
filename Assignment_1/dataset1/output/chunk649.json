            "Follow-Up Report": "While cutting wood on a trail near his property in the late afternoon, BH stated that he felt the \u0091hairs on the back of his neck stand up\u0092. Having a feeling that he was being watched, BH turned and observed a hair-covered bi-pedal creature watching him from about 40 yards away from behind a small tree. \u0093I think it heard the sound of chopping wood and that\u0092s why it came.\u0094 BH stated. \u0093I think it must have sounded like I was making wood knocks.\u0094After observing the creature for about 10 seconds, BH realized what he was seeing and became frightened, slowly backing away, watching as it turned and calmly walked into the woods. He thought he could hear its footsteps as it walked off, but isn\u0092t certain. \u0093I was scared, but I don\u0092t think it was going to hurt me. I just didn\u0092t want to stay there to find out.\u0094According to BH, the creature was over 8ft tall, covered uniformly with black hair, and had enormous 4ft wide shoulders and very muscular. When asked to describe the face or head, BH stated that he wasn\u0092t focused on the face or head, but that its body was \"huge and muscular\". He also stated that just before the encounter he began to smell a very rank odor. \u0093I didn\u0092t think anything of it at the time. I just thought that there was a dead animal nearby.\u0094The area BH was working in is very rural. Situated close to the Chipola River and several large wilderness preserves, it is highly feasible that bigfoots would habituate this region. ",
