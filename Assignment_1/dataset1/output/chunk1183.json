As soon as she went to take a photo of the individual it had moved. Very shortly afterwards as she was leaning on the steel guard rail behind her car she felt the vibration and heard the sound of the first rock hit the guard rail. She reported that they heard the sound of the rock rolling down through the brush on the other side of the rail after the rock made contact. Her husband asked her to get in the car for safety because of the rock throwing and as she entered the car and rolled up the window a second rock hit as noted by her husband who had his driver\u0092s side window open. She estimated the figure to be between 7' and 8' tall.Photos taken and submitted by Ellie -Ellie has drawn in the figure in this photo where it was seen:Close up photo of where the figure was seen:",

My partner just stood there looking into the canyon.I didn't speak to him. After another couple minutes passed, the scream occured again. I knew that he had heard it both times. I asked him what he thought it was. He asked what I thought it was. I told him that we both know it's a sasquatch. The sound was very loud. If I were to guess it was 250-300 yards away. Over the next ten minutes, the scream occured 2-3 more times. It seemed that the sound was directed to different directions the last couple screams. My hair was sticking up and it quite literally scared the hell out of me. No more screams were heard.(more to story)",
