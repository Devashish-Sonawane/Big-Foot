            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and visited the location of the sighting after the witness had moved to another town. The following additional details can be added. The RV park is bordered on the west and north sides by a small creek that flows south under Hwy 4 into an arm of Lake Granbury. The culvert under the highway is large enough for cattle sized animals to pass through. The creek is wooded on both sides, thinly on the RV park side and thickly on the far side which also has a rather steep wooded 30-50 foot tall hill next to the sighting location. Due to a severe drought, the creek was dry at the time of the sighting. The creek approaches within about 20-30 yards of the trailer in which he resided at the time.The witness was first alerted by 3 or 4 loud, high pitched whoops spaced over about 30 seconds coming from about 100 yards downstream of the creek. After the vocalizations, except for a howling dog, the woods went very quiet. He could hear heavy footfalls coming closer to his location, and smelled something like a mildew odor. While remaining in the creek bed, the creature walked into a clearing about 30 yards from him. Due to the lighting and the dark color of the creature, the witness could only see a man shaped silhouette that appeared to be facing him, estimated 9-11 feet tall, heavily built, with no discernable neck. He described the upper body as looking like it was wearing shoulder pads. The creature then slowly moved out of the minimal light and disappeared into the woods.Report #7552  is the BFRO report the witness referred to.I found the witness to be sincere and forthcoming during our phone conversations.",

The witness was living, at the time, in a valley area on the side of the mountain locally referred to as a \"cove.\" He described the area as \"remote at the time, but not anymore.\"  The house had been occupied only sporadically for several years, mostly in the summer, prior to the witness living there.The screaming vocalizations started approximately fifty to sixty yards behind the house. At that time the shaking of cedar trees and other brush could be heard. The vocalizations lasted eight to ten seconds each. The creature then moved uphill away from the house and along the ridge to the other side of the cove, vocalizing every four or five minutes for over an hour. Between the screaming vocalizations sometimes another sound could be heard.  \"It seemed like it would scream, then click rocks together.\"",
