            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted this witness and found her to be very credible. Her description was vey clear, even after 41 yrs. She was 12 years old at the time and a self-described 'tom-boy' who was afraid of little. After her experience, she was afraid to be alone in the evening and still is to this day. She was nearly 5'5\" tall at the time and this animal was at least 3 ft taller than her. Thick chest, broad shoulders and short neck. The animal was described as being hairy but not the type of fur you would see on other animals, more like long human hair but thicker. The witness recalled its face with its mouth shut and less hair around the facial area. Dark-skinned and the nose was wide and flat, but had a point to it. She really remembered the eyes. The whites were reddish and the pupils were large with a hint of blue. I hope to meet with this witness soon to have her show me where this sighting took place and to update this report with a possible experience from a couple years ago involving she and her husband. The experience occurred in the same area as her first sighting and where she has lived all her life.",
