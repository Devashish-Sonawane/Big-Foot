            "Observed": "In the early fall of 1979, my cousin and I were following some trails through the woods near my home.  These were trails that myself as well as the other neighborhood kids frequented often on bikes as well as foot.  It was a sunny day and warm.  After going approxiametly 60 yards into the woods I looked up onto a hill that was to the left of the trail that we were traveling on.  There standing, looking directly at us, among some small pine trees, was a very large being.  It was standing straight up on two legs, it was huge, at least 7ft tall, covered with medium brown hair.  It was standing as if frozen, I can still picture its arms and hands for some reason;  his hands were just like a man's except larger and covered with hair.  It's face was not totally covered with hair.  I froze in place and whispered to my cousin \"what is that?\".  She thought I had seen something on the ground she was not looking on the hill.  I just took off running as fast as I could toward the road, out of the woods.  When we were a good distance away I then told my cousin what I had seen and later we returned with a stick and large rock in hand but there was not sign of it.  There was also nothing on that hill that could have been construed as being anything like I saw.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.The witness stated that the animal was about fifty yards up the hill from her.  She remembers distinctly that the arms hung down close to its knees.   She was not close enough to make out facial features other than it appeared more humanlike than gorilla.  ",

I was sitting on my windowsill at 11 at night, i lived next to a large wetland/swamp area. my back yard was a large hill infront of the wetland. I was sitting on my windowsill and saw a large figure come out of wetland, walk down the hill, and then re-enter the wetland at the bottom of the hill. The figure was probally 7 feet tall (i doubt it was 8 or 9) dark in color, and very large in build.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on the phone. His house was in a cul-de-sac and surrounded by wetlands and woods. He said it was hot in the house so to cool down he opened the window and sat in the sill, which was about two to three feet off the ground. As he was looking around the backyard he saw it walking. He described his backyard as having a flat area next to a big hill with a dense grove of trees on top. It was out of this grove that the figure emerged. It had a \u0093really massive build\u0094.  It started walking down the hill to the base of the hill, across the flat part, and then walked into the swamp. He doesn\u0092t believe the animal ever saw him because it seemed \u0093pretty focused on wherever it was going. It was looking straight ahead\u0094. He described the animal\u0092s walk as \u0093lumbering, but not quite as ape-like as the Patterson film\u0094. He said the entire time he observed the animal it was on two feet and that it never dropped down on all fours. He said he wasn\u0092t able to see any features, but that he could see the build fairly well due to the moonlight. He said it crunched twigs and sticks under its feet as it walked. I asked if it appeared to be trying to sneak around the yard. He said it \u0093seemed pretty set on where it was going\u0094 as it walked into his backyard, and then into swampy area. At no time did it ever stop to look around. He found some \u0093depressions\u0094 in the back yard the following day, but nothing that he would call a clear footprint. I asked the witness if he has ever heard any unusual sounds near his home and he said that he hadn\u0092t. ",
