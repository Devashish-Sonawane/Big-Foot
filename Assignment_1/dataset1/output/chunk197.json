The following can be added to the report:The bipedal figure was seen walking along the tree line at a distance of 20-30 yards.It was big (stocky like a football player) and at least 7 feet tall, but could of pushed 8 plus feet.  The figure was light tan in color, but not uniform (different color hues were visible).The figure walked like a stooped personThe witness made direct eye contact with it. The eyes were red, but shined like other animals witnessed at night (the eyes did not project light).The bipedal figure took two steps towards the tree line, turned back and looked at the witness again, then proceeded into the timber.The witness has since purchased a dash camera because this is a frequently traveled route.  He will update me with a more exact location of this sighting the next time they pass through.   ",
