Its legs were longer than its arms, so it moved like a person trying to walk with their hands on the ground.--The animal must have been around 8 feet tall due to the drop off on the side of the road.--Witness heard screams as a boy scout in the Desolation Wilderness area in the early to mid 1980s.",
