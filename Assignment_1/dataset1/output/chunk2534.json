We were traveling westbound on a train going around curves between Bonneville, Cascade Locks and Dodson.  As we came around a curve near milepost 36, I saw something dark between the rails.  I said to the engineer, \"What is that\".  He then blew the whistle. Something tall and hairy with long arms got up and ran into the trees and brush. Its arms swung wildly when it ran. We looked into the spot where the animal went into cover, but could not see it. Time  was daybreak.  We got a good look as we aproached at about 15 rail car lengths.",

Kyle additionally described the apelike animal he saw as appearing to be interested in something on the railroad bed. The animal was sitting down between the tracks when first observed, then raised itself up to stand and ran away on two legs with its arms flailing back and forth. The creature appeared to be frightened by the train whistle.  We speculated that the great ape may have been intrigued by rail track sounds/vibrations from the oncoming train or may have been hunting food (perhaps seeds or insects or rodents)?This report is a first class original sighting.",
