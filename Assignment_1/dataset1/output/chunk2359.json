            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness has had several experiences on their property which backs up to a forest and wetlands area.  She explained that she was driving in her Jeep on a narrow path behind their home when something started running in the woods just off to her left.  She only got a side view glimpse of it for a few seconds, but she is certain it was not a bear or human. The creature was within 100 feet of the trail.  She described the creature as a tall, dark, hairy, man-like animal that was running on two legs.  She stated, \"If it wasn't a man in a gorilla suit, it was a Bigfoot!\"  She said its right arm was swinging with the run, but it was not a smooth run like you might expect a human to run.  The gait was a bit lop-sided and awkward.  It ran deeper into the woods and disappeared.  She also reported that the animal had a flat, dark face, although she does not remember if there was hair on the face or not. It was all one color and was at least 6 feet tall, more than 200 lbs. She described the hair as about 4 inches long and it was thick, like a gorilla.  She did not notice a neck, nor did the creature have a snout like a bear.  She also found a print that looked human like, but \"it was boxier than a human print.\"  Only two toes were distinct.  The print was found in the area near the visual.  She returned home to get her husband, but she could not find the print upon returning to the sight.  It was in the sand of a pathway. Over the years, she has had a few unusual sightings.  Twice she has seen what she believes to be a juvenile jumping across the trail behind their home, about 50 feet off their deck.  She was sitting on her deck at the time, and she believes one occurrence was in the summer and the other may have been more into the fall.  She has also heard some strange, loud screams coming from the woods, screams that sounded like a woman screaming.  She reported feeling as though she was being watched while sitting in her home at night.  She hung curtains to prevent whoever it was from seeing her in the house at night.  There are times she is fearful in her home and if she is out in the yard. feels as though she is being watched. She no longer walks the trails alone.The witness shared several other stories of experiences in the same area.  I have asked her to have those people contact me so I can interview them and file a report.  Other stories include a sighting of an upright animal crossing the road in the early morning hours; a young woman claiming to have something looking in the window of her trailer and her niece said she was startled by what sounded like a 300 lb. man jumping up and running in the woods when she may have frightened it as she walked along the same trail as the witness.
