As we were walking through the woods we saw what seemed to be a large extremly hairy creature. It stood about 7 1/2 feet tall and must have weighed about 350-400 pounds. It walked slowly with its arms hanging low and a hunched over back. My friend and I stood in amazement the creature slowly turned and stared at us for approx. 4 seconds, then turned back in its original direction and contiuned walking until it was out of sight. My friend and I quickly ran away and found the others and told them about our sighting...most did not believe us.",
