My dad , grandfather and members of the camp we belonged to were up there to cut firewood for hunting season. One night late my grandfather, a friend and me were the only ones still up.  We saw a tall creature come on the porch and try to kick the front door down.  It then ran off the porch and around the back of the camp . It let out the loudest yell/scream  -  it woke up almost everyone in the camp.  It was clearly walking on hind legs and had hands not paws and was a gray/light brown in color.",
