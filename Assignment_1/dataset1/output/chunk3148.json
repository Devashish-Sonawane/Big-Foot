            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness in a telephone interview and the following information can be included.  The witness had almost reached her residence when the sighting occurred.  She estimated that the distance between her and the creature was four car lengths.  The creature did not turn to look in her direction.  It continued walking into the woods.  According to the witness, arms and legs were clearly visible.  \"It covered the road in just three strides and long arms were clearly noticeable\" said the witness.  She also added, \"It was not a bear.\" \"I have seen bears and this was definitely not a bear.\" Additionally, she recalled that the fur was long and dark brown in color.  The witness also told me that when she got out of her vehicle, she could hear something large moving in the woods and could also hear branches breaking but nothing was visible.  According to the witness, the odor was immediately noticeable.  Gathering up the groceries was when she heard the high pitched \"woot\" sound.   At this point, the witness felt it would be best to go in the house.  She also confided in me that she was very nervous when she went back out to get the last bag of groceries as it was dark and the house only has one outside light.  I asked the witness if after her encounter, were there any other unusual sounds or activity detected around her home.  She replied no, but five days after her sighting she was outside and smelled the same pungent odor she smelled from the day of her sighting.  She claimed she couldn't see or hear anything but the odor was strong and it was unusually quiet.  During our conversation, I commented on her attention to detail and she replied that she keeps a journal and recorded everything she could remember about her sighting.  This is the first time she has discussed her sighting with anyone except her husband. She is concerned that people will think she is crazy and doesn't want to frighten her children or subject them to ridicule.  To date, the witness hasn't noticed any additional activity, but she remains vigilant and agreed to contact me should any activity return.",

Then I seen it stand up and run across the street to the wooded area. Both 30 yards from my house. It was dark outside so it was a dark massive upright figure standing 8-9 ft. Arms were about middle of its thigh. Couldn't see the facial features but before it crossed the street it looked both ways. The eyes had a little glare to them maybe a small eye shine. Also smelled like a musty odor for a bit later on in the night. I was sitting in the house and heard a deep scream howl kinda noise and it went on and off the rest of the .",
