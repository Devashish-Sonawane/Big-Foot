The night they had their sighting was a rainy, foggy night, and when they first noticed it they were about a block away.  They proceeded to slow down a little and as they drove by, they saw it peripherally, not wanting to look directly at it.  The sighting lasted about 10 seconds.  It was described as definitely being taller than a normal human, with dark hair over its whole body.  From what they could see of its head, it was 'sloping downward', with a huge jaw and a chin that almost touched its chest.  It moved very fast, with long strides to its gait.  The creature never turned to look at them, and continued walking the whole time without moving into the forest. They later had to stop and 'catch their breath', trying to figure out what they had just seen.This sighting took place near Shades and Turkey Run State parks. ",

At about 3:00 pm all three of us were talking on the front porch when Vic (the friend) suddenly stiffened and stared looking very intently up at a nearby foothill, and called our attention to something \"funny\" moving around up there. Jim (my then husband) Vic and I watched two taller and one smaller brownish creatures move back and forth for about ten miniutes. Then Vic suggested we go take a closer look. The spot was along an exposed streach of an old logging road (which abound in the region).",
