Rolled my window up, it turned, looked at me, had my bright lights on, in two steps crossed the two lane road , then went up the mountain. Scared, omg, can't believe what I saw, still shook up ! Very dark, that animal was dark, matted hair, from what I could see in my headlights. My guess, height wise, close to nine foot. Very tall. Happened on Carl mountain, near Quinwood, West Virginia.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to this witness at length about her sighting that happened on her way to work. In addition to what she put in the original report, I can add the following greater details from our conversation.While driving down the mountain at about 40 mph she saw a deer jump the guardrail and run across the road looking back across the road. She slowed to almost a stop anticipating another deer to cross as well. The Bigfoot stepped over the guardrail about 30 feet in front of her and looked at her stopped vehicle. She started honking her horn and flashing her lights to try to scare it. She was shaking as soon as she saw the animal. It turned and in two steps crosses the road and goes into the woods. She noticed the dark reddish-brown hair, large eyes which reflected an orangish color. She was struck by the enormous size. Her brother is 6' 7\" and a big guy but would be dwarfed by the size of this animal.The animal in no way seemed aggressive.The nearest house was about a mile awayShe has seen all types of wildlife on that road including bears and she is adamant that she knows what she saw.When she got to work she told the other workers what she had seen. She was later approached by a woman whose father is a coal miner and had apparently seen a Bigfoot in the middle of the night close to the same location about two years prior.She gets very nervous and anxious when thinking about the sighting. Now before going to bed at night she makes sure her outside lights are on and all her dogs are inside.As always, I try to figure out why the Bigfoot would be in that location. It is very remote with a lot of terrain, similar to almost everywhere in West Virginia. There are a great deal of power line right of ways in that area making travel easy and creating edge for deer. It is a hardwood forest at about 2600 feet elevation.Greenbrier County is one of the most common areas for Bigfoot sightings in West Virginia. It is a prime location and the 'Finding Bigfoot' television show did an episode in the county.",
