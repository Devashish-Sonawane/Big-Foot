I observed a creature aprox 8 foot in height in the far view of my headlights, this creature thus did cross a four lane highway in aprox 3 or 4 very fluid and unbreaking strides at a incrediably rapid pace. As I approached closer in the brief window of observation the creature thus did turn his head in my direction as he crossed the remaining distance of the highway, he also did appear to be covered with much hair. He disapeared quickly into a field of tall dry grass bordering the highway. He was moving from a northerly direction to the south towards which the Olympic Mountains border.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Very good witness, expressing shock and surprise at seeing the animal. D.W. was working at a small 24-hour store, and was a college student about 23-24 years old at the time of the event. The animal had somewhat shaggy hair and glanced at D.W. as it ran across the road. He noticed that the face was slightly lighter than the rest of the body and was flat. The arms looked proportionately longer than a human, for the same body size, maybe as far down as the knees, maybe even below. Body was more toward thin than stocky, possibly lean. It crossed Hwy 101 from the north to the south. He was traveling in his Ford Torino (a quiet car) at about 55mph. The animal was tall, with very fluid movements in its running leaps across the roadway. It ran into a dry grassland type of terrain. There was light traffic. When he got home for dinner he told his parents and his cousin about the sighting. His headlights showed the mid body better, but he noted the head appeared smaller than he would of thought for the size of the body. He noted that nothing could have stood in the road that night for more than a minute without other traffic coming and seeing it. This is what he thought it was doing, rushing across the road before other traffic got there. He knows the animal was aware that it got caught in his headlights. This took place just 1 mile west of the KOA campground, a few miles away from where Dr. Grover Krantz now lives.",
