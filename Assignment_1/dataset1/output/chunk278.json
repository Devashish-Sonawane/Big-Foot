            "Observed": "I was fishing on a wetland area that is owned by my family. My mother, grandmother, 3 yr old daughter and son were with me. This is an isolated farm that I don't want to I.D. any further online to keep lurkers off the property. It is loaded with wildlife.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke at length with the witness about the circumstances of her encounter and what she observed.  After listening to her communicate the details of her observation, I was left with the impression that she was very credible.  The witness and her family were fishing along the channel. Her daughter was crying because she had been scolded for getting too close to the water and putting herself at risk of an alligator attack.  At the time of the observation, the witness and her son were approximately 60 feet away from her crying daughter, mother, and grandmother.  The witness noticed movement in the wood line across the channel between 75\u0092 and 100\u0092 away. When she looked she observed what she first thought was a bear.  After further observation, she then realized it was something else entirely.  She had approximately 30 seconds to view the creature before it stepped out of her view.The witness described the bigfoot she observed as being \"easily taller than a six-foot man\" and likely approaching seven feet in height.  She described the creature as having very wide and broad shoulders, a big and bulky torso, and wide hips.  The witness did not notice the feet.  Its arms were long with the elbows located proportionally lower along the arms than in a human of comparable stature.  The hands were positioned close to the body and were difficult for the witness to see. The witness could not readily determine the sex of the creature as she could not identify any breasts, but she feels that it was a female based upon the width of the hips and the interest it showed in her crying daughter.  The witness described the hair of the bigfoot as appearing mottled brown running to dark brown in color and spoke of the texture appearing matted or \"knotted.\" The witness estimates that the hair length was approximately 4\u0094 long, being of uniform length on the creature\u0092s head, body, and arms.  The witness said the coloration of the creature\u0092s hair blended into the forest extremely well.  The hair around the face was a lighter brown with a tinge of gray.  She described the skin tone of the creature as a \u0093dingy\u0094 grayish brown.  The creature had hair covering its entire body and most of its face, leaving only the eyes, nose, and mouth area exposed.  The cheeks were observed to be covered in hair.  The witness described the creature\u0092s nose as being large and wide, prominent from the face as opposed to flat. The witness did not notice any ears. The eyes of the creature were very large and completely dark, with no whites or sclera observed, and possessing a humanlike mouth.  The creature had a square jawline and square facial shape.  A brow ridge was prominent on the forehead while the top of the creature\u0092s head was described as being rounded but not peaked.  The witness did not observe a chin.During the entire observation, the creature remained motionless. As conjecture, it is possible that the creature did not notice the witness as her crying daughter was at one end of the channel while the witness and her son were at the other.  The creature left once her daughter ceased crying.  The witness emphasized to me several times that at no point did she ever feel scared or threatened by the creature.  Her personal belief is that the creature was drawn to them because of the crying of her three-year-old daughter, as once her daughter stopped crying the creature moved away.  The witness described the movement as quick but not rushed, as it was out of sight in only a few steps.  The witness also reported smelling a pungent odor similar to a skunk or trash after the creature left.The witness has not had any other bigfoot sightings since this, although her son-in-law reported that he heard four distinct wood knocks coming from inside the woods on the other side of the same channel when he went to the same location to go fishing several years after the witness\u0092 sighting.  The area of the sighting is full of wildlife, with deer, hog, and smaller animals being seen on a consistent basis.The witness lives in rural southern Georgia, an agricultural area of low population density characterized by farmland, mixed deciduous forest, conifer plantations, and swamp in roughly equal measure.  Additionally, the location of the sighting is only several miles from the Banks Lake National Wildlife Refuge, a 4,049 acre National Wildlife refuge of lake, swamp, and deciduous forest.  The location is also less than eight miles each from the Alapaha and Withlacoochee Rivers, respectively 202-mile-long and a 140-mile-long north to south tributaries of the Suwannee River, each possessing floodplain greenbelts that range from 1/8 to 1 mile wide that are essentially devoid of human habitation.

            "Observed": "This is totaly unbelievable, it has happened again. I can not even believe this myself, one sighting in a lifetime is hard enough but when this thing shows itself to me again, I'm starting to think maybe it is hanging around in the same type of woodland areas that I do. I am a Pro. woodsman and most of my outdoor treks take me away from all other human interferance, another words I go where other people do not want to go or will not attempt to go. The reason for this is that in my area the public are getting more and more populated in the areas that I choose to hunt or just get away, so I travel in deeper woods and swamplands away from there interferance. Well as I said I have seen this thing again, and this time it was about 3 miles from where I had spotted it the first time during hunting season. This sighting was as though it was curious or that it was following me, staying in the shadows moving only when I moved. Although this time at first it took me by complete suprise, I remained calm and also let myself observe this thing's every noticed action, trying not to let it have any knowledge that I was watching it as well. I would move taking a slow pace for about 50 yards at a time, turn to my side and kneel down acting like I was picking at the ground. It would stop and watch me from the shadows, as I move another 50 yards and watched it, it would wait till I would get about another 50 yards then it would stop and simulate what I was doing, it would crouch down and paw at the ground where I was kneeling. It would continue to sniff at the air and try to catch scent of me. After about a hour of this cat and mouse it dissapeared. I got a real uneasy feeling when I notice it about 75 yards to my right it was flanking me. This action made me very nervous, I have seen this with coyotes tracking a wounded deer. The thought ran in my mind that it was hunting me, but this feeling passed as I kept moving on. Again it would only move when I would move, perhaps it knew that its movments would be hidden by my coinciding movements, or it was trying to get in a direction of catching my scent. I kept moving in a southeast direction, stopping every 50 yards acting like I was digging and rutting around on the ground, keeping my head down and turning looking up with my eyes and not moving my head up. I thought it was gone but noticed it behind a uprooted tree root system peeking through a hole in the roots. It was closer now and was not aware that I new its location, at only about 30 yards I could make out its eyes and the right half of its face. The eyes seemed to be the color of a whitetail deer, no whites only dark. I moved on and after about another half an hour I was getting close to a area that loggers had clear cut, and it was gone. I sat in the area for at least another hour but it did not appear to me again. While I was watching this thing I got a chance to observe it and notice a lot of its features and charicteristics. Its height is only about 6 to 6 1/2 foot, it stays in the shadows, has dark brown hair with blackish streaks almost like what you could call brindle. Walks with a hunched over ape like character. I did not notice any smell. And it made no sound. I am convinced that this is a creature that with some time I can get close enough to again. No one can tell me that this freek of nature does not exist. It has showed itself to me twice.",
