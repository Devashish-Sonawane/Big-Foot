            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness about his sighting that occurred in May 1996.  L.P. added that he witnessed a creature that looked like the sasquatch in the Patterson/Gimlin footage, moving at a pace that was faster than a man jogging, but slower than if one was running at a full sprint.  I asked the witness if it appeared to be running from something or if it may have looked as if it was chasing something. L.P. stated that it appeared to be avoiding the rain or just trying not to be spotted.  The next week he went to the area of the woods where the sighting occurred and estimated the height to be around 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 feet tall, using the trees as a reference.  He could not find any footprints due to the rain that had fallen during and after the sighting.  The wooded area has now been developed into residential dwellings, and the witness felt that this creature may have left the area due to the construction that is still ongoing.  ",

            "Observed": "I just found this website so I am going to tell you about an incident that happened several years ago. I was about 14 years old and in the Boy Scouts. My troop was from Portland, Or., and we were attending a Boy scout summer camp near Spokane somewhere....I can't remember the exact name of the camp...but it was near Spokane. The different troops lived in various campsites ringed around a lake and a main lodge. My troop had one of the furthest campsites from the lodge and the lake. During the daytime, our campsite was normally empty. For the first few days everything was fine and then things started coming up missing and evidence that someone had been going through our belongings was evident. Needless to say, one morning I woke up and felt sick. I was given permission to stay in my tent and rest while everyone else left and partook of the morning festivities. Well, I was resting in my tent and thinking about what would happen if the thing or person going through our camp showed up while I was there alone. Then in the distance I heard the voices of boys from my troop making there way back to camp. One boy was in the lead of the group and just about back into our camp when I heard him yell \"Hey, what are you doing?\" I knew I was the only person in camp and I was not visible as I was in my tent...I darted out of my tent and looked down the trail to my right and saw my troop mate...then something flashed by to my left. It was upright on two feet and all I can really say is that it was large and brown. At the edge of our camp it darted into the brush and proceeded up a small incline. Whatever it was moved with incredible speed and ease through this thick underbrush. It stopped at the crest of the hill and looked back at us....Then we being young and dumb started into the brush...and it turned and disappeared. I am not sure what I saw...I do know it was in two legs and moved quicker than any human I have ever seen, through some very, thick brush.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness is currently stationed in the U.S. army.  His incident took place when he was in the Boy Scouts, but he remembers it like it happened yesterday. He was amazed by how fast the thing moved past him and into the brush and described it as a brown blur.  The witness stated it was on two legs but it was not a man. They looked for tracks but the ground was too hard-packed. The area is dry pine forest with thick brush understory.On July 17, 2011, an email was sent to us with the following: \"The Boy Scout camp that the individual reported going to is more than likely Camp Cowles located at Diamond Lake near Newport. I attended the same camp in 1981 and it is the only one I knew of, at the time, around the Spokane area.\"We appreciate the information.",
