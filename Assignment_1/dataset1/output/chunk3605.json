I was on a gravel road that parallels M-22. I felt that something was watching me, and I thought I heard foot steps. I stopped walking, and heard nothing, so I started walking again, and stopped. Again nothing. I took one step, and stopped real fast, and heard a foot step, then another. I looked to my left rear, and saw a really big humanoid shape. It appeared to be hairy. I thought perhaps I was seeing things, so I just stared at it. finally it moved. I was so scared, I ran about three miles The other strange thing was that there was this small house with hound dogs. The dogs sounded like they were going crazy. Anyway I made it to the lighted part of the road, and stopped running. A police man stopped me, and asked if I found her. I asked him \"who\" He said there was a 13 year old girl missing from the area. I don't know if they ever found her. There was also an 80 year old woman who walked into the woods from the nursing home, and was never seen again I don't know if this is related or not, but it still freeks me out to this day.",
