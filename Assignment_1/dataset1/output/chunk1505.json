            "Observed": "I was in High School in 1986 and we just came home from an away football game and were cruising around town late one night, about 12:30 or so. My friend was driving and my other buddy was in the back seat in the middle. I was riding in the passenger seat. After riding around for a while, we decided to go to the other side of town and took a shortcut on the very curvy Timlin Hill Road. The area has some nice homes and has a huge old Montessori at the top of the hill that was abandoned by the nuns a few years earlier. So you can imaging the ghost stories that emulate from this such place. It is still well kept and was a popular make out spot for the area teens, it overlooked Portsmouth and was at the top of a hill-like region... Anyway, just at the entrance to the Montessori are well lighted street lights that provide more that ample light. We were turning a sharp corner at the bottom of the hill and started to the top of the hill toward the Montessori when we turned the corner and saw a \"thing\" sitting in the middle of the road all crouched down. When it saw our car/headlights, it arose and took three large steps and leaped over and down the hill. My friends and I said nothing until we got to the other side of the hill (stop light). I finally had to say something and turned to my friend driving and he was almost crying, my friend in the back was in total disbelief of what we had just seen. We went back (going about 100 mph) but obviously that thing had vanished. Later that night, we went back with a few more people and saw where some branches were broken. I had never been a believer in Bigfoot, but the thing I saw was something I cannot to this day explain. I was about 17 then, now I am 34 and still recall vividly how that night was when I didn't expect to encounter this thing. It was slender, tall and had fur hanging off of it, its arms swung down past its knees almost. It took two to three steps and leaped over these reeds that were at least 4 foot tall. It was almost like it was warming itself under the lights and the warmth of the pavement.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness added that it stood up from a crouch with its hands by it side. When it moved it took large steps with its arms swinging. It jumped over the reeds into the brush and was out of sight. The witness estimates that this thing was between 5' 10\" and 6' 1\" with a very skinny build. It was light grey or silver in color with white streaks. They witnessed the creature for three to five seconds.",

            "Observed": "Just last Saturday, February, 23rd, I was in Twelve Mile Swamp Conservation Area which is just north of the St. Augustine, FL Airport, bordered on the north by International Golf Parkway and running from Rte 1 on the east border to Rte 95 on the west. I had driven about 3 miles from Rte 1 west bound on International Golf Parkway to a trail entrance. I drove southward about 1.5 miles into the area then east about 1 mile when the road I was on ended at a cross road where several large pieces of logging machinery were parked. I had been knocking, hooting, whistling, talking for about 45 minutes out in the open, right in this intersection when I heard sticks breaking from something walking towards me in the woods. As it got nearer I heard several heavy, bipedal footsteps, almost stomping, coming very close to the wood line bordering the road. Then loud thrashing and intentionally loud moving about from just within the treeline, in the trees and behind 6 foot reeds/brush just on the other side of the drainage ditch between the road and woods. The noise was only 20 yards from me but I couldn't see anything as I stood on the edge of the road and peered in. Whatever it was, was very big and it sounded as if it was about to break into the open. I could not smell anything, nor had I felt I had been being watched. It approached quickly and with determination. I became nervous and walked back to my car about 50 ft. behind me. I was so sure something would break through the brush that I got in my car and turned it around for a possible quick getaway, back the way I had come. When I got out quickly and walked back to near the noise it was gone. I remained probably an hour trying to draw whatever it was back, but nothing. The reeds/brush were fairly thick but not super thick like a line of Palmetto. I was confused as to why I couldn't see anything or even brush moving. But the noise was loud and obvious and very close. Something was upset about my presence.",
