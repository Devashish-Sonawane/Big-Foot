            "Follow-Up Report": "This happened in Twelve Mile Swamp Wildlife Management Area. It is private land, managed by Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.  Access is limited to permit holders only on certain days. The witness attended a BFRO expedition in the past, and I had met him and his family on another occasion during an investigation.  He goes into the woods regularly and this is the first time he has gotten results like this.On Saturday, February 23 around 4:30, he drove down a dirt road to an area where the forest service was logging and had heavy parked equipment.  Along the road was a water-filled ditch on both sides.The witness walked down the road making lots of noise, whistling and speaking in a falsetto voice to imitate a female. From behind one of the vehicles, he heard a sound come from the woods. He stopped to listen and heard a branch snap, then another. He then heard heavy stomping bipedal footsteps that came toward him. The woods were too thick to see into. Suddenly, he saw some reeds moving about and heard thrashing. There was no wind and it was the only branches moving. It was on the other side of the ditch, approximately 20 yards away.Feeling apprehensive, he began to walk left toward his car, so did the stalker. He could hear it alongside him, and could see the branches moving along with him as he progressed. He turned his car around and sat in in for a while. After a while he got out and listened again. He stayed in the area about an hour more, all the time trying to get another reaction.  At one time he hooted twice. In return, the branches thrashed violently, and he heard a guttural growl. Before he left, he hit a tree, twice. When he did this something ran through the scrub away from him, it sounded to be 40 feet away.Much of this constitutes typical sasquatch behavior; One in which the sasquatch is attempting to scare someone away from it. He saw no people that day in the woods. There is no explanation of what else would have interacted that way in the forest with him. ",
