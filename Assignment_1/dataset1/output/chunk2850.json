There were only about eight footprints in total. We have a fence around our pond, the fence from the end of our drive is about ten, twelve yards away. The prints came from the road towards our pond, funny thing is they died out at the fence. I tried to track it but it left behind no prints that I could find after it went over our fence.The night before I found the footprints near our driveway, I heard my dog going towards the end of our drive sounding like he was wanting to attack something, I thought it was coyotes so I went outside but I didn't hear or see anything. I'm thinking this is a highway they use to move north through Crawford county IL, both sightings were in the winter months I have no idea why they would be going north in the winter time.",
