Even on a trip to mexico beach, fla. in the 80's, we saw one run across the road just before the stop sign for highway 98. We know that they are there and don't care if anybody thinks other wise..seeing is believing!!!!!!!",

The witness spoke credibly to me as she recalled the details of her sighting. The witness departed Georgia late one night, traveling to Mexico Beach, Florida.  She described encountering a strange animal squatting on the side of the road at the edge of the pavement, about one block from the intersection of County Road 386 and Florida Highway 98. The time was approximately 1 or 2 a.m.  As her car approached, the animal jumped straight up and ran from right to left, in front of her car as she drove by, and  disappeared into the woods on the other side of the road.  According to the witness, she would have hit the animal if she had been going any faster.The animal was described as about five to six feet tall, running on two legs pretty fast.  The hair was dark, long and stringy with red highlights.  The length of the animal's hair appeared to be six to eight inches, shaggy, and not uniform in appearance.  The witness does not recall seeing the animal's face.",
