            "Observed": "I'm part of a paranormal group,we were out last night, I heard 3 knocks, didn't think nothing of it at the time, thought people in the woods playing around, but my partner went to take pics in the woods, sat on a park bench, and said he heard some snorts, we thought just a deer or something. Then we sat to do an EVP session, before we started the recorders we heard something kill a deer, then it sounded so close we decided to maybe get out of there, we started to leave and got some eye shine, thought maybe coyotes, but looked at the pics, the eye shine is well over the 3 ft peas growing in the farm field, what's weird is I went out today, and there's nothing in the field disturbed, no blood, no body, no trace of anything?? I know there are no sightings this low in Wisconsin, but still kind of weird! I was thinking you might want to have someone you guys know come check it out, maybe they can find more than i did, it happened Sep. 1, 2012 about 10pm off Fitzsimmons Road in Oak Creek Wisconsin, please email me, I can meet someone and show all I know. Love the show!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The far southeast corner of Wisconsin. while quite populated, has seen an increase in the number of sightings recently.  The area where the incident in question occurred is isolated and has no light sources.  The witnesses were in the process of unpacking recording equipment to conduct an EVP session when they heard nearby snorting and what sounded like a deer being killed.  The snorting came closer, so they decided to leave the area.  As they left they saw eye shine above the agriculture growth in the field which was about three feet tall at the time. Photo taken of the eye-shine in the field:He returned the following day.  If your over the little hill in front of the pea field, you can't see the road, so if the eyes were that far back the eyes had to be up high. The tree knocks came from further to the right in this comparison photo taken during the daytime of the same field:Milwaukee County, Wisconsin is located in the far southeastern part of Wisconsin and according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,190 square miles (3,081 km\u00b2), of which 242 square miles (626 km\u00b2) is land and 948 square miles (2,456 km\u00b2) (79.70%) is water. To the east is Lake Michigan.  The area where the sighting took place is rumored to be a haunted area from the 1950's.  Its a wooded area with some upscale housing developments, and about four miles to the south are Renak-Polak Maple-Beech Woods State Natural Area, Nicholson Wildlife Refuge, and Gorney Park. Paranormal groups investigate the area, which led to the reported experience. ",

            "Observed": "It was July 5th 2015 it was late about 3:30am I had fallen asleep on my cousins sofa about 10pm after a long day at our family reunion. All of a Sudden the dogs started going crazy it woke me up so I kinda laid there thinking to myself I wish they would shut up then all of a sudden I heard one of the dogs yell out like it was hurt. Then I heard the sound of something coming up on the front porch so I sat up to look out the front window, it just so happens that we left the porch light on and what I saw was unforgettable and unbelievable. It was squatting down right in front of me I guess it was too big to stand straight up on the porch. I don't know why it was there but we had left the empty beer and soda cans and leftover food scraps in a couple of trash bags to be thrown out the next day. But to make a long story short I was no more than 8 to 10 feet away from it. I looked at for what seemed like an hour but I never saw its face because its back was to me the whole time and I never leave my 45cal but for some reason I did not have it with me. If I had you would have had a corpse to show to the world but this thing has become aggressive in this area of Alabama where my family lives. July 8th it kills my cousins bulldog, in May it chases another family member. June it looks into a family members window in broad open day time so I am trying to get some of the guys together and try and kill it because no one will do anything to research and capture this thing. We know where it lives and how it travels, all we want is for someone to capture and remove it. I live in Texas but my family lives in Alabama, and they are living in fear of this thing so it has to go one way or another",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness over the phone, later I met with several of his relatives and did video interviews.The witness had been at a family reunion, they had gathered all the trash and food scraps into trash bags on the front porch, (15\u0092 x 15\u0094x 9\u0092). The trash consisted of ribs, chicken, burgers and drink cans, etc. Around 3:30 am on July 5, 2015 the witness was sleeping on the couch, right next to the porch. His cousin \"L\" was sleeping in the bedroom down the hall from the porch. The cousin heard it coming as she had seen and heard it before. Cousin \"L\" stated she just laid quietly in her bed, thinking \"I told him about this thing and he just laughed, so who\u0092s laughing now\". She had heard it approach before and was waiting for the brothers reaction. The dog that yelped was a small dog at the back of the mobile home. Evidently it yelped when cousin \"L\" picked the dog up and put it in bed with her. (The dog being killed that was mentioned was a cousin's dog at a different location, not sure what could have killed it.)The witness stated that all the yipping little house dogs suddenly stopped their barking and went quiet. He then heard and felt the front porch groan. He sat up and cracked the blinds to see what was going on. He saw a Sasquatch come up to the porch, duck under the roof, sit down and start rummaging through the trash bags. They had left the porch light on, a 60 watt bulb, so very good visibility. As he watched this creature digging though the bags, it didn\u0092t even get up to reach other bags. The arms were thought to be 4 - 5 ft. long, the fingers were described like Snicker bars with finger nails, and the head was shaped like the back of Darth Vader\u0092s helmet. The hair was about 4 \u0096 5 inches long, the hair was colored dark brown with a hint of red. The entire back was very muscular, the feet were estimated to be at least 16 inches long, and very broad. After doing some measurements it would appear the Sasquatch was about 8 1/2 feet tall and maybe 800 lbs.  It had a very bad smell like cheese gone bad. The Sasquatch never did turn to where the witness could see the face.The witness was too scared to move, he\u0092s not sure how long the creature was there. He is sure it was at least 20 minutes. His cell phone was on a charger across the room. He didn\u0092t want to move and scare it away. When it was done it just took a leap to the ground and strode off though the yard across a 30 foot road in two strides, down a ravine and was gone.   During my visit I was shown what appears to be finger and hand prints on the trailer. The fingers start at the far left side of the trailer, with the fingers closed together, and as the Sasquatch walked toward the porch the fingers began to open until at the bedroom window it became a smudge of a hand print. The fingers and hand print were at least twice the size of mine. The hand print was smudged like it had been looking in the widow and was trying for a better grip. Photos of the prints on the trailer:There is a long history of sightings in the area. It\u0092s a sparsely populated area with just a few homes that are usually close together. There were more stories, but those witnesses couldn\u0092t make it the day I was there. Other stories from the family include a cousin being observed as he stood next to his truck on a rural road; a close encounter by two others cousins, after almost hitting one as it entered the road in front of their vehicle; and another incident involving a young family member being chased as she delivered plates of food to her grandparents who lived nearby. Regarding the wish to kill something, I explained that we have never received a report where a Bigfoot hurt anybody. That they all have their own personalities and more likely there isn't just one in the area. I suggested that they may not take lightly to one of theirs getting shot. The folks living there who had close encounters realized at how much they look like humans, and they really couldn't kill any of them.One of the children attempted to take a photo of a Sasquatch from 200 yards, here is the photo, unfortunately it is blurry and little detail is seen:There is no doubt in my mind this was a real encounter. I know the area and if I were a Sasquatch, that's where I would live. ",
