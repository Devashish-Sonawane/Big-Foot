            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and found him to be very credible, and his description of his experiences to be detailed and complete. I have the following details to add to his report:- The first animal he saw was approximately eight feet tall and was black all over. He estimates its weight at around 600 pounds. It was about three and a half feet wide at the shoulders. Its hair was short, about two to three inches in length. Its head came to a crest. He describes this animal as being massive and yet much slimmer than the other animal. Though he did not see breasts, it is his impression that this animal was a female.- The second animal was also about eight feet tall. It was about four feet wide at the shoulders. Its hair was dark red a flowed, like an Irish Setter\u0092s.  He estimates its hair to have been between four and five inches long. He did not notice a crest on this animal, instead noting that its head was more domed like a human\u0092s. He describes this animal as being very massive, especially in the chest and shoulders. His impression is that this animal was a male.- Both animals had flat faces, no obvious necks, and arms that were longer than the legs and that hung to near the knees.- Originally, the black animal was squatting and reaching up picking choke-cherries. When it noticed him, it stood up and ran with amazing speed south toward the swamp. At that point he first saw the other animal, which jumped up so fast that it tripped and almost fell, but got a foot under it.  After that it put on an amazing burst of speed and ran into the under growth following the black one. He repeatedly commented on how incredibly fast they were and how silent, even in the thick brush.- He followed them nearly to the edge of the swamp and then began to get frightened. He decided that continuing was not wise and he left the area.- The animals were about 175 feet from him.- This encounter lasted for around fifteen seconds.",

About sunrise I heard twigs snapping behind  me to my right , I was in a tree-stand overlooking a field, anticipating a deer but no deer came out but something yelled/screamed very loud that sent chills through me . What seemed like minutes probably only 30 seconds what came out of the timber that was walking upright and dark brown all over and somewhere between 6 1/2 to 7 feet tall at the edge of one timber crossing to another , probably a distance of about 20 yards between the two timbers , this thing whatever it was did not seem concerned that I was there. I have been raised in Illinois all my life hunting and out in the woods a lot and I have never seen or heard anything like this nor do I care to ever again .",
