The following may assist the reader:- The lunar eclipse occurred on November 9, 2003- After the lunar eclipse there was a bright, full moon; visibility was very good.- His friend and he constructed a lean-to type camp.- The events started to occur between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m. However, he is not sure of the time, but stated it was after the eclipse had ended.- He saw the figure (it looked like a broken off tree trunk) at a distance of 50-60 yards- The animal had paced them as he walked around the camp trying to scare it away- Several low growls were heard; Recently he has heard similar growls on the Sierra Sounds CD- At its closest point to camp, it came within 30-40 yards; it always seemed to stay just out of sight.- The animal had left once, then returned to the camp later. It was the second visit that convinced the witness and his friend to head back to the cabin. They arrived back at the cabin around 3:00 a.m.",
