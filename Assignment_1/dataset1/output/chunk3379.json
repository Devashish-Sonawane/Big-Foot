I and my brother William were out driving around the area we were vacationing in. it was a clear bright summer day in August. I was 16 years of age and my family had a red pontiac convertable so we were driving around with the top down. The location we were at was Pelican Lake Wisconsin. My relitives had a summer cottage on the lake. We decided to take a ride around the lake and got on Couny Q off of Hwy 45. This took us around the North shor of the lake. We saw a sign that led to a town called Parish. We decided to take that rode. This road as I remember was a continuation of County Q. The road was relatively strait after traveling several miles there was a very sharp turn to the right and then again very sharply to the left as though they need to avoid that section of road and could not continue with the very stait layout of the road. As my brother and myself approached the sharp jog in the road. The forest was very mature with no underbrush we were able to see clearly to the other side where the road continued. In the middle of the road walking slowly across the road was a without a doubt was a BigFoot/Sasquatch. As we approached he turned and directly look at us for several moments and then turned and moved quickly to the side of the road. We excellerated Quickly to get around the hair pin turn, when we got to the other side he/she was gone. I stopped the car and got out telling my brother who was 9 yeras old at the time, to stay in the car. I could see no trace of it as I walked up and down the road. We decided to head back to the cottage as we were both shaken.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On 2-27-2009 I spoke with \"B\" on the phone for approximately 45 minutes to an hour. Though the sighting occurred over 44 years ago, \"B\" remembers it very clearly. The following can be added to his account:- The sasquatch was approximately 8-9 feet tall, with dark brown hair. The hair was 4-5 inches in length, coarse, and shaggy in appearance. - It was built like a professional basketball player.- The facial features noted were skinny lips, and a nose that had the characteristics of both an ape and human nose. It had large nostrils. and definite nose tip.- The arms were extremely long, with the fingers reaching down to the creature's mid-calf area.- The upper legs were massive, and tapered to the lower leg.- The \"helmet-like\" appearance to the animal's head was better described as looking like someone with a hoodie on. I found this witness to be honest and credible.",

            "Observed": "I will try to make this short. I live in Illinois in a rural area, my house is set in the woods and seeing wildlife from the kitchen window is pretty standard. Its middle winter and the visibility into the woods is much better than summer. Anyway its not uncommon to get glimpses of deer running through the woods farther back in the woods at this time of year with the better visibility , although its just that glimpses. So a few days ago in the middle of the day I witnessed some deer running at a rapid pace back in the woods I wasnt able to get a good look at them , but they were running fast , like I said the visibility wasnt great , but I saw what I thought was a larger upright looking animal chasing behind the deer. I jokingly said to my mom who was trying to see what i was watching \"its a bigfoot\" not really believing that I got a  good enough look to concur it was anything. Then today my mom told me she was walking the dog in the woods and found a huge piece of poop with fur in it... I just wanted to pass this info along to you incase it interest you .. I live in gran detour illinois , I searched some sites and in the 70's there were casting of footprints made in the area...contact me with any questions",
