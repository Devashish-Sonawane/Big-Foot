I was only 9 years old at the time but still can recall the events of that day. As we were walking along the river (not really a river but more a large creek), we all came to a sudden stop when we heard this \"animal or thing\" scream so loud that it made me freeze. I look at my father to see that he had turned ash white along with his friend Chuck. My father quickly changed out his shotgun shell for a mangum load. We beat a hasty retreat out of there and called it a day.",

The area is managed by the BLM (Bureau of Land Management) to preserve a very sensitive ecosystem dominated by large cottonwood and willow trees and year round water flow. Mule deer and javelina are common here and over 350 species of birds have been identified. ",
