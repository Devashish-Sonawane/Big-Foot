She recounted the events like they were yesterday and still had emotion in her voice while talking about it. It obviously made an impression on her. She stated that she and her sister thought they were looking at a lightning struck tree stump because of the black color. The wind blew, which caused the hair to move, which caused them to realize they were looking at an animal.Upon looking closer, they could see the face which was covered in shorter hair except for the eyes and nose. The eyes were closed and it had its chin resting on its chest. It appeared to be sleeping. She described the face as ape like or human like but not resembling a bear. They quickly exited the area and rode as quickly as they could peddle back home. She described the head as conical, although not pointed.   She also spoke of her father, who she described as fearless and a combat veteran of both World War II and Korea. He was an avid hunter. She recounted him saying there were parts of the surrounding woods he would not venture into and that once he came home mystified that something had stolen a deer he shot. He shot it and found where it ran and went down, as he was an excellent tracker. He said it was like something picked it up and made off with it as all signs of the deer disappeared. He had no explanation. She stated that she listened to the Ohio Howls on the BFRO website and they were exactly what was heard around the house coming from the woods next to the cemetery at the time. She stated that it had been decades since she was in Rogers City and the wooded lot and surrounding area had probably changed greatly since then. The area is bordered on the east by Lake Huron and the north, south, and west by private and state owned forests.",
