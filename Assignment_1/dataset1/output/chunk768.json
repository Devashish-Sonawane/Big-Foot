            "Follow-Up Report": "On the afternoon of the 25th of November 2002, I talked with Bob M. about his and his girlfriend\u2019s strange sound encounter in a mountainous area of Riverside County.  Bob and his girlfriend were plenty scared, as they heard what he described as the sounds of a possible three hundred pound coyote, and the vocal and physical confrontation that he thought was taking place outside of his tent.  He then squeezed in the statement that he never left his tent until that next morning, and in so doing, when he had to take a leak, he used an inside corner of his tent.  Early that next morning Bob grabbed his buck knife and slowly exited the tent.  He did not find any blood or fur in or around his camping area as expected, but he did find some fresh, deep, and large footprint impressions in the pine needles, going down into a ravine.Bob described the footprints as being about one inch deep in pine needles and about sixteen inches long and over six inches wide, because he put his size twelve boot into the track and there was plenty of space left over.  He did not observe any toes in the tracks because of pine needles, but the prints looked to be that of a large human. Summary:  Bob was very sincere and believable as he went over his rendition of events that occurred on the outing that he and his friend had during June of 1990.  No measurements or photographs were taken of that incident.  At that time, Bob never thought that a sasquatch critter even existed.  Bob said that he had stored his excess food in his backpack about twelve feet off of the ground over a tree limb, with a rope that was tied off to the trunk of that tree.  The reason that I made this report a class \u201cB\u201d report is the fact that Bob knows the difference between bear tracks and human tracks, and he heard a large bipedal creature walking around and through their dark campsite.Bob now has in his possession a camera and a voice recorder, which he brings along when he and his family are out camping.",
