It was around ten in the evening and I was watching TV when all of a sudden some noises like that of a grunting dog came near. the living room window was wide open, and I remember being scared at the strange noises.The grunting noises came by the house and I turned in the chair and saw a large dark upright object pass by. The neighborhood dogs went wild, and a foul scent came with the creatures passing. I was extrememly agitated at the view that I got because I knew that it was not a man as it was too large, nor was it a bear because of the way it was walking.",
