The first incident was at an abandoned cabin where four friends and I hiked to one night. Three of my friends were on the porch when they ran inside screaming,\"We gotta get the hell outta here, we just saw SOMETHING\". They were frantic and when I finally got them to tell me what they saw, I didn't believe them at first. Until I saw the two \"macho\" guys about to cry. They said it was about 7' tall, dark hair and sort of hunched over. They heard it in the woods to the left and saw it run across the trail into the woods to the right. Needless to say, we got the hell out of there and never went back to the cabin at night.",
