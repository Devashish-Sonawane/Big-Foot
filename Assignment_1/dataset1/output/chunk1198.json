            "Observed": "I was working as a snowplow driver for the State of Washington and at the time I was traveling eastbound on Highway 2 towards Leavenworth.  I was approaching a train trestle, and my lights caught a large animal, on the bridge, walking towards a train tunnel.  I couldn't stop but it was clear that there was something there that wasn't there the previous 8 times I passed thru that area.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The snowplow driver was making his fourth pass over that section of the highway when he saw what he believes to be a sasquatch.  It was walking on top of the train trestle, but stopped and turned at a slight angle to look right at the driver, as if it was startled by the sound of the blade scraping the road.To assist with the description, here is a photo of the train trestle: The highway generally runs east-west, but turns at that section and runs underneath the train trestle, so the driver was headed south at the time.  The trestle runs east-west over the road, like an overpass, but unlike an overpass, trestles typically do not have side walls or rails.  The train tunnel is east of the highway.  The subject was walking toward the tunnel.A snowplow cab is up high, above a large blade, so the driver had an elevated perspective as he approached the train trestle.  He also would have had a good, close view of the subject as he drove his snowplow underneath the trestle. The driver observed it distinctly for about five seconds in his headlights, which were bright enough to cast shadows.  He estimated the height to be six and half to seven feet tall.  It was double the width of a good sized person and slightly hunched over.  He could see clumps of hair, so he described the subject as shaggy.  I was a dark brown/blackish color with streaks, making it look similar to the way some people color their hair.The snowfall at that time was very light, actually, just a little misty, the way it gets just before it stops.  He made another pass going the opposite direction through that section about 10 minutes later, but the subject was no longer there.The driver was shocked to see the subject and was glad to be inside the safety of his snowplow cab.  He didn\u0092t want to stop to check for foot prints or possibly get another look.  ",

            "Observed": "It was on thanksgiving night in 99. I was driving home from my daughters apartment in Cleveland Ga. When suddenly I thought I saw a man crossing the road on hwy. 75. I hit my brakes and realized that it was wearing no clothes and was covered in hair like a bear, but it walked upright and hunched more like a man or a huge ape like thing. It was definately not a bear. It was large and long armed. It turned it's head and looked over at me, then swiftly jumped down a huge drop and dissappeared into the woods. It all happened so fast. I was shocked and went home not sure of what i believed i had  seen at the moment. Before then I had never been sure something like that had existed and I tried to rationalize what I had seen, but now I am convinced that it was in fact neither man nor bear nor simple ape. I cannot prove what it actually was, but I can say that it was quite amazing. Either that night or the next morning I callerd Animal Control saying I saw a bear, believing that it wouldn't be taken serious if i said what i know I saw. There were cattle near by that needed protection.",
