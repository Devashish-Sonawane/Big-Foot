            "Observed": "On March 3rd, 2012 something happened to me and a buddy that we can\u0092t explain. I hadn't really thought about whether or not I believed in Bigfoot as a Biology student, but whatever this was made a believer of me. Basically, it scared the hell out of us.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness via phone, I have additional details to add to this report.The witness lives fairly close to the area where this report occurred. Being an avid backpacker, rock climber, and biology student, he is quite familiar with the area and the wildlife here. He  recalled that the first sound the two heard was as they were in route to the clearing where they planned to build the fire. They had stopped to check on one of the tires of the four-wheeler they were driving. When they stopped they were able to hear heavy footfalls approximately sixty yards away from them. Whatever was making the sound was not in their field of vision. The witness emphasized how deliberate and bipedal the footfall sounded. After checking the tire, the two men continued to their destination where they built a very large fire. The witness recalled how cold it was that night, between twenty-eight and thirty degrees. He remembered the wind howling and that storm clouds were blowing in. He believes that it either snowed or rained the day after this occurred. Even with the loud wind, the two men could hear something pacing back and forth just in the trees beyond their camp. He estimated that the pacing went on for around twenty minutes. Again he estimated whatever was pacing to be approximately sixty yards away from them. The distance it was pacing was an area approximately forty yards in width. It was at this point that he decided to make his first attempt at knocking. After the knock, the witness said he heard nothing, though his friend started to shake. His friend thought that he had heard a response and prompted the witness to knock a second time. This time he knocked three times. After approximately thirty seconds, the pair heard three distinct knocks in response. The two men began to feel somewhat nervous at that point, but decided to knock an additional three times. At this point they heard one final knock followed by a deep guttural growl. The witness emphasized that he has never heard anything like that before. He described how deep, loud, and long it was. He believed it could have lasted up to eight seconds.  The two men decided they should get on the four-wheeler and try to find the source of the growl. They drove in the general direction they believed the sound to have originated from, but never heard or saw anything else. They both began to feel uneasy, and decided to put their fire out and leave. Since that encounter, the witness has returned to the location, but only feels uneasy at night. The witness returned several days after this incident with some other individuals to \"look around.\" Close to the clearing where they had built the fire, they found a pond surrounded by a muddy bank. In the mud they found a large bare footprint. They proceeded to cast the track and the witness is not in possession of the cast. It was also noted that this track was found in a very desolate area when the weather was at or below freezing. The photo was not clear enough to add to this report unfortunately. Since this incident the witness has felt compelled to start researching other potential reports. He hopes to learn more about what happened to him that night. ",

            "Observed": "Hello, I live in Millersburg Ohio. On June 21st 2012, I was driving home from a nearby town called Loudenville on state route 39 going east toward Millersburg. West of a very small town called Nashville, on a straight away in the road, I saw something on the side of the road. I couldn't tell what it was for sure but thought it might be a man walking there. As I neared, whatever it was crossed the road (from left to right) a ways in front of me. What was weird is that I could tell it was there, but it seemed to blend into the woods, so it looked like a dark figure. It only took only three steps to cross the two lane highway. I slowed down as I passed the place it crossed and looked to my right where it had gone. By then I was almost stopped. When I looked up on the bank there was what I thought a man walking in the field...but as i looked I saw it was very big, and hairy. I thought it may be a hunter....but no clothes, no gun. I could see the hair shimmer as it walked. This thing walked like a man. It never turned around but kept on walking toward the tree line...it had hair from head to foot...it swung its right arm as it strode away and seemed to be unconcerned that I was there.  I got really scared that it might turn around so I drove away to the town of Nashville and called my son.",

She was driving and noticed something about a quarter of a mile away in her headlights.  She could not make out what it was at this point.  Her speed was about 25 mph as the figure crossed the road from left to right.  It was on the north side of the road and headed south into a wooded area. As it crossed the road she only saw its profile and stated \"It walked like a man, but it was not\". By the time she came to the crossing point she saw it from behind, it did not turn around.  It blended into the background at this point and she could only make out the legs.  Description was \"big and dark\", broad shoulders, very tall - about 7 to 8 ft, hairy and appeared to have no neck. In the light of the headlights, the closest point being about 20 feet, the hair appeared very shiny, dark brown or black in color.  She stopped her vehicle at this point, debating what it was as she watched it walk into the woods.  It took four or five steps, never looking back in the process.  The witness did a couple sketches of what she saw that night:The area is farm country with rolling hills.  Mohican State Park is to the west of this sighting with the Mohican River flowing through it.  The Woodbury Wildlife Area is to the southeast and the Kilbuck Wildlife Area to the northeast.    ",
