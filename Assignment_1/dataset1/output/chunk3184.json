            "Observed": "Me and 2 friends were walking up the gas pipeline to fish a natural spring on the mountain, now privately owned by a hunting and fishing club. As we crested our first hill, all three of us all stopped at the same time. We saw a Bigfoot about 200 ft up the pipeline. I would estimate it to be over 7ft tall, brown and very shaggy. After about 30 seconds it ran into the wood line. It covered about 30 feet in three strides and disappeared. As we got to where it was you could see four spots where the tall grass was was pushed down from its steps.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I conducted a phone interview with the witness on 5/6/2020. He stated that on a rainy and humid July day back in the 2008-2009 time frame he and his two friends went fishing on private parcel of land connected to the Sourland Mountain Preserve. This location is on the border of East Amwell Township and Hillsborough Township. While walking with his two friends in a northerly direction along a gas pipeline right of way, just as they went over a crest they saw a creature that was roughly seven feet tall and covered in shaggy brown hair, with broad shoulders, a narrow waist and long arms. The distance was approximated to be 200-300 feet. All three watched it for 20-30 seconds. It eventually moved quickly into the nearby woods just off the wide path. After the sighting the three teenagers continued towards the area where they saw it. After arriving at the spot they noticed four impressions in the tall wet grass where the Bigfoot had walked off the right of way and into the woods. They continued on their way to the pond and were nervous the entire time they were fishing. This area has a history of sightings, as investigated by this researcher.",
