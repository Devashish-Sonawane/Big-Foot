She said she had initially told her parents she had seen a bear because she could think of nothing else it could have been even though it did not look or walk like a bear. It was much later that she saw the movie \"The Legend of Boggy Creek\". She said the recreated creature in the movie was very similar to what she saw.She only saw the back of the creature, from a little below the waist up, as it was walking over a hill. \"At first I thought it was a black man, but then I saw it was hairy all over. It looked like a big, muscled up man.\"  Its black hair was \"like a gorilla\" in length. She estimated the vocalization to have lasted about three seconds, and described the sound as \"more of a growl or roar than a scream.\" The sound was of a much lower pitch than any of the vocalizations currently posted on the BFRO website. The witness still lives on the location, but has had no other personal incidents.  ",
