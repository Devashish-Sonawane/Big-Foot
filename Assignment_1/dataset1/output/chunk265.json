I thought I might of heard something close to me directly behind me so I looked back only to see the trees move like something was walking through them.This area was at the bottom of a cliff with sort of a small point along the river and I was on the tip point. The trees were mostly 30 plus foot alders and thick under brush.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with this witness over the phone. He is a life-long hunter and resident of Washington State. As a teenager, in 1981, he was camping with his grandfather and cousin near the trout hatchery on the Cowlitz River, south of Salkum. While fishing, he became aware of being watched, as did his cousin. He could actually see it in the brush behind him, but not clearly as it was behind foliage. When they turned to run away, the animal chased them. At one point, he saw a long arm come out of the brush as if it was reaching for him. It did not actually grab him. What he saw was a very long, very big, hair covered arm. It had a human look, but was far too big to be a human, in addition to being covered with short, thick, hair. He got a good enough look to know what it was he saw. Last year, on two occasions at the same area near the Cispus River, south of Randle he experienced wood knocking. On the second encounter, they felt that whatever it was wanted them to leave the area. What they experienced was commonly reported sasquatch behavior.The encounter from some time ago is about an hour away from the more recent experience.",
