            "Observed": "My son and I was driving home from the emergency room. It was late summer around 2:45 - 3:00 A.M. in the morning . On a black-top county road-two lane. in a very wooded hilly area.I was going about 35 mph. at an instant a extremely tall with it's back slightly curved foreward ,very long arms and legs,lanky bodystyle , long hair covery it's body from head to it's feet came up from side of the road .One foot hit edge of the blacktop.it took no more than two and 1/2 steps till it was on the other side of the road going into the woods. when i saw itstep out of the woods onto the edge of the blacktop i put on my brakes almost hiting it with my left front of the car .i still wonder to this day if i did not at least brush against it with my car .what was very interesting to me is all the pictures i see of bigfoot does not look like the one i saw . it did not appear as mscular... very loose in motion with it's top part of it's curved foreward.it threw it' legs very far in front of it as it took it's step across the road. Also another concern of the picture i've seen of bigfoot... is it's hair. It's hair was extremely dark not the length of a ape look but it was longer and very stringy looking. in places i would say guessing, atleast 8 to 12 inches long . This night my son and I will never forget. i have encountered bigfoot in my area several times since then.",
