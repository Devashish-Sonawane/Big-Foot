            "Observed": "I am from northern lower Michigan and two years ago was driving on I-75 just north of Wolverine, Michigan.  It was in the middle of summer and I was driving alone to see my family on Mullet Lake. In the distance I could see brake lights and was curious as to why so many cars were stopping because there is NEVER any traffic in that area.  So I stopped behind a few cars but it was visible as to what everyone was stopped for.  Ahead to my right a massive figure was stepping out of the woods and at first I thought it was a huge bear but it was walking on its hind legs.  It was covered in dark hair and was taller then any bear i have ever seen.  So then I thought it was a gorilla, because its hands were curled under as if it had been walking on them previously.  The creature crossed the highway and then proceeded into the woods on the left of me.  I thought i was dreaming, so i looked over to the car on my right and their faces were just as shocked as mine were.  I made it up to our cottage and told my family but everyone just laughed and to this day when I tell the story of how I have seen big foot nobody believes me.  But there is absolutely no way this was a bear or gorilla.   In northern michigan a bear is possible but it was walking like a human.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone about her encounter. She was driving north on I-75 just north of Wolverine when she saw the cars ahead of her hitting their brakes. As she approached the other cars, which were stopped at that point, she saw a massive upright animal walking bipedally across the highway from the east heading to the west. She described the animal as very massive, black in color with the hands curled under. She described it as at least 7 feet tall and closer to 8 feet tall. It walked rather slowly and she described it as acting confused and unsure of where to go. She could not see the face as there were three cars ahead of her stopped on the highway. She glanced over at the car next to her and saw that the occupants had a look of total shock on their faces also. She said it is doubtful that it could have been a person hoaxing, as the massive size of the animal was much larger than a person.I am very familiar with the area, as my parents have a cabin within a mile of the sighting. The area is heavily wooded with the state's only elk herd. It also is home to deer, black bear, coyotes and is the only area so far to host grey wolf packs in the Lower Peninsula. It has dense hardwoods, open fields, state planted food plots for the elk and numerous lakes and streams. The Sturgeon River runs through the area also. BFRO report #24854 was a short distance away from this sighting. The area has all the needed ingredients to support a population of sasquatch.",

            "Observed": "My friend and I were out arrowhead hunting. It was late September 1985. We were driving looking for a good spot when I spotted a ridge that was a wash out. I told her to pull over and hunt there because it was off the beaten path. I climbed to the top and spied a cornfield. So we proceeded to hunt the field. The corn stalks were small that year and you could see the whole area. In the fence row was what I thought was a black tree that was topped off.   But, I kept getting the feeling I was being watched. At closer observation of the object it was like it was grinning at me. This was in the space of a half an hour. I looked around for my friend and she was nowhere to be found. So I beat it back to her car. She was right behind me. She said, \"Did you see that?\" And I said half jokingly, \"what Bigfoot?\"",
