            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for approximately 30 min. on Dec0 31, 2005.  The witness is a forester by occupation and is very familiar with the region and habitat.  He recanted the incident with clarity and good detail.He was in his Jeep returning home from work, had just made a turn onto the road he lived on, and was traveling less than 30 mph.  His headlights revealed an upright animal standing approximately 50-75 yards in front of his car in the middle of the road.  He estimated the height at approximately 4 \u0096 4 1/2 feet, about as tall as the hood of his Jeep.  He described two impressionable observations:  First, he described the hair texture as \u0091shiny\u0092 and a \u0091greenish\u0092 tinted black color. Secondly, the standing animal briefly turned its head toward the car and then quickly took several long \u0091hopping\u0092 bipedal strides off the road and into a thick forested area. The entire sighting was less than 5 seconds in duration and weight, arm length and other body features were not recalled.Upon further questioning, the witness revealed that this road crossing sighting took place on a ridge line at the location of a deer trail crossing.  It was moving in a west to east direction.  Immediately to the west of the road is significantly lower elevation farmland, containing numerous swampy and  wetlands. Immediately to the east is heavy forest with rapidly increasing elevation toward a higher ridge.  The 'shiny' hair coat may have been due to wet hair from a brief thunderstorm that moved through the area shortly before the sighting.The witness still lives approximately 1 mile from the sighting location. He owns a private tract of land on the mountainside.He is highly familiar with the area, terrain and local wildlife, and spends a lot of time outdoors.  He has not seen or heard any unusual things in the 18 years since the sighting.  He noted that the sighting took place at a time when there was significant land development and foresting activity in the area including the construction of a nearby large reservoir.  Although there as been further development and periodic commercial foresting since the sighting, the area remains very rural and sparsely populated.This sighting took place at about 1000 ft elevation between a lower and higher mountain ridge and approximately 1 mile from the Delaware River.  This general area is located within the Valley and River. This is the physiographic province of Northwest New Jersey, characterized by numerous broad, low valleys broken by steep-sided linear ridges. The area is dominated by Kittatinny Mountain, a broad even-crested ridge about 40 miles in length and 1 to 5 miles wide, including the highest point in New Jersey at 1800 ft.  There are numerous streams, small lakes and swamps throughout the valleys. The entire region is replete with wildlife including black bears, deer, bobcats, other small game and fish.",
