Then it \"pushed off\" and the tree cracked and fell over through the fence and onto  the deck. My father did not see anything, although he kept insisting that he thought it was a \"man up in the tree,\" because of the movement that the tree was making. He wanted to  shine a flashflight up into the tree, but the incident happened too fast apparently for him to see what it was....I did the see the damage the tree made; it was quite a large tree for a coon or smaller mammal to uproot and cause it to fall- they also said that they heard the \"howling\" a couple of nights earlier. This was and has been the last time any of us has had any sounds or experiences.",
