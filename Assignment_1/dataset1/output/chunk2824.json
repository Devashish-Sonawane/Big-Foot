            "Observed": "I heard the same sounds described in the Aug 2006 report at Bear Lake.  I was camping at Spillway Campground located in Apache-Sitgreaves.  This is located close to Woods Canyon Lake. Our actual campsite was about 50 yards from the lake itself. I'm familiar with the sounds of the local wildlife, including elk and owl, and I'm fairly certain the sound was not made by these animals. These vocalizations sounded angry as well and lasted for approximately 10 minutes.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with him this evening Tuesday 11/14/06.  This is the second time he has heard this sound, the first time was in the spring of 06 at a nearby campground.  At that time the sound was faint and he didn't give it much thought.  This incident was recent, Saturday 11/4/06 at 2 am.  He was tent camping with his children, they were asleep.From the northwest direction he heard the vocalizations fairly clear but hard to judge the distance. It seemed to be from the same source.  He said it wasn't loud enough to wake anyone.  Each call lasted around 10 to 15 seconds with a 30 to 60 second pause.  Over the course of about 10 minutes he heard maybe eight very similar calls.  It was very quiet at the time but earlier there were a loud voices from other campers.He searched the internet and listened to various possible bigfoot vocalizations  He described it as a howl but more angry. He said it had a deep underlying growl to it. The other Bear Canyon Lake report is #15441. ",

We trolled quietly and slowly further back. About 100 yards before coming to some fallen trees which would have probably presented a passing. I saw no dirt embankments. Looked swampy and had more beauty and a calming effect the deeper we got until what happened. It was the last thing we expected to experience fishing.",

My husband manned the trolling motor on the front of the boat and me on the back end. Just slowly and enjoying the day and the fish that were biting and the sounds of the wildlife. We could hear the carp slapping the water surface deeper up the channel. We were there a good two hours. Husband looked up to start deeper into the channel but saw a dark, black, bulky body standing behind brush hunched over looking at us. He studied it and finally said to me \"well what the hell is that...(mumbled something).... and I asked him what/where... I saw the bushes moving slowly up into the woods as if someone/thing was fast-walking.",
