At the end of Arroyo at the time, or off a turn off, was a pumping station for the local reservoir. We parked in the street. The reason for this trip was a trek to the ruins of a former mental hospital. Unclear if there was a more direct road but Arroyo road was desolate and rarely used at that point.  We thought it would be fun and had attempted this journey before but were never successful. I was driving one of the 2 cars. It was after dark.",
