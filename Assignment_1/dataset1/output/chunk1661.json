            "Follow-Up Report": "I visited with the family and returned a few days later on a Friday evening. There was enough in their story to warrant a visit to set up recording equipment on a night the animals visited as part of a pattern. On the initial visit, I set up a game camera under an overhanging porch where strange noises had been detected late at night. The game camera recorded three images, none of any interest.The 12 year old witness showed me the exact spot where she observed the creature and talked me through its movements following discovery. She was about \u00bc mile from the family home down a long driveway and observed it moving from one tree line to another. She said when the creature noticed her; it turned in her direction and took several steps toward her. Thereupon she ran back home yelling for her mother and sister.Her mother stated that K. is not easy to scare and upon seeing her face, asked what happened. It was obvious something was very wrong as she was visibly shaking.Following the initial sighting, several things have occurred. A second sighting behind the house (away from the road) where an upright creature was seen watching the youngest child. Noises and wood knocking come from the trees south of the house.  The noises begin barely perceptible and increase in volume if no one reacts.  The family is visible to the woods through the family room windows while watching TV.  One time the adult ignored the knocking sounds and they increased in volume until one of the children listening to music with headphones could hear them.  If anyone reacts to the noises, they stop.The family owns around 50 acres in Monroe County, WV which is mostly wooded. The property has a hidden pond in the woods which is teeming with frogs. I walked around the perimeter causing dozens of frogs to leap into the water.  The family noticed dogs barking in the distance whenever the animals visted. The barking would trace the path of the animals as they approached. Dogs at one property bark until they depart, then the dogs at the next property would pick up barking.  The situation reversed as they departed. ",
