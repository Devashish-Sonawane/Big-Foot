The creature walked upright, was as tall as the average man.  When he flashed his light on it it ran up a steep embankment that was nearby.  He said he would have needed climbing gear to go up this cliff, but this creature motored up it on two legs very easily.  He did not feel like he was in any danger but he was very close to it.  I judge him reliable and he is an outdoorsman and I don't think he would confuse what he saw for local game creatures.",

            "Observed": "While doing some early season scouting for deer season in a remote part of West Branch State Park, I noticed a set of strange tracks that looked very fresh.  At first they looked human, but I thought it was odd a person would be walking barefoot it some of the nastiest deepest and thick mud slop around.  The inlet along the shores of a lake was covered with pricker bush and briars.  I followed the tracks for about 400 yards until they cut through a mud swamp.  A person would have taken the easy dry trail, these tracks went through the mud swamp.  I tried to step through the swamp but sunk over my boots.  Thats when I really looked hard at the tracks.  They were not outrageously long, I say about size 10 but the were very narrow and they sunk alot deeper in the mud than my 200 lb frame did.  The toes were very strange and appeared to be much longer than a humans, the left foot looked like it had suffered an injury to two of the interior toes.  The stride was long and I had to strech to walk the same path.  I'm six foot tall.  I circled around the swamp a caught the tracks on the other side of the swamp inlet and followed them for another 300 yards until I lost them back on dry ground where they went into the forest.",

We had no curtains on the windows and we lived in a trailer deep in the country surrounded by woods. When I looked out the window I seen a large figure looking at me through  the window. I was so scared that I was unable to speak or scream, or even move. When I finally was able to get the courage to go to my parents room I could not say a single word. I ran back to my bed and hid under the blankets until morning. The next morning I told my parents and when they looked outside there were indentations in the ground in front of the window. They then decided to look online and seen there were more sightings in the general area. They showed me a picture and asked if that was what I had seen, and it was indeed a Bigfoot.",
