            "Follow-Up Report": "The three men have told very few people.   Whatever it was looked like a human being in the distance.  Closeup, the hair made details of its face difficult to observe.  It was heavy, wide and the specimen observed by the two men appeared to have one leg dragging.  Upon approaching very close, perhaps as close as nine feet away, it turned off the trail crossed a meadow and went into heavy brush.  They did not follow.   On the phone the brother who submitted this report said to me, \" This was the most incredible thing I've ever seen in my life.\"   **Notes were made that night regarding conditions and details which are included in this report.  This was a life changing event for these men and they have been deeply interested in the subject ever since, but have not taken it upon themselves to actively investigate beyond this report, educational television programs and appropriate books.*******One other unrelated  incident about a man who had a close encounter with a female was mentioned to me.  Contact with him is unlikely, but possible.  Later in the evening the men called back and we had a three way conversation (my main informant's brother).  It was interesting as the two men hadn't talked about this in a long while.  The second brother confirmed that he too had seen something very large and hairy go off in another direction.  He also talked about experiences that he had while camping along with his father.  Seeing a silhouette outside the tent with hands in the moonlight with the fire still going.  One unusual incident included something retrieving a deer head that had just been thrown out into the swamp with the carcass.    Plans are to soon  interview the friend who was with the brother who filed this report.One of the unwritten laws in this area is you dont mess with people who are often armed.  Glimpses of whatever was in camp with them from time to time were made by the father.He spent one night in his truck because of what were described as violent screams.  He had active duty in Viet Nam and was  thoroughly at home in the woods. ",

I had grabbed my shotgun thinking it was someone trying to steal something. The dogs took off towards the edge of the river and stopped. I looked where they were looking and saw a hairy humanoid figure. There was big footprints in the snow from the pasture to the river.",
