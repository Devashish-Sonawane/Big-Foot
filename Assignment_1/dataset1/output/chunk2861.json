            "Observed": "My girlfriend and I were fishing on Glen Flint Lake in Putnam Co. IN.  I would say it was about 1 am.  We heard a coyote, or coyotes barking and making yipping noises, then we heard several loud grunt like noises, almost moan like, very loud similar to what a bear sounds like, then a coyote let out a scream like sound, like it was getting hurt.  Then it got quiet.  I pulled up our anchors, and left.  I have camped all over the United States, I've camped in remote parts of Canada.  I have never heard anything like that.  I was actually a little scared.  Whatever it was it was big.  To this day I still believe it was a bigfoot.  If I had to guess, the coyote didn't make it.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone about what he heard that night.  He decided to submit his experience after reading Report #25237, which is very near this area.  The sounds he heard occurred about 500 yards away from them.  The coyotes were yipping and barking for 30-40 seconds before the first grunt/moans were heard.  They were described as loud, and lasting about a half-second each.  These grunt/moans ended after about 15-30 seconds, and nothing else was heard. The witness stated that he has much camping experience and some encounters with bears.  He seems to think the grunt/moans are similar, but not quite identical, to what a bear can make. Glenn Flint lake is a recreational lake built in the 1970s, and is in the same area as Van Bibber lake.  This area also contains many streams and creeks. ",
