            "Observed": "This story has been told by my father, I remember him coming home as a kid an telling us his hunting stories,this story was the best, this story was never talked about again until this year when i learned about this site, I ask my father now in his late 60s about the story he told when we were kids, this happened in 1976, my father is an avid bowhunter, while leaving a deer stand and heading back to the house, he noticed a large man standing on the edge of a small  field, directly across from him. he had thought it was another hunter that hunted on the farm, my dad whistled at him to let him know he was there, there was no response, so he whistled again, no response, keep in mind this is a small winter wheat field.food plot.approx 100 yards across, my dad said he stopped and studied the figure and realized it was very tall, and it was not a man, he said his hair stood up, and he made his way to a dried up slough and headed towards the house, while navigating his way he said he could hear limbs popping behind him, when he stopped to listen it would stop, when he moved again it would move, he never seen the creature again until this year 32 years later in November 2008, while deer hunting again on the same farm, he called me and told me he seen something again, on the farm, this time he only got a glimpse of it, it was on its belly crawling up a deer trail out of a slough, he said it was black in color,and very large, he said he only got a glimpse of it and believed it to be one of the creatures. This area has very heavy jungle like foliage, if you have ever been in the river Missouri  bottoms, you know what I am describing, my dad would never tell this or report this to anyone. I have decided to do it so the info is out there.",

We were all gathered around his bike when we all heard a moan that sounded like a cross between a tornado warning siren and wolf howl. We all froze while we listened to this thing moan about 5 or 6 times. The lead rider in our group grabbed his rifle out of his case. He hikes out into these woods all the time and I've never seen him grab a weapon to defend himself against anything in these woods.",

A series of low, mournful moans were heard that lasted about 6-7 seconds each.  The moans were  very similar to the Ohio howl, but a little deeper sounding.  After the moans, the forest got really quiet. Some woodknocks were heard shortly after - there were a series of three knocks, a pause, then three more.  The group of friends started getting frightened from all this happening right by them in the forest.  They then heard something with long, heavy strides run around them, about 30-40 yards into the forest.  While the creature was running, they decided they had enough and took off out of the area.The area was described as being an old coal mining area, with lots of creeks, deer, and thick forest cover.
