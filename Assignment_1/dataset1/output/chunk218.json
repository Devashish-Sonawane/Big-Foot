Every night like clock work an airplane would be dispatched to investigate and the \"lights\" would disappear.  I observed this personally with my brother and sister-in-law and her family who camped there along with many others but do not know if it was ever reported officially because I was somewhere between 10 and 12 and at that age those things don't occur to you.  I recently asked my brother and sister-in-law if they remembered that, and they did quite vividly so I'm sure there are others out there.",

Although the area is more developed now than back when the sighting took place, there is still plenty of wildlife in the area, including black bear.In my conversation with the witness, I was told that further communication is welcome.  In addition, I anticipate some artwork that will represent the figure observed back in l981. Investigation of the details continues.",
