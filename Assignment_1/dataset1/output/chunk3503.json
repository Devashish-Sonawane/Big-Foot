            "Follow-Up Report": "The primary witness and I spoke at length via telephone about his sighting that occurred while traveling on I-79 in western Pennsylvania near the Grove City Outlet Mall.  After the sighting, the man started to research any reported Bigfoot sighting activity in the area of the outlet malls due to the location and the fact that it occurred on a major highway with heavy vehicle traffic.  The witness stated that he was certain that someone else must have also seen the creature and was looking for validation.On Saturday, August 15, the witness and his family were traveling south on I-79 to return to their home north of Pittsburgh.  He was operating the vehicle with three family members in the car when he saw a large dark bipedal creature walking along the edge of the woods on the eastern side of the interstate across the two north-bound lanes of traffic.  The figure was 15 - 20 yards outside of the woodline walking parallel to the interstate when he saw it and thought \"what is that?\"  He returned his vision to the road for a very brief moment and looked to again see the creature as it turned and was walking into the woods.  Taking the initiative to look a second time gave the witness additional mental confirmation that he did indeed see a very large bipedal subject walking along a widely traveled major roadway.  He asked his family if they saw the creature and they all replied that they had not and asked him to describe what he saw.  The family decided to travel home.  The sighting occurred at approximately 8:20 PM just before dusk.  The man stated that there was plenty of visual light to observe the creature from an approximated distance of 75 yards.  Although the sighting was visually brief, he was convinced that he had experienced a personal sighting of a Bigfoot or sasquatch.We discussed the appearance of the creature and he described the following:- An approximate height of 7' - 8'- Dark in color with hair in a length that was visible from his vantage point- The arms hung low with the hands being below the mid-thigh area- It moved with grace and seemed to have very fluid movements which surprised him for its size- He felt that a man could not move in the same way and it had great strides-He did not get a good look at the face but reported that there appeared to be leathery skin free of hair around the facial area- Did not notice anything peculiar in reference to the shape of the head or a prominent mandible or brow ridge- Subject was not as bulky or as husky as the Patterson creature- The animal had a build that was thin and lean but with noticeable musculature and strengthIn the days following the event, he began to research the subject heavily focusing on activity in the state of Pennsylvania.  The witness stated that we had wanted to return to look for physical evidence but thought that with the time and weather that had passed he would more than likely not find anything of interest.  He has discussed the sighting with his family who believe him.  When asked about his beliefs in the topic of Bigfoot prior and after the sighting, he stated that he was open-minded that they did exist but hadn't thought they were present in Pennsylvania.This witness is a clergyman with 23 years in the ministry, adding increased honesty and integrity to the sighting.  I found that the witness was genuine, forthright and genuinely interested in learning more about the Bigfoot phenomenon.  We spoke at length and I encouraged him to continue to research the subject.  I also discussed that this sighting is within three miles of BFRO Report #45958 in October of 2012 where a deer hunter had an interesting experience on PA State Game Lands # 284.",
