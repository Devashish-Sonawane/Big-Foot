Then it turned into a sort of rooster sound. The best we could guess was it was some animal like a sheep getting attacked by a mountain lion. It was dark so we sat tight in the cabin.\"Witness estimated the creature making the noise was no more than 100 yards away. \"It was very loud. It kept going on for 20 minutes. It was spooky.''A few days later, the couple found two footprints while walking near a marshy area at the foot of an avalanche chute a couple hundred feet from their cabin. They said the tracks were found in a wash that contained abundant wildlife sign.\"We call it the animal freeway, because we find deer, elk, bear and all sorts of prints out there. But nothing like this one.\"Witness said the first track, which had filled with water, appeared to be 16 to 18 inches long.Wife decribed earlier encounter (no date) with an unknown smell while taking an evening walk with a friend. \"\"My intiial thought was skunk,  but it wasn' as acrid as a skunk or sharp. It didn't burn your eyes, but it had a kind of a dirty, musky skunky smell to it.''\"Then we then we found out skunks don't live at 11,000 feet, so that made us nervous.\"  ",
