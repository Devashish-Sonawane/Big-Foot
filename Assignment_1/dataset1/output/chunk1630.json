The sun was starting to come up and the field was sunlit.  His wife was riding along as the bus monitor.  Her attention was focused on the children so she did not see it nor did he remark to her.  On the way back from town, they passed the field around 7:50 am.  The field was empty.   He described seeing two animals. The one standing was estimated to be nine feet tall, while the one squatting came up halfway to the standing animal.  Both of their backs were turned to the road, so he did not get a look at a face.  Their hair was matted brown and gray and he described them as looking \u0093nasty\u0094.  Their width was estimated at four feet.  He noticed that he could distinguish back muscles and that they looked muscular when seen from the back.  The sighting he refers to while ginseng hunting is Report #11966.",
