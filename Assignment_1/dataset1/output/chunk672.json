            "Observed": "Before the week of thanksgiving 2011 I didn\u0092t believe in Bigfoot, Sasquatch, and ape-man whatever you want to call it.  I wasn\u0092t afraid of the woods, or really ever shaken by anything until that day. My family is avid hunters and outdoors people; we are out in the woods more than most people, and not just during hunting season. We have wild hogs, coyotes, wolf, and have been told black bear even though we haven\u0092t seen them in nearly 5 years at this hunting lease. I know what big game looks like and sounds like. I have been hunting from the age of 5 years old with uncles and other family members. What I saw was not a bear, large cat, deer, and elk, any of your normal big game animals and was not a man in a ghillie suit. We have laid down very strict rules at our hunting club to which I had a helping hand to write, because me and my husband are land managers. Although ghillie suits are not banned, just expressed that misidentification could get you shot while wearing one, and you have to wear blaze orange during deer season period while walking to and from your stand. If you are going to stalk hunt you have to wear blaze orange at all times and stay in the area you have been assigned to period. If caught without blaze orange you are permanently banned from the club, due to insurance purposes. I only tell you this so you know that it wasn\u0092t someone just pulling a trick on me.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I conducted a telephone interview to verify the above facts as reported. She was still quite shaken by the event and, as of the interview time, had yet to tell her husband or any other hunting members about the encounter. She did feel that her uncle would be especially receptive based on his prior experiences on the property.  Initially, she expressed a great deal of anxiety related to returning to the property in the near future.  After discussing the events for more than two hours, she seemed determined to learn more about Bigfoot behavior and the history of sightings in the area. She was educated on the numerous resources available online including our database. I hope to learn more about the immediate area in the near future.I was able to obtain the following additional information:The animal was observed crossing an opening approximately 400-425 yards wide in a very short period of time; she estimated it took \u0093less than a minute\u0094 and that it was moving from left to right and slightly away from her. Her only observation of facial features was fleeting as it turned to look at her. \"He had a dark, leathery face and dark eyes\". She perceived it to have a purposeful gate with a long, steady stride. It did not seem to be frightened or hurried, but focused. This speed is remarkable if her estimate is accurate, putting its pace near a four minute mile without much of an effort.Her ATV\u0092s untimely failure was due to a fuel line coming off. In her anxious state, she was not able to identify the problem and focused only on her attempts to remove herself from the immediate area ASAP. The 3-shots she fired is a well-established practice to summon aid from anyone within range. The hunt was scheduled for one more day but she chose not to participate for fear of seeing the animal again.The older gentleman she referred to (her uncle) was frequently the brunt of many jokes while on the property due to his belief in Bigfoot. He would often mention things on the property that he felt were related to possible Bigfoot activity. When pressed for examples, she remembered him mentioning that the cleaning area where the game animals are gutted would frequently be completely cleared the day following a kill. She explained that she had actually seen the place he described as a \u0093bedding area\u0094 where they observed several areas in the grass to be twirled around in tight circles as if someone had sat down and played with it. This older member of the hunting group had hunted the land for several years more than anyone else. She speculated that he may have actually had an encounter himself, but would not want to draw that type of attention to himself. Three National Forests surround the lease comprising some 725,000 acres.  Nearby Toledo Bend Lake is the fifth largest man-made lake in the United States at 181,000 acres and some 1,200 miles of shoreline.  In fact, the vast majority of southeast Texas is largely unspoiled.",

            "Observed": "While predator calling this date, I was targeting bobcats with an electronic call. (I mention this because with this particular call, only a bobcat would be expected to respond. A fox, coyote, coon, etc. would not respond to this call.) After about 10 minutes of calling, I heard a sound from behind me that I could not identify. I was using a varmint light, which has a red filter. This light is not normally readily seen by predators. I shined the light toward the sound, and saw what I thought was a bear. It was dark in color, but everything was either light or dark because of the red filter. I have hunted in the West several times, and seen many bears. I initially thought that's what this was. But as stated earlier, a predator does not respond (normally) to this light. But this animal did. It stood up and moved away very rapidly on it's two \"hind\" legs. While on all fours, it appeared to be a bear. Upright, it appeared to be around 5-foot tall with a fairly large stride. I wasn't able to notice any other details because of the light source and because of how quickly it moved off. Bears do not move great distances on their hind legs, and especially not rapidly. It made this sound continuously as it moved away, gradually decreasing in volume until I couldn't hear it any longer.  I'm not sure what this was, but I'm quite certain what it was not, and it was not a bear, a hog, or any other animal native to this area. After a recent conversation with Daryl Colyer, he and Craig Woolheater encouraged me to make this report. I did not do so earlier because I simply had no idea there was a possiblilty this could have been a bigfoot-type animal. Should there be any follow-up, I'd like to request Daryl Colyer as the investigator.",

The witness is still perplexed about what he and his wife actually encountered in 2004. He is an experienced outdoorsman and is quite knowledgeable of known, indigenous wildlife. The witness did not realize until my conversation with him that primates would be able to see his \"varmint light\" with its red filter. The light is normally used by those who hunt at night because it protects natural night vision and because it seemingly has no effect on non-primate predators and the like. So, until our conversation, the witness was quite puzzled why the animal seemed so disturbed when he illuminated it with the red light. I explained to the witness that the type of behavior that he described as being exhibited by the animal seemed to fit the profile of how a nocturnal primate such as a sasquatch might react to a light that was even filtered with a red lens.The witness knows what it wasn't, but he is still not able to come to terms with the possibility that what he saw was a sasquatch, although all other indigenous animals fall outside the physical and behavioral profile. The witness and I will meet in the very near future at the site of the encounter. I will post any updates as warranted. ",
