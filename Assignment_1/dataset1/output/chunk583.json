            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to witness via phone for around an hour. The witness is now an adult but at the time the first event occurred in 2009 he was a 17 year old high school student.It was just after sunset in the summer and the parents of the witness were having a loud party outside in their backyard. So to get away he and a friend decided to head out and take a walk to the backside of the neighborhood along a creek in the woods. It was bright outside and almost at full moon. They had traveled only about 100 \u0096 160 yards into the tree line and could still see very well. Witness stated that as they were walking he kept noticing very faint sounds of movement in the woods directly behind them.  Upon noticing this they would stop and at the same time the movement would stop.  As they continued they then had to cross over a fence which lead onto some private property. They traveled for a few more yards into the woods. This is where the witness noticed a figure approximately 50 yards up ahead of them situated in the palmettos among a clump of oak trees. His first reaction was to tell his friend to stop, get down and be still. As they watched and waited the figure never moved again so the boys stood up. As they stood up they then saw the figure also stand up and very quickly move behind a nearby tree. Witness stated it appeared very large and very wide and was approximately 8 to 9 feet tall but moved smoothly and quickly on two legs. They froze and waited for it to come out behind the tree.As they stood there frozen they then heard more footsteps behind them in some nearby pepper trees. At this point the friend was frightened and immediately took off toward the house.The witness not wanting to be left alone also turned to run. As he was fleeing he turned to look back and saw what appeared to be a very large person following behind him pushing its way through the pepper trees. He thought this very odd as pepper trees are very thick and they seemed to be parted very easily and quickly by whatever was pursuing him. As he reached the fence and cleared it he heard a very loud but low pitched gurgling exhale. Witness stated he had never heard this type of animal noise before. Regarding the second incident. Having grown up in this rural area the witness is very familiar with the outdoors and has been a hunter from an early age. He is a very proficient wild boar hunter and is used to the sounds and signs of wild boar among other animals found in this area. He is very sure that he was not chased by a boar and that it was unlike anything that he has ever encountered before. ",

Were were hunting a remote Texas Ranch at night with no light with the exception of a motion activated green light that would shine if an animal walked within 10 yards and 145 degree radius of the light standing 3 feet on a stick in the ground.  We were placed onto our milk carton \"chairs\" behind dead vegetation about 2 feet high and 40 yards from the light placed over a pile of corn placed by the rancher.  We sat down just before dark at 9PM and waited. I wore binoculars and glassed our area before dark to become familiar with the terrain and where the pigs might trail to the corn.  At 200 yards behind us in a brush area, I noted an animal lying down and looking towards us.  It was only a quartering appearance, but I noticed it was eating something.  I could not identify the animal, only movement and a dark hairy head.",
