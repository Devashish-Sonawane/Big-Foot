She said it stood like a human and she could see its hands.Also, its face was very very dark.   She also mentioned when it stepped and disappeared it turned sideways and she thought maybe there was a chance she would see a snout (maybe indicating a bear)  but she did not.  At first she thought it was strange how it disappeared so fast, but  after watching wildlife she noticed the same ability with deer.   In other words, wild creatures can disappear quickly into the vegetation  and this observation was a good example of that.    I inquired about its body build and she thought it had a medium, not thin or heavy build and that it was evenly built that way throughout its body.  She felt it was some sort of primate and made it clear she could not see the feet as they  were in vegetation.Her observation was less than a minute long.    She also mentioned that some of the stories she had heard Native Americans tell included that sometimes during a rain people would enter a cave to stay dry and these creatures would be inside and just turn their backsides to them.  The area she made the observation  at was not far from the Illinois River and the terrain there certainly provides ample cover for any shy elusive species.  ",
