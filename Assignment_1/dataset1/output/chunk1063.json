            "Observed": "My girlfriend and I were parking at the edge of a creek flowing into the back of the lake. It was dark and under the cover of trees where we were parked you could not see your hand in front of your face. We had the windows cracked little and were in the back seat of the car when we heard something out of the ordinary. We had been there before so knew the usual night sounds in the area. A owl lived in the big tree near by and hooted all the time. The hill in front of the car went down to a swamp with a creek in the middle going to the lake. There was crickets, frogs and locust all making there normal sounds that night. But we heard something coming through the leaves in the bottoms, it sounded like it was heading to our car. I have spent a lot of time in the woods hunting, fishing and trapping growing up so I don't get spooked to easy. At first I thought it was a cow, but then we noticed all the night sounds were gone, no frogs, crickets, owl - dead quiet except the foot steps. They were on 2 feet a step and a drag step like it had a hurt foot or something. Then being a kid I thought of all the horror movies I watched and figured it was a guy who jumped the train and was coming to kill us and take our car. As the steps got closer I got really bugged, it was coming up the hill right at the car. Finally after what I thought was an eternity I flew over the front seat and started the car, the only problem was it was a new car she just bought and I never drove it. She was screaming about dieing or something when I threw it in reverse and stomped the gas. I was there before and new the road opened up behind me so as I was going backwards I hit the light switch. This was a big mistake because it turned out to be the cigarette lighter, as soon as we came out of the tree cover we got some moonlight and I found the headlight switch.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken at length with the witness on numerous occasions and consider him to be among the most credible of witnesses. There are no additional details to add to the report.It seems in the 1970's and into the 1980's, the Cross Timbers Region of Northwest Texas had a number of bigfoot encounters. There are still occasional sightings in the general area of the northern section of the Brazos River from Johnson and Hood counties northwestward and in the general area of Possum Kingdom Lake into Parker, Palo Pinto and Jack counties. BFRO and TBRC researchers are planning more extensive research in the area (Jack County, Parker County, Palo Pinto County) at some point in the near future. ",
