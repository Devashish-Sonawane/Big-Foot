            "Follow-Up Report": "I emailed Daniel Reed and received a response from him. I had to interview Daniel via the phone (4-19-2018) because he has moved to northern Ohio since the report. Daniel stated that the incident occurred in May of 1988. He was leading a platoon of ROTC members from Cedarville College on a night-op mission at Peterson Park, located on Rte. 42. They had hiked to the park where they were to engage in war games with another platoon. At a place where there is an upper trail and a lower trail near a waterfall, something was dropping rocks on them from above. He said that he sent part of his group up from the right and part from the left while he went up the middle. When they got to the upper trail, nothing could be found. They returned to the lower trail and again the same thing happened with same result. On their way up the trail, through the park, part of his platoon heard branches breaking and thought they were \u0093under attack\u0094 from the opposing platoon. They reported finding branches broken at about 7 foot-high and a dinky fire in the middle of the trail made of paper and small twigs. They thought this was very strange as it was raining. The night was very quiet and eerie. They didn\u0092t think it felt right. They returned to the campus and found that due to the rain, the opposing platoon had never left the campus. Daniel stated that about a year later, a friend reported being on top of the Indian Mound located in the park, at night, and heard a strange moaning coming from the bottom of the mound and then the moaning started coming from the opposite side. A friend and I went to the park on 10-07-2018. It was a nice warm day and there were multiple groups of people hiking in the park. Massie\u0092s Creek flows through the park which is heavily forested with high rock ledges. There are waterfalls and multiple hiking trails and a large Indian mound located in a clearing. We found no obvious sign of bigfoot activity. The park was being heavily used the day we were there. I found no physical evidence at the time, but later found a short video on YouTube of a young lady walking her dog near the Indian mound when the dog stopped, alerted, started growling and retreated back to its owner.

The witness was in the doctor's office, looking out the window to the north, toward the mouth of Chloe Creek, and the rock cliff that overlooks the town of Pikeville. He said that the creature walked slumped over, with the arms reaching mid shin. The hair was reddish brown, like that of a brown bear. He described it as very \"ape like\" in appearance, thin and lanky. Seen from the distance of about 100 yards, he could not remember being able to make out facial features. He said that it was not broad shouldered as most sightings describe, but very tall, between 6-8 feet. He was stunned by the sighting, not believing it could be a sasquatch. He had not heard of any other sightings in the area. A self-described skeptic, he had told very few people about it, and still has problems rationalizing what he saw that day. I was impressed by his honesty. He has been an outdoor type of person his whole life, and is sure that what he saw was not a bear, as it was walking on 2 legs the whole time. Asked if it could have been anything other than a sasquatch, his simple answer was \"no\".",
