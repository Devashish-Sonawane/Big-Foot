            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on January 08, 2006, for more than forty minutes. He and his wife were returning from a trip to Florence, Alabama and they were watching the sun set as they drove along the Natchez Trace Parkway in a generally southwesterly direction. They had just crossed the Mississippi-Alabama state line and had traveled approximately three to four miles into Mississippi as they approached mile marker 307. The witness said he saw what initially appeared to be a person jogging along the right side of the road in a southwesterly direction. He emphasized that it\u0092s fairly common to see joggers along the Trace, so he didn\u0092t think much about it at first glance.The witness said that when approaching mile marker 307 the road is hilly that there's a slight downhill incline at that point. At the bottom of the hill, the road curves to the right when traveling southwest on the Trace. There was a vehicle approaching in the opposite direction that was just entering the witness's field of vision as he topped the hill just prior to mile marker 307. The vehicle traveling in the opposite direction had also just topped a hill as well. As both vehicles came into view of each other on tops of their respective hills,  the animal appeared to panic. Both cars traveled down their hills, around the curve, and passed each other. The witness slowed to \"nearly a stop\" while the other car appeared to pass by without slowing. The animal was initially traveling at a \u0093normal speed\u0094 for a jogger when he first noticed it, but then it suddenly started moving quickly and appeared to be running at \u0093about the speed a deer would sprint\u0094 as both vehicles entered the curve.As it crossed the road from right to left, it lost its balance and tripped, nearly falling down. After catching its balance, it \u0093bounded off into the woods\u0094. It had its back towards the him until it turned to cross the road. The closest he came to it was roughly twenty-five to thirty yards. It ran between the two cars and roughly equidistant between the cars. It was solid black and was illuminated by the sun, which was still in the sky. He said the entire observation lasted \u0093a matter of seconds\u0094 and his full attention was focused on it for about two seconds. It happened so quickly that he didn\u0092t even have time to say \u0093look!\u0094 to his wife who was in the car with him. He thinks the sighting took place within the bounds of Tishomingo State Park.He emphasized that he didn\u0092t pay much attention to it until it panicked and started moving very quickly. He got a side profile of it as it crossed. He said its head \u0093didn\u0092t look human\u0094 and appeared to be \u0093a little raised in the back and it appeared to slope towards the front\u0094. He described it as \u0093very stocky with a muscular build\u0094. When it tripped, it swung its arms out to catch its balance. He said the hands appeared to be much larger, proportionally than a human\u0092s and the arms appeared to be longer, proportionally, than a normal human\u0092s arms. While the animal was running along the parkway the arms were \u0093up like a human\u0094 -- like a human\u0092s arms would be while jogging. -------------------------------------------------------The surrounding terrain is steep hills and large boulders. Bear Creek runs through there. An area adjacent to this location is called the Freedom Hills. It's called Freedom Hills because it was a favored hiding area for escaped slaves prior to the Civil War.",
