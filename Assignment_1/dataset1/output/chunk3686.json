            "Observed": "My husband, my brother-in-law, and I were riding down towards the Miss. river about 8:30 p.m. that night. We were in a car, my husband was driving and I was sitting in the middle, my brother-in-law sitting beside the passanger door. As we were going down Hwy.88 I saw a creature that was about 7 foot tall,and weighed about 245 lb. It was completly but lightly covered with dark brown (black) long hair. As we were riding and our car lights hit it, I saw it on the right side of the road. It stood there for a moment observing the oncoming car. I stared at it, and it stared back at me for a brief moment. As I was looking at its eyes, I noticed a reddish tint. His features reminded me of a cross between ape and man. It was standing upright on two feet. And like a human it ran across the road. The speed with which it ran across, was unlike any I have ever known. I asked my brother-in-law if he had seen it? He said he saw something cross the road, but it was so fast he thought it was maybe a deer. He couldn't say for sure what it was, because he was carring on a conversation with my husband. Still to this day I will not go down there after dark. ( February 11, 2000 )",

There had not been any rain in the area for some time so that most of the grass had dried out, dry grass cuts down on ticks & chiggers. There was about an 8th inch of dust over the hard tack in the exposed areas. There was also a small pond about 40 yards down slope between our camp site & the lake shore. This I belive this had once been a stock tank. The open end of the lean-to was facing the lake shore so as to get the breeze from the lake. The other end (foot) faced a dirt road that was about 300 yards up grade.",
