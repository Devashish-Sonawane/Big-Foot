            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness for 45 minutes and was surprised by her incredibly clear recall of an event that occurred nearly 17 years ago. The sighting probably happened between Salyer and Willow Creek on Highway 299. The creature entered the roadway from the driver\u0092s side and crossed in three casual, unhurried strides. It stepped first with the right foot and, as it took its second step with the left foot, it slightly turned its waist, a little more of the shoulders and then a pronounced turn of a visible neck to look at them.Witness was a straight A student and has an incredible memory. She said it looked almost exactly like a cross of the stills of the Patterson-Gimlin film and the life-size re-creation of Gigantopithecus with the man in glasses standing next to it in Los Angeles. If you're familiar with the photos of the Giganto, she said the arms were exactly like that and the coloring and hair length is spot on. The entire body was covered in hair/fur, with it being much thicker and longer on the head, beard, neck, arms and shoulders and shorter on the chest, back, and legs. The only place with no hair was the eye sockets, which were recessed under a heavy simian brow. The hair was shaggy and darker on the chest and face with a rusty hue while the arms were lighter, kind of a dirty blonde. The nose was somewhat small and very human looking. The hands were also extremely human looking with the palms facing inwards and the thumbs sticking out at approximately a 70 degree angle while the fingers were extended. She has since looked at various primates in several zoos and none had hands that looked as human as this creature\u0092s. It stepped with the left leg and arm swinging in perfect synchronicity forward and the same with the right arm and leg, as opposed to humans who step left foot right arm simultaneously - very fluid and unhurried. She got the feeling that this creature was very accustomed to humans and had a very confident look about itself, not surprised or scared. The witness was certain it was an adult male of at least eight feet in height. While the legs were long, the chest was proportionally longer and very robust and blocky with no discernible waist. It was also slightly hunched forward at the waist.",
