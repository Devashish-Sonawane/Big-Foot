The first time my cousin and I were riding my minibike through a new subdivision just north of the manchac swamp in tangipohoa parish in Louisiana, we saw something about 500 yards away lumbering towards us.  It was upright, black, and hairy.  I pointed it out to my cousin and we agreed to turn back.  We stop a little was while backtracking and looked back and the \"thing\" was lumbering a little faster towards us in the middle of the road.  I accelerated and my cousin fell off.  I stopped, he jumped back on and yelled to go.  We never looked back and never told anyone for many years.  About a month later the same cousin and I were in the woods behind the same subdivision (it was behind our farm)and were returning from the bayou when, along a train a bush shook and a big hairy arm potruted out, grabs some leaves and went back in.  It was late in the day and the light was fading so we couldn't see into the bush.  We ran the entire 1/4 mile home-full speed.  It was the last time my cousin entered the woods again.  I still haven't learned my lesson.",

Zion Church entryway. Visitors have to cross a low water bridge on Sugar Creek at this point. Was a very pleasant day in May (31st), with blue skies and a light breeze. After about a half an hour we heard what could only be described as the most unholy sound any of us have ever heard coming from the area past the fallen tree on Sugar Creek (about 1000yds away from us). It was no cow, donkey, horse, etc. My wife and best friend heard this sound and in fact captured it on our camcorder. It is nowhere as loud as it was in person, but I do have it recorded.",
