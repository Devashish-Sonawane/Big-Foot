We had been in a an area of mountainous/hilly forest close to road. The country started to open up with some farmland. My wife dozed and I was rather lost in thought. I diverted my sight to about 30 degrees to the right and was startled to see something that got my attention and kept my attention until about 60 degrees to the right. It passed quickly out of view because of the speed of the vehicle and a bank and some foliage obscuring the view.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The eastbound and westbound lanes on this section of highway are separated by a forested medium. The medium is wide enough so that drivers in the eastbound and westbound lanes can not see each other.Official sunset for that date was 7:16 pm. Even though the sighting occurred almost four hours prior to sunset, the lighting conditions were described as \"grey\" because of the prevailing weather conditions.The creature was initially spotted roughly 200 yds. away at about the 1 o'clock position in the witness's field of view. The sighting lasted until the creature (stationary during the entire time) passed into the 2 o'clock position and a bank along the highway rose up and concealed the witness's view of the creature. The witness estimates the distance to the creature to have been 150' at the last point of the sighting.In the brief time that the witness saw the creature he was able to make a quick assessment of the following details:- Smooth, even colored hair, estimated to    have been 3-4\" in length- Rounded but not very broad shoulders- Upward sloping skull- No visible neck- Arms relaxed at side of creatureAfter speaking with the witness by telephone, I found him to be very credible and was especially impressed with his ability as an observer. Taking into account how brief his sighting was, he was still able to garner a lot of detail about it. I contribute this to his extensive experience as a pilot which has trained him to make fast, accurate, decisions and observations.[Note by Matt Moneymaker]When I lived in Ohio in the mid-1990's I remember some Ohio researchers talking about Clearfield County, Pennsylvania. They said it was a special place.  The Ohio researchers thought there may be a high concentration (relatively speaking) of sasquatches in that county, because there were said to be many old farmers there who had sighting stories of their own, and knew of many other stories from their parents and grandparents.  The presence of these animals was supposedly common knowledge among the farmers there, but had been documented only sparsely. Route 80 is one of the main East-West routes across PA. It goes through miles of impressive mountains and forests. In several portions the off-ramps are 20+ miles apart.  The first time I saw a mountain lion in the U.S. was in Pennsylvania while driving on Route 80 back to Ohio from New York.  It didn't look like an escaped pet mountain lion ... It looked pretty wild, stalking on the edge of a clear cut near the highway, unbothered by the passing traffic.",
