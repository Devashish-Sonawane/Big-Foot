            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness at length. She has a history of being in the outdoors and is originally from Minnesota. She used to deer hunt in the past and is comfortable in the outdoors. In addition to what she originally posted I can add the following.The house that she is living in was empty for about one year. They had been inhabiting the house for about 6 weeks at the time of the incident. It is typical to the Hocking Hills area, meaning that there are fields backing up to considerable areas of rugged forest.The dog with her was an Australian Shepherd which alerted when she went outside. That was what made her look up. She estimates the animal to be 8-9 feet tall and was at a distance of about 125 yards. The branch that the animal pulled down was about 8 feet long and 6 inches in diameter.When questioned she said that she has noticed a lot of knocking noises in the woods behind their house. They have a pen in the back that they take the puppies out to occasionally. They put dog food and peanut butter for training out there. She noticed that the gate has been untied before and a musky type odor in the pen.The Hocking Hills region of Ohio has been an up and coming area for sightings. If there is a bigfoot in the area it could have been in the woods surrounding the vacant house. The whole area is loaded with deer. I'm sure that a bigfoot's curiosity would be heightened by a new woman living in a previously unoccupied house and a litter full of Whippet puppies.",

            "Observed": "While training at Ft Carson, I was on patrol with a Marine Recon Agressor Force, agressing fire batteries in simulated attacks.  My patrol attacked the HQ company, and during the withdrawal, I was separated from my unit.  There was plenty of ambient light, and I could see my unit across the field and hear them calling for me.  They took off, and I figured I could cut through a wooded area and intercept them.  As I rounded a bend in the trail, a figure stepped out into the trail in front me.  It was about 6.5 feet tall, covered in light brown fur, had large fox-like ears, and large, black, globe-shaped eyes.  The nostrils were slitted and large, without much nasal definition.  The body was muscular, with a thin waist and easily discernible definition, and the arms were long, hanging below the level of the hips.  The creature stepped out into the trail, looking in the opposite direction, and I had stopped stock-still the moment I saw it.  It turned and saw me, at which it exhibited a startle reflex,then immediately crouched down and slowly moved sideways off the trail, watching me the entire time.  It knelt behind a bush, at which point it became very hard to see.",
