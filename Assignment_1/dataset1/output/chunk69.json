I have walked those woods since I was 4 years old and I\u0092m now 61 \u0096 I know the deer, moose , bear and other wildlife of those woods.  I built my camp on Spectacle Pond in Osborn in 1988.  I have spent a lot of time in the years since exploring the woods and waters around the camp over the years and know the area between Route 179 and Route 193 better than most and within 10 miles of my camp, better than anyone.  Since 2008 when I retired from the U.S. Navy, I have spent one month every year at my camp \u0096 2 weeks in May, fishing and 2 weeks in November, hunting.  I have spent many days and nights in the most remote areas of that part of Maine.",
