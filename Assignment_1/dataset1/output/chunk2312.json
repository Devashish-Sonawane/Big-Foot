            "Observed": "It was back in probably the early 1970's, Spring time, late at night (around midnight).  I was out riding down this road that had a farm on one side and an apple orchard on the other.  As I was driving there was some movement about two hundred yards in front of me going across the roadway from the farm to the orchard.  When the object got to the middle of the road it turned its head and looked in my direction, at this time I got a real good look at it, about 8 to 9 feet tall very heavy build, long lanky arms, long dark red hair, very long stride (about two and a half steps to cross road).  If I was to guess his weight, it would have been around 4 to 5 hundred pounds.  I was on a road with very little traffic (I was the only vehicle on the road at that time).  I got to admit, I was not a bigfoot believer until that night.  I didn't tell anyone about this because I knew they would not believe me.  I was one of the chief officers in our local fire department at the time and I didn't want people to think I was nuts.  Oh by the way, I did get close enough to see what it was or wasn't.  I know I was shaken up a bit and did not travel that road for a long time afterwards.",

Additional facts :The sighting took place at approximately 2:00AM.The hair on the animal was a somewhat uniform length. He estimated it to be six inches long or so. It had a reddish/brown color.When the animal looked in the direction of the witness, the eyes had a glare from the headlights of his vehicle.His impression was that it was a male.The witness just kept driving because he was surprised at what he saw. This was the only encounter he ever had.",

With numerous rock quarries used to create the logging roads, at times the shooters make the canyons sound like a war zone. But as soon as playtime is over and evening sets in, people head back down the hill and the war zone transforms into a more serene and mysterious place. Booms and blasts are replaced with the sounds of the wind blowing through the firs, birds chirping and camp conversations. When night falls, another reality becomes quickly apparent. This area has one of the highest instances of Sasquatch encounters in the country.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I was present for this encounter and can attest to its accuracy. I interviewed each of the four witnesses, and we decided for the  witness who filed this report to be the spokesperson for the event. We carefully planned this outing and spent a couple nights prior in a campsite approximately 1/2 mile as the crow flies from the location of the encounter.While audio recording equipment was malfunctioning during this outing, there was a subsequent trip to the exact same position during the following week where audio was obtained. Those clips can be heard here:(headphones recommended, start with volume low, then increase as needed)clip 1    clip 2    clip 3    clip 4The clips were recorded with a Sony M10, and edited from the original source file, with no processing or alteration of the source audio signal with the exception of \"clip 1,\" which received a 5 db gain using Audacity.Also collected from the site were the the following photos:This image is a stick, leaning against the base of a large Douglas Fir that is in the direction from where the knocking sounds emanated -  approximately 100 yards into the treeline. Access to this location is very difficult on foot due to numerous felled logs, thick brush, and a very steep incline, and took myself and our team approximately 15 minutes to get to the site. The stick was found as depicted, stuck in the duff. The long stick to the left is my 54\" walking stick.This image is a close up of the \"knocking stick\" end, found shoved down into the duff adjacent to the tree:All images and audio were collected under my supervision, and I can attest to the veracity and accuracy of the evidence as such. This area has become an ongoing study site, and further updates to this report will be submitted accordingly.Based on the collected evidence and witness testimony, there is a strong possibility that the witness(es) encountered a Sasquatch demonstrating \"tree knock\" behavior in this remote Oregon wood.",
