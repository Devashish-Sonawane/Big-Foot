            "Observed": "My wife and I traveled from our home in the Dallas area for a 5 day trip to Hochatown, OK on Oct 26, 2020. It had rained all day and had gone to drizzle by the time we arrived at our cabin around 4:30 pm. We unlocked the cabin and went inside and looked around and then went out right before 5 to start unloading our SUV. My wife grabbed some items and headed inside. Right as she got inside I heard a siren go off in the area of Beavers Bend State Park to warn about water being released from the dam. Immediately I heard a load deep growl. After a few seconds the growl turned into a deep howl. This went on for about thirty seconds and was immediately followed by a loud high pitched scream. This was followed wooooing sounds that lasted about 2 minutes. My wife came out while this was going on. We didn't discuss it as I didn't want to tell her what all I had heard. We grabbed up some items and went into the cabin. Upon coming back outside the sound was gone. I heard the siren go off many more times while we were there but never heard any other sounds. I am an army veteran and also former scoutmaster and have spent a lot of time in the woods but have never heard a combination of sounds like this. I'm still not certain if this actually was one or a coincidence of several animal calls occurring one after the other. My wife thought the woooing sound was wind blowing in the forest when we discussed this after we got home. But at the time there was little to no wind blowing and we never heard that again although it blew quite a bit as it rained the majority of time we were there. I originally sent this sound combination to Cliff Barackman and mentioned the Ohio howl and after looking it up it did sound similar to that. At the time I hadn't really thought much about Bigfoot since back when I was in junior high in the 1970's but after this have become really interested in it after this.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness was contacted and this is the result of the conversation. As he mentioned he and his wife had arrived at their cabin for the weekend. As he was unloading the car the sirens went off at the campsite to warn off anyone near the dam as they released water. As his wife went into the cabin with a load of luggage, the sirens went off. A second or two after the sirens began, he heard a growl that seemed to have come from near the entrance to the property, and the low growl turned into a long continuous howl, and it slowly modulated into a longer piercing scream. At that point it then morphed into a long wooing calls that lasted at least 2 minutes. He described the scream as a woman screaming at the top of her lungs.As all that was going on his wife came out and heard the wooing and he said nothing, acting like nothing was out of the ordinary. He knew it was out of place and didn't want to alarm her. When they got inside the cabin she brought it up and she thought that it was odd, but concluded it must have been the wind. He left it at that.The rest of his dialogue is accurate and he did look up Sasquatch sounds to see what it may have been and the similarities were striking to him.As a note, the area they were in is a vast area of rivers and forests. I have heard the same calls when they hit the sirens at fish hatcheries and dams/spillways. Once while scouting a location for a BFRO expedition near a fish hatchery, the sirens went off at 6pm. I was sitting at a picnic table going over notes, and before the sirens were done, a long high pitched moan/howl came from a bluff overlooking my location. It oscillated to a higher pitch, then stopped shortly after the sirens stopped. Very similar to a dog howling as a fire trucks goes by with sirens blasting. Good casual report and witness. ",

            "Observed": "My wife and I started to make our descent from the summit of Mount Greylock during a morning hike.  Approximately half a mile on the Cheshire Harbor Trail, close to Rockwell Rd, my wife and I heard a clapping sound.  We stood in place for a few moments, listening to the sound.  The \"clapping\" was non-rhythmic, sometimes there was one or two, other times there were many \"claps\".  In between the \"claps\" there was sounds of something walking, breaking fallen branches as it moved.  The sounds were about a distance of 100 feet from our position on the trail, within a thicker patch of woods.  We listened for almost a full minute and then decided to continue on the trail, moving closer to the source of the sound.  When we reached the area where we believed the clapping sound to be coming from we listened again and heard nothing and had seen no movement.  Further down the trail I attempted figure out the sound.  I did some tree knocking and banged rocks together, but only when I clapped my hands did it most closely match the sound my wife and I had heard.  It was a sound that I have never heard before and it has sparked my interest into figuring out what animal made this noise.",
