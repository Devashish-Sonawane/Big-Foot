The dogs were chasing something, but he couldn't tell what. Once they cornered the creature in a large thicket, the hunter caught up with them on the four wheeler. About the time he was ready to come to a stop, the dogs ran past him going the opposite way, tails between their legs and yelping. The hunter immediately followed the dogs and refused to hunt in the area after that.",

Although he only saw the creature from a distance, it would would be suicide for someone dressed in black to be walking through the woods during hunting season. During the interview the witness added that it seemed as if the creature had a purpose in coming out into the field and crossing in front of the large oak tree, rather than just wandering about.This area is very close to the Blackwater River State Forest. It is a very large wilderness area that has many creeks, thick vegetation, ample wildlife, many food sources and several different types of habitat.There have been a number of reports out of this area throughout the years. Many of the old-timers in this area refer to the creature as the Blackwater Booger.",
