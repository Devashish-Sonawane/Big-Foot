            "Observed.1  ": "   Stan Gordon    By John Jennings MANAGING EDITOR Friday, January 23, 2004  Bigfoot sightings were big once again in the Chestnut Ridge area in 2003, according to the annual roundup of the unexplained from word processor of Stan Gordon. The \"X-Files\" may come and go, but Greensburg-based Gordon has maintained an A to Z compendium of mysteries for lo these many years.  Derry Township has become the hairy heart of Bigfoot sightings in recent months, including one dated Aug. 15, when a woman in a heavily wooded area walked out to her garden to pick lettuce for lunch. Instead of produce, she received a shock to see a \"huge manlike creature with dark hair and long arms,\" leaning against a tree only eight feet away, and looking curiously at her.  When Gordon says huge, he's not whistling in the dark. The creature's head, according to the witness, was scraping a branch that was later measured at 96 inches--eight feet--off the ground. Gordon searched the area and found some older footprints, about 15 inches long, in the area.  That sighting occured only a few miles from another Bigfoot visit, also in Derry Township. This one came April 13, when three witnesses observed a tall beige-colored creature with long arms swinging, walking through a cornfield. (Bigfoot has been called many things, but never before \"beige.\")  Shortly thereafter, Gordon received a call from a man who said he was on a motorbike with his son on a rural road around the Westmoreland/Fayette county border. They said \"a hairy manlike creature, with arms hanging down to around the knees\" (Bigfoot definitely would have trouble buying long-sleeve shirts) jumped out of the woods and stared at them from 75 feet away, then ran back out of sight.  But the best, most intriguing Bigfoot sightings of recent months dates from September 2002, also in Derry Township.  This was actually two sightings in a remote part of Derry Township, the first by a teenage boy, the second by his mother.  In the first instance, the boy heard crashing sounds in the woods, then saw a \"big brown\" creature, about eight feet tall.  A couple weeks later the boy's mother was driving and talking on her cell phone when the creature reappeared.  What was most impressive, and athletic, about this sighting was that the woman claimed the creature stepped--not jumped, stepped--over a barbed wire fence 44 inches off the ground without even breaking stride.  And of course there were other oddities to report, although UFO sightings were rather sparse in 2003.  In February, a woman driving between Latrobe and Greensburg reported seeing a large dull-gray square object with a light on each corner and a red light on a domed top hovering low above a field.  She approached within 200 feet of the object and stopped her car to get a better look at it. \"Suddenly, it just vanished,\" she said.  Strange sounds--a whoosh with no whooser--were reported in March and April in both Westmoreland and Indiana counties.  Several people, unknown to each other, called Gordon and said they heard something that sounded like something big climbing into the sky, like a large gust of wind, but nothing was seen.  One man said he had the sensation of something big climbing overhead, moving fast. The sound was so intense, Gordon said, that he ducked his head, but nothing was seen.  Sounds like the Klingons have perfected their cloaking device.  And finally, in June from Everson, outside of Scottdale, several boys playing in the afternoon said they observed a heart-shaped greenish object falling straight down from the sky. As they watched, a probe came down from the base of the object. The object hovered at treetop level, then climbed straight up and was lost from sight.  Gordon deliberately tries to debunk the calls he receives, including Bigfoot sightings, to separate the trash from the intriguing. \"Some Bigfoot sightings were only misidentifications of a bear or large dog,\" he said--\"but some cases aren't so easily dismissed and remain in the unidentified files.\"  To report a strange sighting, call Gordon at 724-838-7768 or e-mail at paufo@westol.com. All information is kept confidential. Gordon has been doing this since 1969, and now speaks to groups on his findings.

            "Observed.1  ": "\"That bridge was built for horse and buggies, not concrete trucks,\" Wayne Bell, TxDOT area engineer, said. It will take two to three months to replace the bridge, commonly known as the 1893 bridge. For now that section of Survey Road, where the 75-foot bridge provided crossing in northeastern Cooke County, is closed. \"It's a looped road so they're not locked in,\" Bell said about residents who live there. An estimated $200,000 grant obtained by Cooke County Precinct 1 Commissioner Phil Young allowed for the removal and replacement of the historic bridge, Betty Henderson, Callisburg Park Board member said. \"We would not have this if Phil Young had not gotten the grant,\" she said. The 1893 bridge is one of the four oldest in the state, Henderson said. Local officials also wanted to keep it because of its history, which includes ghost and Big Foot stories as well as its age. Lara Teed, TxDOT bridge project manager, said the Pratt Through Truss bridge with timber decks was built in Chicago by the Chicago Bridge Company before it was moved to Cooke County. There it remained until Wednesday. By 9:30 a.m. workers had rigged the bridge and by 10:30 a.m. they had lifted it, Teed said. Then for the next six hours the movers took the bridge slowly around corners and under power lines until reaching Parkhill Park. \"It was absolutely amazing,\" Teed said. As it was moved 10 miles from its work place of many years, parts of vines that had attached itself through the years to its steel rails waved in the breeze, as well as a sheet tied there to give it a ghostly atmosphere. Given the bridge's history, Bell said they decided to leave the sheet ghost there for its move. Callisburg High School student Jon Eric Pharr is one who will miss the bridge in its old location. \"It used to be the main thing to do,\" he said Wednesday morning. \"We would take people there to scare them.\" He said teachers at Callisburg High School would tell the students convincing stories of Big Foot living in the creek bottom and woods surrounding the bridge. \"Sometimes we would walk down in the creek at night,\" he said. \"We would take girls down there and have friends who would hide there to scare them.\" Pharr sometimes they would prep the scene beforehand like leaving a supposedly bloody shirt on the bridge. Other times a driver would stop in the middle of the bridge and turn off the car, then pretend it had trouble starting. \"It would get everybody freaking out,\" he said. While the bridge, once refurbished, will provide passage over another creek, to Pharr it won't be the same because it won't be in the same spooky area. \"We'll all miss it,\" he said. \"It was fun to go down there and have good fun scaring people.\"",
