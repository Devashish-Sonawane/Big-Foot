            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness in a phone interview and can include additional information.  The witness is a life long resident of the area.  He is familiar with all types of wildlife and admitted he knows well the sounds a Sasquatch will make as he has heard them all his life.  According to the witness, they have always been in this area.  He reported that when he was young he and his family knew they were around his homestead by the watermelons they would take, and by the remnants they would leave behind.  The witness also commented that as a teenager, he and his friends would take their dates over to Fouke, AR to the house from The Legend of Boggy Creek for some scary fun.  The witness said he had never felt any reason to be concerned until his hunting experience. The witness had hunted this area before but this was the first time that he felt it was made clear to him that he was not welcome to be hunting in that area.  The day of our conversation, the witness said he decided to \"man up\" and return to that area and said he was rewarded by getting a deer earlier that morning.  Like most witnesses and hunters, he confided that he had been ridiculed for his belief and therefore rarely discusses the subject.  He contacted BFRO because he felt like we would want to know.  I thanked the witness for his report and he said he appreciated the opportunity to discuss the subject credibly.   I found the witness to be candid and credible as well.   ",

We were sitting around the fire. I had just stoked the fire and added some more wood. That is when we heard something walking toward us in the woods. After it came to the road, it continued through the middle of the campsite, which led to the river,  and then the other way into the woods. The animal ran down towards the water then turned around, ran back up the road and into the woods. At this time it went on the back side of the campsite.  My friend and I were shocked, we thought it might be a bigfoot but decided to go hunting. Once we got out of the stand we went to go investgate what had happened, and that is when we saw the footprints left in the sand. The foot prints were proably 16\" long and far too wide to be human.  There were five toes.",
