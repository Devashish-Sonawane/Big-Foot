            "Observed": "My wife and I were walking down the Great Dismal Trail which is the old Route 17 before they made a 4 lane version between Chesapeake VA and the North Carolina border. We had walked approximately 1 mile down the road and were sitting at one of the benches they put along the way. It was quiet and cool out, around 50 degrees. We started hearing what sounded like someone walking parallel to the canal on the other side. We heard the typical crunching sounds of leaves and twigs snapping. These sounded like the footsteps of a man (as in 2 legged). They started to our right as we faced the canal and in the span of about 5 minutes ended up being in front of us. Once the were near our center, we started hearing steps coming from the left side. We continued to listen as they seemed to be intercepting each other. A couple minutes later we heard what sounded like chattering or popping sounds from the center point and then the same sounds coming from our left. My wife and I were somewhat spooked at this point as we've never heard those sorts of sounds before. I was carrying a small, thick pine branch which I hit against a mile marker post a couple times to try to produce some sort of a response. About 10-15 seconds later we heard a similar sound come from the area of the footsteps but it seemed like it was deeper in the woods. The steps continued and it sounded like it was about to pop out on the other side of the canal. The canal is approximately 40-50 feet across and very deep at that point and the brush on the other side was essentially a wall as it's so dense. We never did see anything but I decided it was time to leave. My wife was hesitant as she wanted to see what it was. We headed back to the gate of the trail and there was a park ranger sitting in his vehicle waiting to close the gates (the trail closes at sunset which is 5:00pm at this time of the year). There's frequent blackbear sightings in this area so I asked the guy how bears typically sound in the wild. I told him about the chattering and asked if they could do that but he didn't think they produced that sort of sound. We talked a bit longer and started towards the car. About 20 feet from the car my wife and I heard a loud but short scream coming from the direction of the swamp. The best we can describe it is a cross between a woop and a woman's scream. My wife thought it was my cars alarm sounding but I said it doesn't make that sound when unlocking the door. I have absolutely no idea what we heard but it was completely unlike anything she or I had heard before.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke 45 minutes with witness who seems very credible, and is familiar with local wildlife and has hunted outdoors in the region. The following details can be added from our conversation:- The witness is a amateur photographer and on that day was enjoying the scenery and listening to the sounds of nature with his wife.  - He had the impression that the footsteps were careful in placement, not wanting to make too much noise, distinctly bipedal, and something large by the sound of the crunching leaves.  - Before the footsteps merged was when the popping/clicking sounds began, and he notes two distinct sets of these sounds, coming from slightly different directions in front of them, as if communication was taking place between the sound sources. The sounds from the two locations were of similar pitch, without much variance, and lasted about 15-30 seconds.  He likens the noises to a jaw click or pop that sometimes occurs when chewing. He admits that it could have been rocks being hit together, but does not think that was the case.- As the witness and his wife headed back to the trail entrance, they kept stopping to see if they still heard the footsteps, and one set of footsteps seemed to be keeping up with their progress along the trail.  At this point they hastened their pace back to the entrance, never again stopping. ",

            "Observed": "While driving from Richmond, VA to Charleston, WV, on I-64, I saw what I assumed was a deer run into heavy east-bound traffic. One vehicle had to brake hard to avoid hitting this thing. When it came out between the cars and hit the grassy 70ft. median, it was running like a sprinter runs. I thought \"That's not a deer, it's a man\". He never slowed down when he got to the west-bound lanes and ran right behind a car passing an empty log truck. He almost ran into the rear of the truck, so he stopped. At this time I saw that he was covered from the top of his head to the ground with long dark brown hair. As soon as the truck passed, he sprinted across the lane and into the woods. The middle of his shoulder was even with the bottom of the cradle on the log trailer. When I passed this point, my 30yr. old son saw him running up the hill through the woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the father the same day we received his report. I initially had hoped to drive to the spot on I-64 but that day we had a severe winter storm which blanketed all of West Virginia in large amounts of snow. The witness is a retired gentleman and his son who also witnessed the bigfoot is 30 years old.  This witness and I talked on the phone for about 45 minutes about his sighting and I found him to be a kind and amiable man.In addition to what the witness initially added I can add the following. The area where the sighting took place has no immediate houses around. There were no vehicles parked anywhere on the side of the road. There were woods on both sides of the interstate at this point.The sighting took place at 5:05 pm. It was just starting to get dusk. As the animal crossed the median he noticed that the arms were long and that its posture was bent forward and shoulders hunched forward.When he initially saw the animal they were about 200 yards away coming toward it. They were very close when the animal was forced to stop for the logging truck and he noted the hair color and length to be similar to an auburn colored golden retriever. They were close enough to see the hair \"set down\" when the creature stopped. Being able to compare the height of the animal to the logging truck, the father believed it was 6 - 6 1/2 feet tall.I also talked to the 30 year old son who was in the passenger seat. He told me that he had heard of bigfoot before but did not know that they were in West Virginia. At the closest point he was about 50 feet from the animal as he was looking out the passenger window as the animal climbed the hill after crossing the interstate. He stated \"I know what I saw and it was not a person\".I have been in this area many times and have taken another report within 5 miles of this location about a year ago. I was on a private expedition with several other investigators very close to this location last spring. It is within 5 miles or so of the Monogahela National Forest. The area of the sighting is significantly lower in elevation than the surrounding mountains which may mean less severe winter weather. There is also a lot of farm silage in the area which could be a winter food source. I have no obvious reason why the bigfoot chose this spot to cross. We receive numerous reports of sasquatches crossing roads under all types of conditions. Greenbrier County is an area rich in beautiful countryside, remote wilderness, and an abundance of caves. I have included satellite imagery of the location.",
