The fur reminded her of an old matted fur coat at first, until she saw that it was all over it's legs and head. The body was about medium build in her estimate.It walked very non-chalant, not in a hurry. It was too dark to make out any facial features, but it did look at her momentarily, then slightly turned away from her, although she was only a street width away from it, she got a very good look at the rest of it. It was very tall (6 1/2 to 7 feet in her estimation), and very dark colored. She kept on driving by, not stopping to investigate. She said she often thinks about it, like it just happened yesterday.",
