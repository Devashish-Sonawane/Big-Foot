            "Observed": "I recently moved into this house in May of 2004 and when exploring found different animal trails. Thinking they were deer, I occasionally follow them. After seeing that deer like to feed in the lawn area, I started putting apples and other fruit out for them. Within the last couple of months I have heard some things at night and when I checked I never saw anything but I always would smell a strong musky odor. The dog would go out barking; I knew he would come back in smelling like a skunk. He always came right back without a smell. When he went out chasing deer, he would always stay out for some time. I started to put fruit out on the table by the house. In the morning it was gone. A couple of nights ago I awoke with the motion sensor light coming on. I smelled that smell but by the time I got to my feet to look out the window all I saw was something large and dark walking on two legs, heading back into the trees. Unfortunately, the creature had moved into the shadows. The ground is solid so I have not been able to see tracks of anything, not even the deer that I do see crossing the property. I smell him almost nightly and continue to try to get a better look at him.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The location is just south of Grants Pass at the edge of the Applegate River and the Siskiyou Mountains and National Forest. The witness and visiting friends have experienced thrown objects, intense odors and the feeling of being observed. In addition, rabbit food is regularly removed from a covered garbage can (with the lid returned roughly into place). A rabbit was removed from its pen without any damage to the door and pets have shown signs of anxiety and fear. There have been other suspicious events not attributable to human activity, especially given an observant and protective dog on the premises. The chickens that disappeared were free ranging, flying and roosting in trees. Therefore the possibility they fell prey to raptors cannot be eliminated. On one occasion, the witness saw the sasquatch standing next to a camper cover with its arm draped on the camper\u0092s roof, which is about 6 feet off the ground.",
