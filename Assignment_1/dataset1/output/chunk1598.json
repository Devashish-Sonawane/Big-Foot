We had just crested a hill and I observed in the distance 1/2 mile ahead what appeared to be a dark upright figure walking along the north (right) side of the road on the gravel shoulder heading west up hill.  I thought it was unusual, someone would be walking along the road in this area. As I mentioned to my kids (daughter age 6 / son age 7) \"What is that?\" the figure glanced back our direction and began running, continuing west along the side of the road for a short distance, then it crossed the dividing line and continued uphill at a fast pace in the opposite lane. It then left the road going left/south up a short tractor access road and disappeared into a cornfield/wooded area. We were approx 100 yards away from it when we lost sight. At the closer distance it appeared overall dark and shaggy. My first impression was someone wearing a gillie suit. My son witnessed it.  My daughter sitting behind me in the truck did not.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness and gathered additional detail.  With the witness' descriptions, I was able to make two satellite image maps showing locations and travel directions.  I've also driven this route since the report was filed and was able to validate the witness' description of the terrain, distances and lines of sight.The witness recounted his experience to me with additional detail:The sighting happened at 11:47 am in broad daylight on a partly cloudy day on Tuesday, July 23, 2013 after we picked up my daughter from camp. This was only my second time traveling in this area.  The first was on the prior Sunday afternoon when we dropped her off at camp near the Des Moines River on L Ave.  I was able to use Google Earth to pinpoint the area this happened:  42\u00b0 6'26.10\"N lat  94\u00b0 0'59.02\"W long.  We were on 170th [aka E26] heading west toward H Ave [aka P70] in order to pass through Ogden and catch Hwy 169 south towards home.  We crested a small hill and started down into a small valley.  I noticed in the distance an upright, dark colored figure walking west on the right-side gravel shoulder. I thought it strange someone would be walking this time of day not really close to any farm and dressed head to toe in dark bulky clothing.  Then it appeared to take notice of our car and took off running on the shoulder. I've hunted for the last 30 years or so in Iowa and it was not like anything I've seen before, upright bipedal.  Even in the distance I could see the arm swing. It cut left across the center line and continued on the road uphill for a short distance in the oncoming traffic lane before exiting the road, heading south/left into or behind the woods. We were less than 100 yards from the figure when I lost sight. I slowed down in the spot it exited but didn't see anything in the brush.  With it moving and the distance it was hard to form any sort of reference to tell how big is was.The questions / thoughts that went through my mind at the time were: If it was a human, why run?  Was it someone up to no good and didn't want to get caught?  Also, running uphill into the oncoming traffic lane was not very safe.  Deer usually don't spook at that distance.  Was it Law Enforcement?  Was it someone out early scouting deer dressed in camo or a ghillie suit?The short driveway / tractor access road didn't show any signs of vehicle traffic.  I thought maybe this was someone trying to make it back to their parked vehicle in a hurry.  I cannot definitely say what I saw, but I know a lot of things it wasn't.*****Investigator: This area has a history of sightings and related Class B phenomena.  Two weeks after this sighting, a group of campers four miles to the east in the same river greenbelt had a series of encounters over three separate nights.  See BFRO Report #41845 .",
