            "Follow-Up Report": "This subdivision is only partially developed and is an older community.  No outside traffic and very quiet at night. Each evening he walked his dog in this vacant part of the subdivision, but this night while trying to get his dog to do her business, he walked about 50 feet more than normal.  His somewhat aggressive dog, a female American Bulldog/Greyhound mix, first brought his attention to the figure when she bolted to the left. They were walking on the right side of the road and the figure was on the left, only a 10 - 15 feet distance between them.  He immediately knew that this huge figure, resembling that of a football player geared up and crouched a bit, was out of place and did not belong there. It was around Halloween time, and his first thought was that he was \"being hoaxed.\"  As he described, he called out, stating he had a firearm, and would not hesitate to shoot it. This figure did not have a normal reaction to this threat, this is when he really became scared.Aiming the flashlight on the figure, yellow/green eyes shine back. Being very dark out, especially in this part of the subdivision with no lights, he could not see the object clearly, but stated he knew it was covered in hair. He did not know the color and did not care to guess. The witness call outs some more as he is pulling his dog and backing up. As the witness backs away with the dog growling, the figure slowly stood, turned, and walked behind the trees.He describes the figure as an \"ape man\" and \"boxy\" and says if one were to draw it, it would look like a large rectangle from the shoulders down.  When first observed, he would estimate height at 5'8\", and when it stood up - 8 feet tall.He believes there was no chance it could have been a hoax, as the figure should have heard his warnings and did not react like a human would.  Due to the size and bipedal walking, he also believes it was not a misidentification. Well aware of the local wildlife, he is adamant that this was not a bear on two legs.  Being a hunter all his life, in addition to working paper routes in the dark when he was young, he does not get scared easily.  The subdivision, located only a 1/4 mile from the Ocala National Forest, has fruit trees and wildlife including armadillos, racoons and deer. Not to mention the garbage cans that are collected twice a week.  There is a rich history of Sasquatch related sightings and reports in this area. ",
