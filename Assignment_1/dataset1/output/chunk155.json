            "Observed": "My wife, daughter, son, and I were fishing at a lake near Guthrie Oklahoma.  It was the end of May and we decided to do some night fishing but arrived well before dark.  We got our poles in the water and were enjoying being outdoors when some doves started calling back and forth.  Our daughter began imitating the calls and did a fairly good job of it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness, whom I will call Howard, at length over the phone.  It was an enjoyable and enlightening conversation.  And despite the fact that this incident happened almost 16 years ago, time has not changed the feelings and emotions for him, his wife and their daughter.At the time, he was still active duty military.  And therefore he, rightly, viewed himself as being a pretty tough guy that was not easily frightened.  There were four of them fishing.  He, his wife, their daughter and their son.  He had scouted the area previously to get an idea where they wanted to bank fish.  They were fishing for catfish on the lake.  As it got darker, they moved to the other side of the boat ramp as there was a street light near there so they could have more light.  There were a few doves in the area and their daughter was calling to them.  She has a very accomplished singing voice and hits notes perfectly.  Even back then, she was very good and mimicked them well.  As it got later, their son headed to the truck to sleep.  The others kept fishing.  They had caught a few small fish which they threw back and some keepers which he had on a string in the lake.   The way they were positioned on the lake was in a small cove with water in front and to their left.  There is thick cover to their right, and if navigated properly, one could stay in thick cover for several miles in an Easterly and Southeasterly direction.They began hearing a couple of owls hooting back and forth to each other.  I questioned him more thoroughly on this point, and he stated that he does believe they were owls.  The family also commented to each other how loud the frogs and the insects were.  The daughter began mimicking the owls as well.   An owl then swooped in on them from the cover to the right.  They heard it do this.  I have had an owl swoop in on me as well and you don\u0092t hear them until they are right on top of you and they flap their wings to get away.  This is what Howard described.Immediately after the owl, there was a loud roar from the cover and exactly where the owl had come from.  And at the sound of the roar, the entire area went dead silent.  No frogs or insects for a minute or two.  Then they restarted a few at a time until it was back to the original level.   Howard has spent time in jungles and other various locals.  He has heard howler monkeys.  The closest thing he could remotely compare it to was the roar of a lion.  But it was deeper, and longer.  He stated it rattled his chest.  He said that whatever it was had massive lung capacity.  His daughter and wife recall being \u0093freaked out\u0094 and terrified by the roar.  He, however, being active military, was trying to remain calm and rational.  He said they stayed just a bit longer, and then they left.  They took the larger fish off the stringer and released them back into the lake as well.  Ever since then, he has done his best to evaluate the incident and come up with a \u0093rational\u0094 explanation.  Or at least one that does not end up with a sasquatch.  Each time, he keeps coming back to that conclusion.  He has listened to audio and he has not heard the same sound. It was not a howl or a whoop.  It was a roar.  He, like so many other witnesses, still can\u0092t really come to grips with what he heard, but it has definitely piqued his interest in the subject.   ",
