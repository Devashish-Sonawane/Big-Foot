            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness's first encounter occurred near one of the tributaries that feeds the Lewis River. He and some friends hiked into the area on a game trail after midnight. They then followed the trail along the river until it reached an area where the river forked. At this point they were approximately 2 miles from camp. They carried no lights except for head lamps. One of the men in the group had a slingshot, so they used that to shoot rocks into the river.Not long after they had been shooting rocks into the river, a member of the group said he felt \u0093an unusual vibration in the ground.\u0094 The vibration was not an earthquake and it was unusual enough that he became frightened and wanted return to camp.As they hiked back to camp, the witness said the vibrations continued and the vibrations seemed to follow them for \u0093a while.\u0094 When they got back to camp, their girlfriends asked if they had been throwing rocks into the camp. The women said the rock throwing occurred not long before the men returned to camp, yet the witness said that to his knowledge nobody in the group threw rocks anywhere near the camp. The wind was behind them as they hiked back and he said they were downwind of the area from which the women said the rocks had come. Nobody in either group smelled anything out of the ordinary.The witness said the vocalization was high-pitched and comparable in some ways to a cougar, but distinct. I asked him if it reminded him of a woman screaming and he replied that\u0092s what it sounded like.The witnesses heard the vocalization twice. It was 3 to 4 seconds the first time and \u0093a little bit longer,\u0094 the second time. He is insistent that it was not a cougar or a coyote. He says he has heard cougars, as well as \u0093lions [cougars] in heat,\u0094 and he\u0092s certain that the two sounds he heard were not cougar. I asked him if the noises he heard could have been two animals answering each other. His impression was that the vocalizations were from the same animal both times.A similar vocalization woke his girlfriend around 5 in the morning. She said the vocalizations seemed to be \u0093very close.\u0094 She was the only one who heard this set of vocalizations as everyone else in the group was sound asleep.The witness closed by saying, \u0093I know what I heard that night and I\u0092m not crazy.\u0094 He said when the group got home after camping they found the BFRO web site. When they listenned to the various recordings in the Recording Section (click here), his and his girlfriend\u0092s hair \u0093stood on end.\u0094",
