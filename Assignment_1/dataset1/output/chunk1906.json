He had never experienced an animal reacting to his presence with so little concern. It seemed to be absolutely unafraid of him and observed his fishing for quite some time. The animal departed into what he described as the thickest brush you could imagine. It moved through the tangle rapidly and with very little noise. He did not hear any subsequent noise from the direction the creature went. He reported of hearing wood knocks and howling on previous visits. Similiar incidents have previously been reported from the same recreation area.",

On this Summer day, my friend and I had just cross a creek and we were riding the bottom of a ridge. It is a game trail. I was the lead ride and my German Shepard was om my heels, with my friend behind me. In the distance approximately 120 yards, I saw first what i thought was a bear foraging ...It saw me and took off on two feet straight up this ridge. My dog went after it and she was gone for a half an hour. I could not ride my horse where I believe what I saw was a Sasquach. I took another game trail and galloped to the top and into a wheat field. I called and called for my dog and she did return, pretty tired. My friend never saw anything. This event happened so fast, in a blink of an eye. It was dark blackish and I have to believe it was young, not broad just stocky. Reading report 395 put my incident just south of Touge road and Hwy 219. It is the the thick timber stands above the hay fields.",
