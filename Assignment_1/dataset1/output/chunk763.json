The prints are very uncommon as they depict a very heavy body making prints with no visible \u0093arch\u0094, which is a commonality in Sasquatch prints. Report #12098 contains the photo she compared these prints to. Also as noted, there is a picture showing a clear mid-tarsal break, with the mud being pinched by the prints' compression of the mud substrate, see photos:Also noted the was the lack of campers coming out or going in and only one small camping group who was present on the other side of the lake when they arrived. Some of the prints are 4\u0094 or less and very wide for a normal child's foot print. Pictured is the witness\u0092 footprint which is 7\u0094:The prints were found in the fall and lead from the lake to a gravely portion of the surrounding hillside and then up a steep incline into the wilderness where no trails were present.  See photos:Upon finding the prints, she attempted to stomp on the hard mud surface and was unable to impact the mud to the depth that the prints were left. The witness took this photo with her foot pictured against a wide and flat 4\" print:This is a noted area where possible Sasquatch activity has occurred.",
