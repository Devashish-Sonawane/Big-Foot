            "Observed": "It was the summer of 1977 and I was 18. My father and I were traveling across country as a graduation present. We camped off old logging roads and the like.  We were camped on July 10, 1977 off an old road near Quakertown Pennsylvania. After we got our campsite set up I went for a walk to have a cigarette (I went alone because my dad didn't know I smoked, or so I thought).  It was about 3pm and a bright sunny day. I was near a dried up river bed when I saw something move out of the corner of my eye. When I looked to my right across the other side of the river or creek bed I saw a large beigy or light brown hair covered man-like animal. It was crouching or sitting, I couldn't tell. It made no eye contact, but I knew it was moving out of sight because of me.  It just slowly ambled into the bushes and out of view. I was scared to death. I ran back to where my dad was and he followed me back to the site where I saw \"it\".  He noted a deep depression in the land where it had been crouching or laying and he said the hair on the back of his neck raised up. But there was no further sign of the animal.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "In talking with the witness she stated that calling it \"man-like\" in the report was wrong, and that \"ape-like\" would be a better description, as it was very definitely \"apey\".  She also stated that the hair was a light brown almost blonde, and was 5-6 inches long.  The creature was in a crouched position and facing more or less toward her, but the face was angled away enough that she could not tell if it had less hair than the rest of the body.  Even in the crouched position it was still 4-5 feet tall.",

            "Observed": "Sighting number #2 was 3/20/2014. This just happened two days ago. I saw what I never thought I would see again, and how different this one was. Me and my friend was coming back from a road trip south when we decided to go down to a place on the Embarras River.  I like to fish and swim at what's called Spencer's Bridge. This used to be a county road that used to lead to a bridge that crossed the river, but the bridge is long and the area floods so much, no one uses it except for people fishing and swimming. I was going really slow because it had just been grated from the last flood. When in front of me I saw a fast dark moving object, it ran on all fours towards the tree line . When it turned south I could see that it was running on all fours as a ape would but fast. It stopped and turned towards us and you could see that it was dual colored, white on one side and brown on other, different yeah. It was too far away to get any more specific on the coloring but this one was much more heavier and hairier. Couldn't really see just how tall he was but his mass was a lot bigger than the last one I seen but that was in the dead of summer He turned and took one last look at us and disappeared into brush. This would of been about 5 miles from where I saw my first one.",
