            "Observed.1  ": "Forget about the occasional wayward bear \u0097 a local man thinks we might have ourselves a Bigfoot, and the evidence he\u0092s gathered suggests that maybe we do   BY ERIC JOHNSON   AUGUSTA, GA - Dave Collier has never come face to face with a Bigfoot, but he\u0092s talked to plenty of people who have. \u0093I believe that sightings and encounters are more common than most people believe,\u0094 he says. \u0093And what surprised me the most when I started this was how many there were in this area.\u0094 By this area, the Martinez resident doesn\u0092t mean the Southeast, and he\u0092s not just talking Georgia. Collier means right here in the CSRA.  Working for a public utility, Collier is perfectly positioned to be a Bigfoot researcher. He\u0092s out among the public all day, often in rural locations, he deals with people in a relatively relaxed setting, and he deals with a lot of them. Though he\u0092s consumed by the Bigfoot question \u0097 does it exist and if it does, how has it managed to remain so elusive for all these years \u0097 he doesn\u0092t come right out and ask people if they\u0092ve ever seen Bigfoot. That kind of directness would just shut them down. But if he sees evidence that the person might be an outdoorsman, he\u0092ll eventually steer the small talk around to the outdoors, maybe starting with some fishing or hunting stories before moving toward an icebreaker like, \u0093So\u0085 have you ever run across anything unusual in the woods?\u0094 While he admits the belief spectrum is pretty wide as far as Sasquatch is concerned, he says quite a few have actually confessed to having had some kind of encounter. \u0093And that\u0092s just sampling the smallest, random percentage of the population,\u0094 he says. The more people he talks to, the less surprised he is by what on the surface seems like such a disproportional response. \u0093The vast majority of people who have an encounter don\u0092t call the media or the sheriff, they just want to keep it to themselves,\u0094 he says. \u0093They don\u0092t want to expose themselves to ridicule.\u0094 Collier knows about ridicule. Like all Bigfoot researchers, he\u0092s taken his share of ribbing and dodged some, too, like the close call he had a while back when WGAC talk-show host Austin Rhodes got a hold of one of the flyers he\u0092s distributed throughout town. \u0093That could have been bad,\u0094 he says with a chuckle. \u0093He could have really let me have it.\u0094 \u0093Bigfoot information wanted,\u0094 the poster reads. \u0093Any sightings or encounters with large, manlike animals sometimes called Sasquatch, Bigfoot or swamp ape. All reports wanted.\u0094 Collier devotes most of his free time to his hobby. He has read thousands of reports and is constantly amazed by what he considers the sincerity of the stories. If people wanted to make something up, he says, they could do a far better job. \u0093If it hits below the Holy Crap mark,\u0094 he says, \u0093it\u0092s probably true.\u0094 Collier\u0092s Holy Crap threshold might be a bit higher than most, however. Plenty of what he\u0092s come across in his day-to-day interactions is downright mystifying. Like the guy outside Thomson who found his fishing trotline pulled up on shore with the bodies of his catch twisted off and the heads still on the hooks. Or the guy in Graniteville who saw a hairy figure clear a large incline in only two strides. Or, even closer to home, several encounters sprinkled along the Savannah River in Columbia County. Kids who grew up in that area a few years ago talk of a hairy creature they would sometimes see in the woods when they would venture out to their secret spot to party. They called it the Wolfman. One guy Collier talked to remembers coming up on it and running away, another talked about seeing one wrestle with a beaver just around the corner from that first sighting, and yet another heard strange howling sounds, as if a group of animals were closing in on their prey. \u0093All of a sudden, I\u0092m finding a grouping over there,\u0094 Collier says. So, as he often does, he decided to go out and see for himself. Granted, it was a couple of years later, but to him it made sense to try. Sure, the area had become more developed, but the Sumter National Forest was still right across the water. Looking for prints and stick formations (researchers suspect Sasquatches may actually bend small trees and position branches as a form of communication) is a daytime activity, but a Bigfoot investigation like this occurs at night. \u0093It was so dark that I had to use an LED light to stay on the trail,\u0094 he says. When he got to the end of the trail, he whacked a tree with a piece of wood, a technique called wood knocking, which is thought to be another form of communication. Something knocked in reply. \u0093The next thing I know, I hear something coming through the woods all the way across the water\u0085 coming toward me,\u0094 Collier says. Then, in the still, cool silence of early morning, he heard something walking back and forth on the other side of the water. \u0093So, I\u0092m hearing this breaking brush and then finally the sun just barely cracks and I hear this huge limb snap off, and I think \u0097 whoa, whatever that was, it was big.\u0094 As exciting as it was, Collier knows that to some his encounter is incomplete. \u0093All I have is a story,\u0094 he says. \u0093I heard something, but I didn\u0092t see anything.\u0094 Someone who did see something is Jack Hovatter. In the fall of 1971, Hovatter was hunting the small arms impact area of Fort Gordon with his son when he noticed a large footprint. The footprint was so large, in fact, that his first inclination was that it was the front and back prints of a bear that had blurred together. But on closer inspection, the print was obviously not made by a bear. \u0093It looked like a huge human track except for it was kind of a flatfooted human,\u0094 he remembers. \u0093It didn\u0092t make that much of an impression on the ground because the ground was so hard back there.\u0094 Hovatter set his gun barrel beside the print and gauged it to be about 22 inches long and about nine inches across the ball of the foot. In that same area, in the vicinity of a nearly impenetrable thicket at the bottom of the ravine, he noticed what he thought were about a dozen very large ant hills. \u0093We dug down to the bottom,\u0094 he said, \u0093but it was just sand piled on the ground.\u0094 No ants. No ant holes. \u0093It was like a three- or four-gallon bucket was dumped there,\u0094 he says. In spite of the track and the strange piles of sand, he returned another day to investigate the thicket. It was a decision he will never forget. \u0093I heard something up on the other side of that hill,\u0094 he says. \u0093I looked, and some animal came rolling down that hill that wasn\u0092t even on its feet most of the time. It was a little bit far away to tell what it was or exactly how big it was, but I could see it was dark and I could see this salt-and-pepper look about it.\u0094 He swung around the ravine to cut back on the creature and got a strong whiff of something that smelled like vomit. \u0093That\u0092s what it was,\u0094 he says. \u0093There was a big pile of it up there. About three gallon\u0092s worth, I\u0092d say. I took a stick and investigated it, and it had a piece of deer skin in there that was about two feet square.\u0094 Hovatter figures the deer skin, which was partially missing its hair, had made the creature sick, because the rest of the pile consisted of poorly chewed acorns. \u0093That really made me wonder what it was, so I started in [the small opening he found in the thicket] and I only got about 10 or 12 feet in there when I heard something coming toward me\u0085 and there it was. It was this man-ape looking thing, all covered with this super-dark hair, expect I could still see that flaking of grey. This thing apparently lived in there, and I didn\u0092t like the look on its face.\u0094 Having the presence of mind to compare it to a basketball hoop, he estimates it was 10 feet tall and nearly five feet across the shoulders, which is considered big even in the Bigfoot community. \u0093Its arms were massive, but proportionally they were a little bit longer than a man\u0092s arms,\u0094 he says. \u0093I didn\u0092t see any ears and its hair was kind of short, almost like a hound dog. It didn\u0092t have any hair around its eyes or its mouth or its nose, and I suppose the palms of its hands and the soles of its feet didn\u0092t have any hair on them, either.\u0094 The pathway was extremely narrow, and knowing he didn\u0092t want to provoke the creature, which he says looked disturbed by his presence, he resisted the urge to run, and though he had his gun, a 16-gauge, semi-automatic shotgun loaded with slugs, he says he never considered using it. \u0093I felt like I had a BB gun in my hands,\u0094 he says. \u0093Comparing it to horses and cows, I\u0092d say it weighed at least 1,000 pounds, maybe as much as a hundred more.\u0094 Slowly, he continued to back up until he was out of the thicket. The creature remained inside. \u0093I went right up to the head of the ravine, up to the rifle range and back to my truck,\u0094 he says. \u0093Lord, was I glad to get back into my truck.\u0094 He told his brother in Tennessee about the encounter, and his brother rounded up someone from a natural resources organization, who called Fort Gordon to get permission to investigate. When they arrived, however, the ravine had been bulldozed and the thicket was gone. Hovatter had another sighting during the fall of 1991, at the Yuchi Wildlife Management Area in Burke County, when he saw a hairy, bipedal creature sitting down at the base of a tree. Though it might seem strange for one person to have two separate encounters while so many of the rest of us have never even had one, Hovatter says it\u0092s all a function of his relationship with the outdoors. \u0093Most people when they go hunting don\u0092t go very far from their vehicle because they figure if they get a deer, how are they going to get it back,\u0094 he says. \u0093Me \u0097 I don\u0092t really go deer hunting to kill a deer. I just enjoy being out, so I don\u0092t worry about that kind of thing. I get way back in there.\u0094 To Collier, Hovatter\u0092s encounter is additionally significant because it coincides with two other sightings in the same general area at the same general time, including one he recently discovered where an area woman saw one near the Dearing Ponds. According to the witness, a creature about the same size as the one observed by Hovatter rose up out of one of the ponds covered in green algae. \u0093If this is all just a bunch of BS, it\u0092s strange that you start getting these clusters,\u0094 Collier says. Besides that, he says, if somebody\u0092s trying to pull a fast one, what\u0092s the point of coming up with such detailed information and then setting it 30-some years in the past? And what are the odds of hearing it as a result of a purely random inquiry? Spearheading the coordinated research into the Bigfoot mystery is the Bigfoot Field Research Organization (BFRO). Established in 1995, the group has a few hundred active members spread across the continental U.S. and Canada, including a few in Georgia, mostly in the southeast corner of the state. According to Mike Aragona, a curator and investigator, BFRO investigators come from all walks of life, though most have one predominant similarity. \u0093The majority of the people grew up in the \u009270s with the whole Roger Patterson footage,\u0094 he says. Taken in 1967, the Patterson Footage, which shows a hairy, ape-like creature walking through the woods, made Bigfoot a household name across the nation, spawning such \u009270s classics as \u0093The Legend of Boggy Creek.\u0094 Soon, Bigfoot became a tabloid staple and a cameo player in shows like \u0093The Six Million Dollar Man\u0094 and \u0093In Search Of.\u0094 A few men of science, like anatomy and anthropology professor Dr. Jeff Meldrum and fingerprint expert Jimmy Chilcutt, brought scientific and forensic credentials to the search, but mostly the academic world has taken a pass on Sasquatch. \u0093Overall, I don\u0092t think the academic community is accepting that these creatures exist,\u0094 Aragona says. \u0093It\u0092s a level of arrogance, really. It\u0092s people who don\u0092t go out in the woods, who already have it set in their minds that there\u0092s no way they\u0092re out there.\u0094 Using the reach and power of the Internet, BFRO founder Matthew Moneymaker set out to create an informational clearinghouse for Bigfoot information. On the BFRO Web site, bfro.net, witnesses can submit detailed reports of their sightings, whether recent or historical, and have them classified in two ways: as an outright sighting like Hovatter\u0092s, or as an encounter with evidence like vocalizations, woodknocks or footprints. The Web site lists thousands of sightings, including 79 in Georgia. As for what exactly the creature is, Aragona says they\u0092re getting closer to an answer. \u0093The overall consensus in the BFRO and the greater Bigfoot community is that it\u0092s a primate, either like us or like the great apes,\u0094 he says. \u0093It might be a giant ape like gigantopithecus that\u0092s managed to survive. Whatever it is, it\u0092s an intelligent primate.\u0094 Detractors, of course, would say that the existence of some kind of prehistoric cousin is next to impossible, but Aragona says such common logic doesn\u0092t always make sense. First of all, as a species we\u0092ve been through a lot ourselves without going extinct, and, in order to survive side by side with us, a Bigfoot-like creature would have to have mastered skills of evasion, like being nocturnal, being shy and living ever deeper in the woods, he says. \u0093We believe their only natural enemy is man,\u0094 Collier says. \u0093We actually believe they avoid making tracks.\u0094 While that might seem like a convenient excuse for a general lack of evidence, in recent months Collier himself has come across some interesting tracks, and while he admits they are far from conclusive, they\u0092re nevertheless enough to make him go, \u0093Hmm.\u0094 And to him, that\u0092s what the quest for Bigfoot is all about. \u0093I guess it fascinates me because, at my age, there aren\u0092t many more mysteries in life,\u0094 he says. \u0093If one eventually does get nailed by a car or something, I guess it will be kind of fun to say \u0091I told you so,\u0092 but the other side of me is like, well, there goes that hobby.\u0094 Aragona agrees it\u0092s going to take a body to convince modern science of Bigfoot\u0092s existence. Any other evidence, including the heralded \u0093Kentucky\u0094 footage he says should be released this fall, will always be suspect. Hovatter, however, doesn\u0092t need convincing. \u0093I know one thing \u0097 I don\u0092t feel safe in any area where they are if I\u0092m not armed\u0085 and I don\u0092t feel real safe then,\u0094 he says. \u0093I would not go out at night and get out of a vehicle, that\u0092s for sure. I\u0092m 71 years old and I\u0092d like to live to at least what the average is.\u0094    ",
