            "Follow-Up Report": " I talked to the witness by phone: He heard four howls, each about four seconds long and about ten minutes apart. They came from the same location and he could hear dogs bark in the distance after each howl. I asked what made these unique from human vocals and he said the howls were \"too deep and ape-like.\" The witness did research elk and other animal sounds. The video he refers to is: You Tube, Finding Bigfoot - The Sounds of Bigfoot. He said the vocals he heard were the same as what was broadcasting in this video.  The recording that was broadcasting in this video is the famous \"Ohio Howl\" recorded by Matt Moneymaker in 1994. See https://youtu.be/TPCcLddBekYThis location is near the Class B report 62332 that happened December 31, 2018. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Del Kerly at length about his encounter. He was deer hunting on 46 acres of woodland near where he lives. From his stand he saw a tree shaking violently in the woodline. Through his scope he saw a large black haired creature, back in the woods and swaying side to side. It had a cone shaped head and seemed over eight feet tall. Del reported a smell like wet dog also. Some of the hair had a reddish appearance. He saw it for several seconds through his scope.Other incidents from this property include:-His nephew had \"softball\" sized rocks thrown at him from the woods, while hunting.- Stick structures, of odd, unnatural appearance have shown up on the property.-The deer movement on the property has changed, as they seem to be hiding.-Del has found large footprints.-He got a strange picture of what appears to be an arm, reaching in front of his trail cam near salt licks he had place for deer.",
