            "Follow-Up Report": "The first sighting took place when the property owner was taking a bag of garbage out. She initially forgot it in the kitchen after she had already dumped the leftover food scraps for the critters on the side of the gravel driveway. On her way back with the bag of garbage is when she noticed a massive creature standing behind her full size pick-up truck's front cab watching her as she headed towards the garbage can. Once seeing this creature, she dropped the bag and ran into her house to tell her husband. Her husband then came outside with a flashlight to look around, but it was gone. They have an outside light on the house that shines where the cars are parked which enabled her to see the details she described. Judging by the height of the cab on the truck, it was estimated that the creature in question was at least 7 1/2 to 8 foot tall or more.The next day they found tracks going up the hillside to and from the food scrap pile. The larger tracks measured 14.5 inches long and 7 inches wide at the ball.The daughter's sighting in 2012 consisted of her hearing some noises behind the large woodpile on the back right corner of the property while she was painting some benches. When she went to investigate and looked over into the wood pile, she saw a large hair covered creature looking at her from the hillside. Once it saw her, it went behind the trees and she quickly fled to the house in a very frightened condition. Once finally calm, she told her mother what she saw which fit the description of what the mother saw the previous year.When the grandson was interviewed away from the grandparents, he explained that a gorilla was looking into the window of the house as he was looking out the window. When asked how close it was to the window, he said from me to you which was roughly three feet. The grand kids had not been told of any of the prior incidents and are now quite nervous when playing in the backyard. Judging by how high the window sill was on the house it was easy to say that the gorilla was easily over 7 1/2 feet tall or more. And for the record, the grandson was interviewed by a middle school Principal who has a long history dealing with students from all different age groups.After an even more thorough phone interview, I decided to send out fellow BFRO investigator Jason Kovalski for an on-the-spot follow-up investigation. His report goes as follows....After the initial report, I went out to the residence in Bethesda on June 12th, 2014. I spoke with all three witnesses to confirm the original report. I located and cast two possible tracks, both different sizes. The residence sits on a point, with an approximate drop in elevation of 10 feet about 90 feet from the house. The house is at the tip of a wooded hollow. The hollow leads to a swamp and eventually to a reservoir and railroad tracks. Since there had been sightings within the previous three weeks of the report, I decided it was best to do a night investigation as soon as possible. On June 15, another investigator and I went out to the residence at about 8:30 pm. We sat below the fire pit where one of the sightings had occurred. At approximately 10:15 PM we heard cracking off in the distance, somewhere near the swamp area. Within five minutes the cracking noise had moved closer and dogs in the distance began barking. It was at this point that we decided that the cracking was footsteps. As the noise came closer, we moved back approximately 60 feet closer to the house. The area was very quiet with no sign of animals other than raccoons. At this point the raccoons began to move closer to us, actually at our feet. It became apparent that the footsteps were heavy and moving closer to us. Because it was a moonlit night, we could see a short distance into the woods. When the footsteps stopped I noticed a large figure approximately 50-60 yards away, standing behind a tree. The figure appeared to be swaying back and forth behind the tree. I could not see any definition to the figure. While watching the figure, we could hear cracking again near the figure. Footsteps began to move to the right of the figure. It was at this point that we realized that there was more than one. The footsteps continued to move away from the first figure, moving closer to the area where the homeowners had been throwing food scraps, the same area where I cast the tracks. I had parked my full size SUV near that spot. I could not see it from my location, but Jim, the other investigator saw a figure pop its head up over the roof of my SUV. The SUV stands approximately 76 inches high. Jim said he could see approximately 6 inches of the top of the figure. He was watching the figure by the SUV while I was watching the figure in the woods. One of the creatures let out a grunt/growl that neither of us had ever heard before. Within 2 \u0096 3 minutes we heard the cracking foot steps move off into the distance. After it was apparent that they were gone, the raccoons moved back towards the woods. We discussed what we had seen and heard and we are confident that the homeowners report was a legitimate report.This area will be continually monitored by the Ohio BFRO investigation team.Here are photos of one of the casts taken and the track:",

I never saw big foot until one day when my son and I went to Tule Lake to do some fishing. We were on the bank fishing and he snuck up on us and watched us fishing but we couldn't see him. Then he walked on around to the other side of the lake. This lake is probably the size of a football field. He came out of the timber and there is a short spread of grass he walked through. Thats when we saw him. My son too I think.  He had taken up residence there for some time because all the animals left the area. It was high in all kinds of wildlife.  I saw him one other time not too far from the lake down on the Nisqually River.  My father saw him on top of Muck Creek hill. I use to tell my friends but they were very skeptical until they asked my son. That boy never lies. Then they were believers.  I am a very good tracker and have gone in look for him. I could hear him but he would stay down wind so I couldn't smell him. If you want to hear more, get ahold of me.",
