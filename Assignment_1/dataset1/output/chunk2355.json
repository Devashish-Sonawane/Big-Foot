The vocalizations started out like an owl sound, but became growls, that merged back into a howling at the end.Trees were shook and objects were thrown into our campsite. Small sapling trees were thrown, roots first, across our campsite.We would build up the fire and it would go away, but when the fire would die down it would return.This continued for hours until almost daybreak.We found sapling trees broken off and uprooted all around our camp. We tried to pull up a tree slightly smaller than the ones uprooted but both of us together couldn't pull one out of the ground.I would gladly submit to a polygraph test to prove my truthfulness.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, A.H. He stated the he and a friend (now deceased) had decided to take a few days and look for ginseng root, on some private mining ground near the Kentucky/Virginia border. They were dropped off near the property, and had spent 3 days leisurely trecking through the mountainous area, digging ginseng during the day, and camping at night. He described the terrain as difficult, being steep and littered with deep chasms from the long wall mining that had been done in the area. He stated that the area was very remote and seldom visited by people due to the difficult hiking. After a severe thunderstorm, they finally reached a cliff/overhang where they prepared their camp, building a fire and settling in for the evening. They were awakened late in the night by loud howls and chattering. They immediately built up the fire, and the animal backed off, but continued to howl and circle their camp. Armed only with knives, they fastened them to long sticks to make spears. Large rocks \"big enough to kill you\" were thrown into the camp as were sapling trees 2-3 inches in diameter. Around 4 am they had exhausted the wood close within the light of the fire. As the fire died down, the animal backed off, but could still be heard in the distance. He said it was like the adrenaline drained from them and they drifted into light sleep. At first light they gathered their things and hiked as quickly as they could out to the road, which took most of that day. This encounter has had a profound effect. He stated that he can remember the incidents as though it happened yesterday. He now carries a large caliber handgun anytime he goes into the woods.  He also knows of other encounters nearby, but due to the local culture, most people involved are reluctant to talk about them.",

Across the road from his house there is a large swamp that goes up to a small mountain.  Our talk was cut short by an odd scream about 75 yards into the swamp on the right at ground level.  I asked my friend, an avid hunter, what animal screams like that?  He didn't know but we talked that maybe it could be an owl or a fisher.  A few minutes later, in the woods on our side of the road, a large animal broke a lot of dead branches all at once.  It wasn't running but seemed to have just turned around in one location.  A minute or two later three owls hooted between themselves at treetop level in the woods behind his house.  The owls seemed to have been about 50 feet apart.  We commented about this sudden weird activity when something came from the woods and landed in his yard behind us.  We were still facing the road and didn't see the object but I assume it was something around the size of a baseball.  He doesn't have a manicured lawn and it would be impossible to know exactly what it was.  I've thought about this incident for a couple of months and could write off the first three occurrences that evening but the object landing in the yard made this event too much to ignore.  My friend was as puzzled as I am.  He lives where people are few and far between.",
