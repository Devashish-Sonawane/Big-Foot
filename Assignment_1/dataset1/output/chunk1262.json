They stopped delivering newspapers because they both had day jobs so they had very little time to sleep in between. It wasn't sustainable. Newspaper delivery drivers work in the wee hours of the morning. They are often witnesses to sasquatches and other wildlife that no one else will see due to the hours they operate.The neighborhood in question is on the edge of Roanoke County. The other side of the county line is Bedford County with a large, densely forested wild area. It is private land containing two large reservoirs. The nearest one is Falling Creek Reservoir. The encounter happened at the very end of Falling Creek Drive. The habitat is a hilly with a mix of oaks and conifers and loads of deer.",
