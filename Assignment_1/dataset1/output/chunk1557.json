            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness over the phone I determined that he is a credible observer. The witness was on a personal water craft, traveling close to the shore on the Pit River arm of lake Shasta. He estimated his speed to be around 25 mph. At the time of the sighting he was several miles upstream from Jones Valley Resort. The water level was low and numerous snags (old trees that are usually submerged) were sticking up around the shore. As he rounded a point he noticed what looked like a head sticking up out of the water among the snags about 20 feet from the shore. He stated that the head was about the size of a football helmet, covered in long, wet, tan colored hair. He compared the color of the hair to a coyote.The face was flat, the mouth was not visible, the eyes were human shaped, large and dark. When he first spotted the \"head\" he was approximately 20 to 30 feet away from it. He locked eyes for a few seconds. It then ducked underwater as he rode by leaving a ripple in the calm surface. He continued on for about 30 seconds while he tried to process what he had just seen. By this time he had traveled about 300 yards and decided to turn back. He returned and slowly searched the area for any sign of the creature. He noted that there were no fresh \"wet\" tracks on the shore and saw no sign of the animal. After several minutes of searching he started to worry that the animal may still be around and that it might come out of the water and pull him off his PWC. At this point he decided to leave the area.",
