            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length about his sighting. He is 57 years old and still serves in the National Guard. He recently returned from Afghanistan. He was a young boy (8 years old) at the time of the incident. He still remembers it well. He was with his friend Eddie. They were playing down by the creek. They looked up and saw this hair covered man looking thing walking from rock to rock with his head down. It was not in a hurry. He said it swung its arms a bit when it walked.The total time they saw it, even after bringing the adults over, was 10 to 15 minutes. The adults seemed very excited and scared and would not let the young boys look through the binoculars. He recalls them arguing back and forth about what it could be.This is a very remote area only accessable by boat. I have been to Holden Village a few times. In that area there is nothing but wilderness around you in every direction around.  ",
