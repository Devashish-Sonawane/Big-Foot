            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness at length and found him to be credible. Here are some details that I would like to emphasize:- When I spoke with the witness he was with his girlfriend, whose family lives at the residence. She did not discredit his story.- He heard the howling in intervals over a 45 minute period.- The witness feels that the Columbiana County howl recording from 1994 documented the same sounds that he heard that night.- He has heard the howling since the initial incident, but the howls haven't been as loud as the howls that he heard initially.- He has not gone out to seek evidence in daylight hours. He said it scares him to even drive down the country roads at night, fearing that a bigfoot could appear on the road.- Satellite images show that the area is densely forested, and sparsely populated.

The sound of the foot steps were very heavy and we could hear branches breaking as it moved around.  My partner and I were a few hundred yards apart and the noise came from a thick cover between our spots.  We both heard it as my partner called me on the two way asking if I could hear it too.  I don't know that it was a bigfoot however it was scarry enough for me to remove the safety from my gun and actually swing in the direction it came from knowing my partner was in that direction as well.  I have continued to hunt the area since then and have had no further incident.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.   He stated that he heard a series of whoops and screams followed immediately by loud branch breaking sounds that sounded like very large branches being broken.   He thought it was coming from the direction of his partner so he radioed his hunting partner on his two-way radio and his partner heard the same sounds and thought it was coming from his way.   This meant the source of the sound was obviously between them, which was a low gulley and thickly wooded.He said the sounds only lasted about a minute but unnerved both hunters.  He only sat there for a little more before going back to the campsite and sitting by the fire. He went back out later in the afternoon without incident and has camped and hunted the spot several times since without incident. The largest animal in that part of the state is the whitetail deer, which does not make that kind of noises and do not normally repeatedly break large branches.I have personally experienced large branch breaking during BFRO expeditions and while scouting and doing investigation follow-ups, by which I believe to be sasquatch.  I believe they may do it as a way to scare people away without a confrontation. If it was not a deer, the other two possibilities would be a sasquatch or a person.   A person would be fool hardy to make such noises during firearms deer season in an area where hunters are known to be.  This leads me to believe that he heard a sasquatch which probably knew the hunters were present and was doing an intimidation display to spook the men out of the area, without getting close enough to get shot at.The Pinckney State Recreation Area is a large tract of state land in southern Michigan that is dotted with small lakes and is quite thickly wooded.   It is heavily populated with whitetail deer.  ",
