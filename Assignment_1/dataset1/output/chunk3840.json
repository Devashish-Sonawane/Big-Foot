There was a path leading from our property with a cornfield on one side and forest on the other which led to more deeply forested area. We could see on the path places where the spool had been rolled and places where it had been picked up and carried. Large, human-like footprints were also found on the path. The spool was found about a mile away from the house. It had been tossed into a steep gulley.",
