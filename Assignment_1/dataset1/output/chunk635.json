            "Follow-Up Report": "On the morning of May 4, 2011 I met a friend at Wallace Falls State Park to hike up to the boggy area described by the witness. It was a sunny day, with temps in the lower- to mid-60's, great weather for the nearly 5-mile uphill hike in. We found the swampy area, bounded on the NE by a 1,000-foot high rocky cliff, and a 200-foot high heavily forested ridge to the SW. A stream was dammed by beavers, creating a large pond, with abundant signs of recent beaver activity- fresh branches in the dam, and trees recently gnawed or felled. There was a large amount of skunk cabbage in this marshy area as well. We crossed the pond by way of the dam, and searched around in the forest. We immediately found a 3-foot tall \"teepee\" made of downed trees and sticks, some of which were very rotten and had obviously been on the ground at one point. There were also some rock piles nearby, made up of 6 to 8-inch stones, yet no other rocks were found anywhere in the area. Curious, but inconclusive as to how the sticks or the stones came to be there. There was no sign of any human presence in this stretch of forest, either from the past or present. Owing to the remoteness of the swamp, the plentiful food sources, and close proximity to high mountain lakes and streams, it is entirely conceivable that the witness heard sasquatch vocalizations, but this investigation turned up no concrete evidence of sasquatches recently in the area.
