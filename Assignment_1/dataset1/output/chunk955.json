            "Follow-Up Report": "This is the first thermal footage ever obtained of a sasquatch, though its quality will not stand on its own to convince the world. The key portion is only about a second long. This shortfall doesn't change its authenticity, and thus its importance. Several people in the BFRO heard the distinct sounds of sasquatches in this same area during a BFRO expedition in 2006. Since then we have gotten to know Don Young very well. He's a local hunting guide outside Phillips and a maker of hand crafted fishing lures. During the 2006 BFRO expedition in Wisconsin, Don Young's outdoors skills and knowledge impressed Wally Hersom -- the BFRO's main sponsor.  A year later Don obtained an interesting, but dimly lit photo which showed an apparent sasquatch. Don got the photo with a trail camera provided by Doug Hajicek (producer of \"Monsterquest\" TV series).  Doug Hajicek was shown the photo but was not interested in doing anything with it. Wally Hersom was more interested in the photo. He purchased the rights to it. Thereafter Wally loaned several devices to Don Young, including a thermal imager.  For months Don tried different tactics for getting footage using the thermal and various other devices provided by Wally.  In July 2008 Don decided to camp out for a few days at place where several incidents had occurred over the course of a few years. Don had no fire or lanterns, intentionally. He waited for a few days before action started happening at night, a portion of this action he was luckily able to record.This footage shows behavior that is relevant to a perplexing question about this species:  How could this species so consistently avoid being photographed or killed by humans? The behavior documented is cautiously and patiently observant, and it is strategically evasive, and it is happening in near absolute darkness.To download this footage go to the BFRO's public discussion forum and register for the forum. We need to throttle the server requests this way. After registering, look for the sub-section titled \"New Video Clips\". You will not be able to access this section unless you log in.  In that section look for the thread mentioning the \"link to the Don Young footage\". ",
