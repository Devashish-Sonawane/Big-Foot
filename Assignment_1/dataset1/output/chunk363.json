I only saw the back of it but he said it was NOT a human and was surely a Big Foot.",

His back porch faces north towards the river, which is within eyesight and very close.  He reports that while using the restroom, he saw something out of the window that caught his eye.  At first, he thought that maybe it was his neighbor.  He looked again and saw that it was not his neighbor, but rather a reddish brown colored creature, completely covered in hair.  It was about 6' 2\" tall and \"thick\".  He described it as being only 20 yards away when it was walking towards the river.  He watched it take several steps before disappearing into the tree line and down into the river bottom.  He was positive that it was not a person--he saw hair from \"mid thigh up\" and the hair on the head was longer.  He repeated that this sighting was at noon in broad daylight.  The creature did not turn around and he did not see its face.  \"There is no way that this thing was human.\" He clearly saw that the creature was covered in hair, but noted that the hair on its head was longer than on the rest of its body.  Once it was in the trees, its color looked a lot darker.  When it was in the sunlight, it was light reddish brown.  He seemed like a reliable witness with nothing to gain or lose from talking to me.
