            "Observed.1  ": "Most generally, the reported monster has kept to the Kickapoo Creek area ambling in and around the river and near by timber area.  It is as big as a cow, some say . . . Its eyes are red and it snorts, others claim.  The eating habits of the unchained creature are a bit strange as one individual, who after sighting the creature, followed it and found a string of opened clams, but half eaten minnows.  Three Rantoul youths recently decided on a fishing trip very early in the morning.  As they were trekking down toward the river in the marshy, foggy, bottom land, they saw in their car\u0092s headlight, it.  At the time, the trio, non of whom were aware of previous creature sightings, tried to discover what it was.  Their lights did not seem to bother him, her, or it, any as it, him, or her, continued along ambling through the shore of the river heading for the nearby  timber.  The trio, well schooled in the Boy Scouts and being prepared, took their collective weapons of a hunting knife, a flashlight, and fishing knife, and sought to stalk the creature.  They claimed it was about as big as a cow, which, was standing on its back two legs.  They said it did not make a sound which was audible and it moved into the timber and they lost track of it.  The Bloomington Pantagraph had a report of a sighting some two weeks ago, but this time, he, she, or it was in the Farmer City area.  \u0093Something destroyed some tents and scared the daylights out of some kids who were camping,: it was reported.  The Rantoul trio, after failing in their attempt to find the monster, settled down to fish a little when they heard a rustling in the woods behind them.  This time, it was not the monster but a local farmer who was complaining about fences being down and his cattle scattered all over the country side.  A spokesman for the DeWitt County Sheriff\u0092s office gave little credence to the story:  We had a monster up near Weldon Springs a few years ago and it turned out to be a kid playing games with a bear rug.\u0094  A resident of Farmer City claimed:  \u0093There is not truth to that story at all.  It is just a couple of long haired hippies who are causing trouble.\u0094  No matter what he, she, it, is; it , he , she, is real to young fishermen from Rantoul. ",

I saw it leaning on a tree.\" \"The trampoline is just about 110 yards from the edge of the woods.\" The two friends walked us back to the exact spot they believe they saw Bigfoot. \"I was pretty scared when I saw that.\" David Radeztsky's mom brushed the boy's off \"What was your initial response? I said oh that's nice, just trying to be a good mother but not believing it.\" Five days later she heard about the sighting in Washington County. \"Then I saw your newscast and I thought that was interesting because it's not too far from Holy Hill where we live. If Bigfoot was in the area maybe he did stop by our backyard.\" David and Dillon are sticking to their story \"I think that he was in the Wisconsin and that he is real\" The parents would like to know what they saw especially if it's a wild animal.",
