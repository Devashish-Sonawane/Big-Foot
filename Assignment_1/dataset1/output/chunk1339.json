They then heard a very loud scream and all forest sounds stopped. This happened May 08 thats what made me submit this report because the areas are in the same tract of forrest. The same friend had an encounter in canada when he was mountain biking. On his way back from a train something piled sticks and stone in the middle of the trail and he was the only one riding that remote trail that day.",

He decided to submit a report only after hearing of his friend's incident while turkey hunting (see Other Stories section of this report).The witness stated he considered that bigfoot/sasquatch are mostly found in the pacific northwest and had been skeptical of reports from the east coast of North America; although he has had a Class B incident in the Adirondacks several years ago and has heard other stories as well.  After our interview and discussion he was more comfortable with the idea that these animals are found all over the continent and has little to fear from them.",
