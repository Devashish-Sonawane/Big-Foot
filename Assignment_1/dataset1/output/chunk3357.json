The Air Force reopened it in 1960. Go towards the mountains on base untill you see the thick forest area. I don't know if the barracks are still there or not. Likely not.",

His friend did, because he had run ahead of him chasing his dogs.- Immediately after the dogs raced off, the vocalization emanated from the nearby woods again.- The sound was very loud and unlike anything he had ever heard before.- The witness observed one dog already down and the other being thrown through the air. His exact words: \u0093One dog was already hurt and the other was airborne.\u0094- One dog suffered a large wound to its left side. He described the side as torn \u0096 \u0093not cut\u0094. Both dogs survived.-There was loud crashing and breaking of brush and trees as the creature ran away. - He described a lingering odor in the area of the confrontation with the dogs. It was as a mix of body odor, feces and skunk. - He is adamant this was not a bear.  The dog's wound was not from a claw.",
