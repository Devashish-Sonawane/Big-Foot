            "Follow-Up Report": "Harriman State Park is the second largest park in the NYS park system. The Skyscrapers of NYC are visible from the highest peaks in the park. The park is the crown jewel of the Palisades Interstate (NY and NJ) park system. 31 lakes and reservoirs, 47500 acres of pristine \"Forever Wild\" wilderness. The US Military Academy at West Point is 20 miles to the Northeast. NYC is only 30 miles to the Southeast.The Appalachian Trail \"AT\" crosses Seven Lakes Road, and the area is a major junction for the AT and \"The Long Path\" which starts at the 175th Street Subway in NYC and proceeds north to the Catskills and ends at the Adirondack Park. The Path connects the three largest NYS parks (Harriman, Catskill, and Adirondack) in NYS. The Long Path has spurs connecting the High Point (NJ) State Park where there have been several Bigfoot sightings and BFRO expeditions. Sighting occurred one mile west of the intersection of the two trails.I Interviewed the witness, he mentioned BFRO report 5703 occurred in a basically the same area at the same time of the year.Witness was with two friends, college friends.  Playing classic rock with the windows open (no beer, no drugs). They like to get lost at night in the park driving around.Arden Valley Road is seasonal is gravel paved road, no shoulders. Sighting occurred about 2 Miles east of I-87. Appalachian trail is actually on Arden Valley road.  No houses or buildings on the road. Some streams, summer camps, and lakes on the road. Extremely twisty road, very hilly.  Road is built into the hill. Creature was seen at the edge of the headlights. They were driving a Pontiac Grand Am with the high beams on.Creature was brownish-grey color.  Saw from the waist down, heavy, stocky built legs. Had two steps into the street then ascended up the hill. They came to a dead stop and the other passengers heard the creature moving through the woods. Leaf litter walking on leaves and sticks.Creature took two steps across the road, from the center of the road to the edge.  Headlights only lit the bottom half of the creature. Legs and Butt looked very muscular \"Top physical form\" Creature moved fluidly. Moved with a purpose to get out of the way.  Thighs were huge like a football player. Hair had a sheen, but flat. Hair looked like orangutan hair, long and straight. Salt and pepper hair. ",
