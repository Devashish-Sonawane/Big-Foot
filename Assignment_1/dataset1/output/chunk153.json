            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness and January and was taken to the general area of the sighting. I will also be speaking to one of the other men who was on this camping weekend. The witness is a lifelong hunter, and outdoors man who has raised cattle and exotics. He knows his wildlife, this weekend changed his outlook regarding animals in his part of the world.Details that can be added:The witness believes the hunters encountered a family group that contained at least two smaller individuals based on the nesting area he found. He also feels the mumbling they heard when in their tree stands were made by males, as the voices were so deep in nature.  The witness played the Whoop vocalization from Ron Moorehead's web site for me and said it is very close to what he heard, except that what he heard was a loud, long, extended vocalization that ended with a whoop. The creature vocalized twice. In regard to the roaring vocalization he has not been able to find any recording that compares to the sound he heard that night.People may ask why the witness didn't take photographs of the nests and other tree structures, but understand it was 1983 and the witness had no idea what these structures were, and had never seen anything like them. Cell phones were not in use at that time. This weekend profoundly changed the way witness viewed the area, and made him far more aware of his surroundings. He continued to hunt after this experience, but never went back to that location again, even though he had been hunting it for 7 years.The Black Kettle National Grasslands is located in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma and Hemphill County, Texas. It contains 31,286 acres and consists of about 100 tracts of land inter-spaced with privately owned ranch land. It is located in the mixed grass prairie region. The terrain is characterized by sandy and red slate hills in addition to grassland and oak brush. The creek bottoms are wooded with cottonwood, elm, and Hackberry. Wildlife includes white-tailed deer, turkey and quail. The Washita River flows through the grassland. Other water sources include springs, stock tanks, and ponds. This area is sparsely populated,  contains washes, draws, thickets, Shin Oak, and tall grasses.",
