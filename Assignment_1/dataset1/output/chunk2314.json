            "Observed": "It was early bow season around oct 5, 2004 approx 6:30 pm. It was pretty cold and the wind was blowing in all directions. I was sitting in my tree stand on top of a ridge over looking a creek bottom with minimal vegation spaced along it. this area is pretty remote and is a traveling place for our deer. Well it was about dusk when I heard some crows in the tree tops above the creek started to make alot of noise. I then saw three deer running full out down the creek bed, I heard a scream and the a loud thump. two of the deer I saw head in another direction, but the one remained down in the vegatation thrashing around.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. He reiterated that he caught movement out of the corner of his eye and thought it was something man-sized trying to keep in cover. When the witness snapped his head in that direction he caught a glimpse of a face, which he described as unhuman or subhuman. He saw it only briefly \u0096 a second or less. The witness watched the animal react to his sighting of it and then quickly pull back behind a tree. Before his encounter, the witness had never thought about bigfoot beyond having briefly seen something on TV. Since the sighting he has been obsessed with trying to figure out what he saw, and now believes it was a sasquatch.The witness added the smell he ran afoul of was so strong it nearly made him gag on the spot. He said it was the foulest smell he'd ever come across. He also told me that he has never been that frightened before, and he has been in situations where his life has been in immediate danger. However, this encounter tops all, he said.",
