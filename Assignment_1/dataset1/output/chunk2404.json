As I walked through the forest, I found myself looking back over my shoulder for no apparent reason other than feeling like I was being followed.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness who now lives in California by phone for over an hour and can add the following details to his account:The witness was following a clearing under power lines. A creek runs parallel to the lines for a short distance then cuts across the clearing. The animal was crossing near to where the power lines cross the creek. The general area is a patchwork of trees  and clear cuts. The first animal was over 7\u0092 tall with broad shoulders 400 to 500 pounds. It was \u0093thin and muscular\u0094 with a \u0093pipe-like trunk\u0094 and it was covered in black hair that was \u0093not long, maybe four inches\u0094 that appeared \u0093groomed and shiny.\u0094  Although he only saw its face in profile through the scope, he could see some facial skin that also appeared black. It had a pointed head. The animal\u0092s arms were long and the legs appeared like slender human legs. No mammary glands were noted. The animal\u0092s smooth gait was purposeful and its head remained focused forward.  The arms swung, but not overly exaggerated; the posture was bent slightly forward. It took five seconds for the animal to cross approximately seventy five  yards.He wanted it to be a bear but could not convince himself that it was. \u0093No way it\u0092s a bear.\u0094 He thought, \u0093I\u0092m looking at a legend.\u0094  The second animal was a smaller version of the first (about half the size) and walked directly behind. His impression was that they were parent and child. He believes that they knew he and his partner were in the area hunting and the adult was being cautious enough to scout ahead before taking the child across the open ground. At no point did the animals look towards him.The witness was \u0093shook up\u0094 and having a gun did not make him feel safer.  The animals crossed in front of his direction of travel. He was unsure of what to do, so he sat there for over an hour contemplating.  He decided to backtrack and take a different route back to camp where he sat with his rifle on his lap until his partner arrived.  They left the next morning cutting their hunting trip short by three days.Of interest, an hour prior to his sighting the witness came upon a dozen salmon that were lying on the shore up to ten feet away from the creek. \u0093Eggs were scattered on the ground.  Some fish still had eggs in them as I tested.  They did not appear to be eaten on, but some heads were crushed as if they were possibly stepped on.\u0094",

Shortly before 5 on Saturday July 17th, 2004, my husband had gotten up and started his coffee when he started hearing strange noises. He said they sounded like a low cry or calling noise. He said he had never heard anything like it before and so he stepped out the door and thought he would walk down to get the previous days mail and see if he could determine what the noise was.",

He said that it did not sound like a scream but more like a call.The animal was standing upright near the pines and he was able to see it very well.  He estimated its height at between six and seven feet, and of a greyish-brown color.  He did not remember seeing any facial features. When the animal noticed him and ran towards the woods it was behind a row of pine trees. ",
