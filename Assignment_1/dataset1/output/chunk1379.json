            "Observed": "My Wife and I Were traveling yesterday on the Lady of the Lake II out of Chelan Washington.  We were heading from Chelan to Stehekin on the north end of the Lake.  About half way up the lake we were dropping off 70 fire fighters at Lucerne.  Just as the Boat was leaving the landing I saw something large and dark walking on the shore were a creek (I believe it's called Holden creek) runs into the lake.  I saw it for a few seconds and told my wife that I thought I might have Just seen Bigfoot.  I showed her the spot and told her to keep looking while I got the camera.  She said \"I see it\" she said \"it looked like an orangatang but more upright.\"",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking to the witness several times I believe him to be sincere. Immediately upon making contact the witness emailed several pictures to me. Unfortunately the distance from the shore to the \"subject\" severely limits the ability to discern what in fact the creature is, it appears to be nothing more than a \"blobsquatch\" due to the lack of detail. However it appears that the subject is quite tall as it clearly stands well above several large wind fell trees and other bushes on the lake shore. As the witness states in his report the majority of the tour boat's guests where focused on the off loading of fire fighters, they where apparently the only people to notice the animal. This area is extremely remote accessible only by boat or float plane. The likely hood of a hoax is extremely remote.The witness has agreed to send the photos to me with the full files copied onto a CD; this will allow a more detailed examination.Derek Freel",
