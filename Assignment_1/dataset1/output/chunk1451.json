Witnesses are very knowledgeable of all local wildlife and associated sounds. The reporting witness is an Eagle Scout and third generation resident of the ranch. All bigfoot related stories were repeated several times without variance. When you first hear of the location most people scoff at the idea of bigfoot being found in that area as it is thought of as being densely populated. I was impressed with the amount of terrain suitable for hiding and providing a bigfoot. The family ranch is bordered by miles of uninhabited forest.",

At midnight, we were preparing to retire for the night to our respective tents, when we heard a prolonged howl which was about as far away from us as the 1994 Columbiana, OH, howl (on the BFRO website) seemed from its source.  At least, that's the best way I could determine the distance from us.  This howl was at least twice as long (I want to say even longer) as the Columbiana, OH, howl.  I'd estimate the howl we heard to be more or less ten seconds long. It was the length of the call, as much as it was the deep tone and strength of it, which attracted our immediate attention.  It just didn't seem to quit.  It wasn't interrupted, either, like if the creature took a breath and then continued.  This went on continuously for around 10 seconds.",
