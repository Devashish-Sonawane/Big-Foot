            "Follow-Up Report": "[Investigated by Steve Moon. Comments edited by Matt Moneymaker]In 2008 the witness heard what he thinks were two individuals clacking rocks together, signaling each other. The witness stated that he had previously heard the sounds of rocks being smacked together in the quarry area more than once. The sound is of big rocks being banged together, like the sound of a horse on concrete. In that same area he has found really big rocks that have been lifted and turned over.He believes the same animals have used bird-like sounds to signal each other, including the vocal sounds of owls (in the daytime), woodpeckers and hen turkey.  One night as a storm was approaching he crossed the creek and walked about a half mile and heard a hoot owl, then two, and then five to eight howls. One howl was to the south of him, and the others were all to the north, spread in an east to west line, with one very close to him. In 1978 or 1979 when witness was 17 or 18 years old, he was squirrel hunting with friends. He lost track of them, and went back to the truck and found them there. He asked if someone was in the creek. He had heard banging or rocks like a hammer, for about an hour at the creek, and then heard a stone being thrown and then rolling.The witness has been hunting in the area for about 30 years and seems very in tune with its natural features and the animals found there. After speaking with the witness about this incident I concluded that he is a credible observer.The Dekalb Wildlife Management Area is 2,1070 acres, about three quarters of which is timber. There are two streams that bisect the area, numerous inactive rock quarries, and at least one large spring. ----------------------------------------------------Editor's note:  This witness made some astute observations. What he describes, with respect to rock clacking, has been observed (heard) on various other expeditions and field investigations, spanning several years, in different parts of the country with a history of sightings. His assumptions about their purpose, based on their context and circumstances, equate with our own assumptions about their purpose, based on similar contexts and circumstances -- they seem to be made for purpose of signaling other sasquatches that more than one human is not far away.Iowa might not seem like a classic bigfoot area, according to the old thinking about these animals, but the BFRO has accumulated a lot of first-hand observations suggesting that these animals seem to be reported areas with large ungulate populations.  In parts of the western states and western provinces, the most reliable indicator species is elk. In the mid-west and eastern states and provinces the indicator species seems to be whitetail deer. This correlation with ungulate populations was first noted by the BFRO, and continues to serve an important function in selecting expedition locations.Iowa and various other mid-western states have abundant whitetail deer populations, mainly due to the amount of agriculture in those states, and the amount of acorn-bearing oak hardwood  trees.",

The first incident was at 7:30 p.m., while he was collecting wood for a campfire. He stated that he and a friend heard an extremely loud vocalization from beyond a rise in a field, which unnerved them. They were shaken and decided not to remain in that area any longer. The two returned to the camp and found the other hunters who were with them had heard the same sound.A series of the vocalizations continued for some time. The witness and his friends heard multiple sources of vocalizations throughout the night. The hunters also heard sounds of rocks being knocked together. Some noises were within 100 feet of the campfire. Whatever made the sounds never came close enough for the group to see it. ",
