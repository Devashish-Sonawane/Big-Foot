            "Follow-Up Report": "This track (though questionable as to why being singular in context) has a similar shape to three 19\" tracks found in a permanent study site nearby. It has a heel width that seems rather narrow in proportion to the rest of the foot, but that is also a characteristic of the other three 19\" tracks found. It is also an undocumented trait described as often being observed with the largest of tracks, according to some experts.Photo credit: H. H.I don't really have a problem with there only being one track since the discoverers were not specifically trying to find more. Other pictures from the witness shows that there was even more forest leaves over the most likely spot for the next track. They just didn't clear them away to the soil underneath. These leaves appear fresher, meaning only in regards to their deposit at the site; they appear crisper, not as water logged, curled away from the ground, non-typical moving water deposit.It looks like there are toe impression details on the front of the track. The large big toe is in keeping with what we've seen on tracks we believe to be genuine... a very big toe pad area yet it has a 2-3-1-4-5 toe length index.There appears to be weight shifting in the creation of this track, but the release points are all but hidden without seeing the track in person. The push out of mud all the way around the track is interesting in that it tells us something about how the track maker must have been walking. It looks like a very deliberate foot placement; I see no heel drag or telltale claw marks as if from a bear.The track appears to have been impressed in a very wet area (an intermittently filled channel within an old road) containing a lot of silt and an anaerobic environment which has led to the preservation of a large amount of old leaves.  New spring leaves have fallen into the track. Best guess would be that the impression was made when the mud/soil was a bit wetter.The track find was at around 3280 feet in elevation. The track was about 3/4\" deep but the toes were deeper, around 1 1/2\".Right now I would have to lean towards this being a real track and that of being from a Sasquatch.Richard Noll / OC",

The witness emphasized that, as a professional driver, he is very attentive to the road. He and another bus and driver had just dropped off their charter group in Cortez and were in the vicinity of Mancos at the time of the sighting. There were no passengers on the busses and the other driver following behind did not see the reported crossing. It was shortly after sunset but still light enough to see when the witness saw a figure dash quickly across the road at a distance of approximately 150 yards ahead. The figure was on two legs, entirely dark colored, noticeably large and muscular in shape, appeared taller than a normal person and was seen for only two or three seconds at most.  There was thick woods on both sides of the road and nothing of the figure could be seen when he reached the crossing point. He also noticed a large herd of elk shortly before this sighting. He speculated that the deer-whistles on the front of the bus may have alerted or spooked the creature. His immediate thought was \"My God, I think I just saw a bigfoot or something!\"David Petti",
