            "Observed": "One afternoon I was riding my bike on my grandfather's farm through an alfalfa field. I was approaching a small crest on a hill and started coasting down. About 300 feet away to my left I noticed this huge hair covered creature coming up the hill towards the cornfield. When it noticed me, it stopped and turned back towards the woodline. I stopped my bike and watched as it went down the hill into the woods. When I stopped, it swung its body to look at me. Then, it started to run down the hill and out of sight. When it went down the hill it stumbled and made a strong grunt like noise. I rode back to the house as fast as I could to tell everyone what I just saw. My grandparents didn't believe me and said I was just seeing things.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The area where the sighting took place is a small valley with a creek running through it. There is thick woods on both sides of the creek and it goes on for miles heading south down into the Mohican drainage area. The witness noticed a bump like head and estimated it had to weigh well over 500 pounds. He thinks it was heading towards a grown up cornfield until it saw him riding his bike. On the other side of the cornfield is a small wooded area with a good size pond.   ",
