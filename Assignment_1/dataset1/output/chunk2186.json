            "Observed": "6/17/13- Salt Fork State Park Bigfoot Ridge. Me and my girlfriend went to bed at about 10pm. Off and on we heard really weird loud screams. At about 1 am she woke me up in terror because it was outside our tent just feet from our heads pulling handfuls of grass. She was frozen with fear and waited for it to walk away. When it did she opened the tent where she heard twigs cracking and shined the flashlight in that direction when she saw its really big yellow eyes. They were close together and it turned towards the wooded tree line. We believe it watched us grab our stuff and end the trip early. We left our tent and hauled it out of there fast. We are completely traumatized over the experience and would like to talk to someone who believes. We also believe we attracted it because I was knocking trees just after sunset.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After interviewing the main witness and having multiple conversations, I'm convinced that in fact something did occur that night on and around the campsite. The fear and tone of their voices was quite compelling. She was awakened by something walking around their tent and making a sound similar to tearing out long grass. She listened for a short period of time while trying to wake up her boyfriend by nudging him. The walking sound became faint and then became quiet. She opened the tent door and crawled out with flashlight on and in hand scanning the surrounding area while on all fours. Towards the wood line, there was an area of tall reeds that led up to the forest. When her light shined in that direction, she clearly saw two large, yellowish golf ball sized eyes looking in her direction standing in the reeds. Within seconds, the large eyes turned towards the forest and disappeared making just a little noise on its departure. After seeing and hearing this, she panicked and abruptly awoke her boyfriend to the point that they were both became quite concerned on what was out there. The boyfriend, who is six foot five, shined the flashlight in the woods and had his sidearm (has Concealed Carry Permit) ready while his girlfriend went to get their vehicle and drive it back to the camp site. He could hear foot falls at what he estimated was 100 feet into the woods. Once there, they quickly threw everything in the vehicle and drove straight home at around 2 AM leaving their tent. They were the only tent at the Primitive Campground and were very shaken up by the whole experience. They joked around earlier in the evening and made wood knocks since the campground was called \"Bigfoot Ridge\". I asked the witness if the eye shine was a possible owl and she said absolutely not. She could faintly hear it walk away when it turned towards the wood line and stated there were no trees within 30 feet from where she could see it standing. She also stated that compared to her rather tall boyfriend the thing she saw was much taller and most definitely wider. They also had a dog with them but noted it was acting quite strange while tied up close to the wood line. After watching the dogs behavior, they decided to put the dog in the vehicle before they went to bed. The dog did not bark the entire night once in the vehicle. ",
