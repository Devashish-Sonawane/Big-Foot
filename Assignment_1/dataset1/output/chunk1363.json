            "Also Noticed": "We then continued on to Fox Island which is about 200 yards from the sighted critter and only about 50 feet from the mainland and chatted for a bit.  Eventually we got the charcoal grill fired up and proceeded to cook a traditional meal of dogs and beans, of course with the appropriate condiments.  We do this on a regular basis on the islands of the lake.  As we were eating, we both had a weird feeling so we QUICKLY finished our meal, loaded the gear back on the boat and left or as some may say, got the hell out of Dodge.  We've never had that type of experience on the lake before and are not sure if the two events are related.  I've recently become aware that some folks have a theory about how our favorite mystery creature may use/communicate with infrasound which could explain that feeling we both had.",
