            "Observed": "I was just out for a walk up in the hills from our house that is about two miles out of town in the woods (where we have heard some strange howls before in the summer) and I was about three miles from the house in the hills down the valley when I came across a set of prints on the ground about 15-17 inch long on pretty wide with a set of toes, I step on one before i realized what they were and so I took a couple of photos",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Over the phone, the witness explained that it had snowed a few days before he found the tracks. The weather had then warmed and froze again, causing the snow to melt slightly and become crusty on top. He stated that this old logging area was covered with animal prints of many types, but no evidence of human presence was noted. Other animals walking in the same place ruined many prints. He was able to distinguish three good prints that were made by a large bi-pedal animal. Toes were clearly visible. The witness's size 13 boot was dwarfed by these prints, fitting completely inside with much room to spare in length and width. The snow melting and then re-freezing probably enlarged the prints somewhat, but their considerable size still rules out a barefoot human.As soon as the witness\u0092s photographs are developed, he will make them available to the BFRO.UPDATE 1/07: Here are the witness' photos. The witness and his father have also heard several loud calls coming from the same approximate area since last summer. These calls sounded close to the presumed sasquatch calls on the BFRO website.",

            "Observed": "In October of 1987 a friend and I went camping just outside of Kingsbury Ordinance Plant (KOP for short) in Kingsbury, IN. We were about 1 to 11/2 miles off Hupp rd (which is the road the enters KOP). We set up camp just before dark around 6 pm or so. After about 45 min, my friend went home to eat dinner and call another friend of ours to come out when he gets off duty. Just around dusk, while getting fire started, I heard rustling in woods about 25 yards away. I didn't think anything of it at the time and because of the population of Deer out in that area, I thought it might be one. After about 10 minutes, heard noise again, but it was about 15 yards away this time. I yelled HEY real load and the noise stopped for about 5 minutes. Then I heard grunting about same distance away. Getting nervous, I yelled again Knock it off. I then picked up a stick and said, I have a gun. The noise stopped after 3 or 4 sec and as I turned to look at fire, I heard a loud thump to my right. I looked and saw a large tree stump that landed about 8 ft away. I turned around and faced woods and yelled very loudly Knock it off or  I'll shoot. I then saw another large log come sailing through the air toward my direction and land about 3 feet in front of me and about 5 feet to left. I started running down a trail toward the road. I did not hear anything for about the first 100 yards, and then I heard rocks moving as if someone was running in the same direction as I, but they were on the RR tracks to my left. The sounds of the steps were about 1 sec. apart. I heard this for about 8 to 10 sec. then it stopped. I ran for about 25 more yards and stopped. It was dark and overcast skies, but still there was enough light to see where I was running. I turned and looked behind me and then to my left and saw nothing. I then turned back toward the road and focused on the street light ahead. Walking very fast now, I came to a dip in the trail. This is where I saw it, a large figure standing in front of me. The dip in the trail sloped down to about 3 feet deep and ran the depth for about 30 ft. then it rose again to ground level. The figure was standing in the center of the dip in the trail and stood at the same height as myself. I am 5'9\" so I the figure had to be from 8 to 9 feet tall. This thing let out the most God forsaking scream, that it would make your blood curdle. I did what any normal person would have done; I took off running toward my right through an open field. I ran as fast as I could away from this figure. I finally reached my friends front steps about 3/4 miles away. At first I thought it was him, but when he came to door he had been eating dinner, his shoes where off, and his mom said that he had not left the house.  After he ate and our other friend arrived we all went back out there about 3 hours later. The small tent we put up had been tore down and logs and stump that were thrown were lying in the spots that they landed.",
