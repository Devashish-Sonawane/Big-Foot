I\u2019m not sure if this one is true (story from a friend of a friend), the guy was driving down a logging road and saw 2 guys walking down the road, which is very unusual in the middle ofthe woods, they were very scared and had only a fifth of whiskey with them, they claimed to be camping and something threw huge rocks at their campfire, after multiple attempts the fire was put out, the 2 guys took of running leaving everything including vehicles behind, the person that picked up hese 2 brought the 2 back to the site and found multiple huge rocks on their vehicles, some of these rocks took all three of them to lift off. These are the two more significant stories from around here (about everyone that has spent much time in the woods around here has a story, usually these stories are of personal experience, problem is most won't talk about it).",
