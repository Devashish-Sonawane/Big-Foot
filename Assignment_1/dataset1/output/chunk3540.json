            "Observed": "On Tuesday (Dec. 4th, 2012) I woke up to my dogs alarm barking out in their outside kennel.  I grabbed a large flashlight on my way to the back door.  I was most worried about it being a skunk that was causing the dogs to bark, as I have noticed once in a great while, that I have caught the scent of a skunk early in the morning or in the middle of the night when I have stepped outside to quiet the dogs and I didn\u0092t want to surprise one myself.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness lives in a small development near Kamiah, Idaho with her teenaged son. She trains rescue dogs and has several in kennels that are kenneled about 15 feet from the house.On the night of December 4, 2012, the witness woke to her three dogs barking. She got up to quiet them as she did not want them disturbing the neighbors. When she opened the back door, she immediately smelled a very strong \u0093skunky\u0094 smell.  She assumed there was a skunk bothering the dogs.  She was able to quiet the dogs, and noticed they kept looking toward the back of the house.About 15 minutes later the dogs began barking again. She went outside again, noticed the smell was still there, but the dogs were now looking at the driveway.  This time, she could not quiet them but suddenly they ran into their dog houses and stopped barking. She had never experienced this behavior with them. She got a flashlight to see if it was a skunk, deer, or elk that was bothering them. She saw movement near her apple and plum tree which is about 30 feet from the door, and shined it in that direction.She describes what she saw, \u0093At first I thought I was looking at a big person wearing shredded clothes. The shreds were not even \u0096 they were shaggy and silvery in color.\u0094  When it moved, she realized it was not a large person. It took two big steps, upright, that took it out of her beam of light. She then tried to follow it with the light as it ran with its arms swinging in a very fast but fluid movement up a small hill on the road, and with a leap it left the road into a briar that borders an old orchard. Before it made the leap, she could tell it turned its body to look at her over its shoulder.Photo of the road it ran down:Photo of the briar:She never got a clear view of its face. She was only able to see it from the rear view and side view. Her older son is 6.5 feet tall and when she had him try to recreate the event; she was able to tell the creature was much bigger than him. She estimates it was no less than 7 1/2 feet tall. The body build was \u0093substantial\", it was by no means lean, nor overweight.Photo of the tree it stood behind. Her younger son who stands 5'6'' is in the photo, behind the tree:This is her younger son standing in front of the tree with his arm held up holding a ruler at 8 ft.: Although she describes the hair as shaggy and unkempt, she claims it was about \u00bd the length of the ghillie suit her son owns.  The moon out that night was a waning gibbous and had 71% illumination. She described the sasquatch as looking \u0093silvery\u0094 in color which she thinks could have been attributed to the moon\u0092s brightness. If the creature had been dark, even with the moon light, it would have appeared darker in color. I would conclude that this creature probably was lighter in color than darker.With further investigation, I was able to discover that the development was once an orchard. Her property alone has six apple trees and six plum trees, and although it was winter, there was still a lot of fruit on the trees in the neighborhood. She smelled the \u0093skunky\u0094 smell several days before her encounter, and attributed it to skunks. Earlier in the month, something had been getting into her trash, although there were no teeth marks in the bags. They had been pulled open, but a mess was not left behind. The skunky  smell lingered, so she assumed it was skunks, although she had not seen one.  At one time, she had to move the dog bowls into a more interior part of the kennel as she discovered the bowls had been turned over and the kibble spilled outside of the kennels.  (The kennels are completely enclosed, but it would have been possible for something to reach inside to grab the food in the bowls.) She has smelled that smell several times since, the last time being in February.  Interestingly, around this time the deer, elk and other animals move up unto the mountains as the snow is melting.Google earth image of the area:",

            "Observed": "The first time my father and I were going up on a ridge to listen for some turkeys, when all of a sudden out of a pine thicket about 900 yards away, we heard something let out this awful noise. At first we were shocked, then scared because we had never heard this sort of noise before. It made this noise two seperate times, and we left and headed home and didnt think anything of it. About three months after that took place my friends and me thought we would drive through the road just to look around, it was about 11:00 p.m. and sort of foggy,we were just driving along when my cousin noticed two red eyes on a bank. I thought it was a racoon until the thing blinked and walked acrossed the road in front of us about 100 yds. up the road. The creature walked upright on two legs and stood about 6'10. We locked the doors and drove off as the creature disappeared into a heavily timbered thicket. A year later which was on Aug. 10 of 98, just a day ago , my sisters and two of my friends got in his truck and decided to go look for some deer. We ended up going down the same road where we had seen and the creature the previous year. The girls were riding in the back just talking to each other when my youngest screamed out. I turned around just in time to see the figure of something standing about thirty yards behind the truck. I grabbed the spotlight and swung it around only to find that the thing had disappeared into the woods.",
