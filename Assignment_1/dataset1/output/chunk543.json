            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the father-in-law by phone and even though this incident took place some 30 years ago, the events are still fresh in his mind. He even recalled the name of the wildlife officer that called him to say they retrieved the body.It was between 7-8:00pm and had just got dark. The witness was driving alone in his Grand Torino on Roddy Hwy and was just about to cross a small bridge when a 5' tall creature emerged from the right and ran on two legs into the road. The witness at this point corrected his daughter-in-laws previous description of a 6-7' tall animal. He was traveling at approx. 50 mph, and it was a clear evening with no fog. The witness stated several times that this creature was definitely running on two legs. The animal ran directly in front of his vehicle. He hit it squarely in the center of his grill and hit it quite hard. Not a glancing blow. The impact knocked the creature off the road, and over to the side of the road. The witness got out of the vehicle, walked over to the creature and was amazed at what he was looking at.  He described as at first looking like a mixture of three or four different animals. It had the coarse hair of a boar, but it was multi-colored. Grey, brown, white, and black were the prominent colors. He did notice no visible tail. It looked to weigh approx. 70/80 lbs, it had a long snout with fangs that protruded out of its mouth. The front quarters ended in paws like a kangaroo (not hands). The witness stated it definitely ran out on two legs, and it was not hopping. It looked like a mixture of a wolf, a boar, a man, and a bear. Several people came out of their homes to see the creature for themselves.  Other people who drove by the spot also saw the creature. The area locals spoke about this incident for many years. The creature laid there on the side of the road, overnight, until early the next morning, when he received a call from the wildlife officer saying they had picked up the animal and were disposing of it. They never spoke about what it might have been. The conversation was all business. Efforts to locate the officer, ended with the discovery of his passing in 2016, and his wife, a few years before. They had no children.  The witness stated that before he hit and killed this animal, there was much discussion in the area concerning very unusual livestock kills. Individuals were losing pigs, cows, calves, and horses to an unknown animal. The witness sent me his sketch:",

            "Observed": "My friend and I had been searching for a place called Dickerson quarry in Dickerson Md, and had just located it on a map. We had to park on some railroad tracks by the aquaduct and walk through some very dense sticker bushes and overgrowth to find the place. To describe the quarry, it is located in the middle of the woods. It is about 75 yards long and about 30 yards wide with very tall cliffs, about 50 to 80 feet tall in some places. However there are a few places where you can walk down to the waters edge. As we were approaching the quarry, we heard this very loud screeching sound coming from about 25 yards away in the overgrowth. It was very loud and it actually startled us when it first started. The only way to describe the sound would be to say it sounded like a pig getting slaughtered. We stopped walking and waited but it stopped, whatever it was. We continued walking and found the quarry, hearing the strange sound several more times, always coming from a different place. We made a survey and located a place to go down to the waters edge to sit and rest. As we made our way around the quarry we heard the screaming again. Actually coming from the area where we wanted to go! We were not too alarmed though, being curious and stupid. We made it to the waters edge and sat down and started to look around and check the place out. I had picked up a stick off the ground and got out my pocket knife and started to carve on the wood. Suddenly there was a very large splash in the water. It sounded like a person had just jumped in but when I looked up could see ripples in the water where something had gone in. Figuring it was a rock falling from the cliffs we began talking again. About 5 minutes elapsed and we heard another splash. This one bigger and it was very far away from the edge. I asked my freind \"Did you throw something in?\". He said no, he was looking at me. We looked around to see if anyone was there that we didnt see but there was no one anywhere. We sat for about 5 more minutes talking and then heard another big splash. Neither of us saw what made it but the disturbance in the water was so big we guessed it had to be something big! We started to think that someone was in the woods and didnt want us trespassing and was trying to scare us off. However as we started to really think, we became aware there was no way anyone could throw any rock that big, that far. So we made the choice to go ahead and leave. As we were climbing up and out of the quarry another splash came from very near where we had been sitting and also sounded very big. We reached the top and started to make our way to the car. We only walked about 20 feet when something came crashing through the tree branches and hit the ground near us very hard. It sounded like a 20 pound rock hitting the ground. At that point we both stopped walking and turned and really looked hard into the woods. Neither of us saw anything. As we stood there listening, I swear Ive never heard the woods more quite in my life.  We started to walk again and the objects being thrown at us started to get alot more accurate. I remember saying to my freind \"What the hell is going on?\" His response was to tell me GO!!! We took off running and reached our only real obsticle, a creek about 10 feet wide where we had to cross on a log. I went first and he was close behind. As we where halfway across the log something landed in the creek about 5 feet from me that had to be the size of a paint bucket.",
