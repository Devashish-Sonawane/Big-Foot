            "Observed": "We were there @8 days. First two days & nights were fine. After that we started hearing what sounded like a lady moaning or \"howling\" across the field. Also tree knocks in the far tree line across the field. It seemed like it would happen in one spot & then another would respond in another area. The next couple nights it seemed to get closer until it sounded like it was in the woods right behind our tent. (Very loud knocks, usually 2 at a time.) Also got growled at 4 times from right outside the tent one night maybe @ the sixth night. We stormed out of tent with guns & flashlights & didn't see anything & didn't hear anything running away! Also during the day after hunting we came back to find a smaller tree with full fresh rootball placed across the entrance to our camp site. (It wasn't dragged there, there was no dirt drag marks anywhere & we looked around & couldn't find where it was pulled from. There were also some other big limbs placed there too. (I have pics of the tree.). Keep in mind there was no other campers or hunters in the whole valley the whole week.)",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.The witness and his hunting partner left after work on Friday, October 13th to get to this camp. The witness did not record the daily events, but following is the sequence of events as best recalled by him. I will start with Saturday, October 14th as day one. Day One and Two: Nothing happened.Day Three: That night they heard moaning that sounded like a lady moaning. It lasted for about ten seconds. This happened two times from same location. The witness does not recall how much time between the moans. They were awakened by tree knocks sometime between 3 to 4 o clock in the morning. Two knocks came from the south and two in response from the north. Day Four: That night, they heard moaning again. Also same pattern of knocks in early morning hours.Day Five: When returning to camp from hunting, they found a twenty foot long tree and two sticks placed across entrance to camp. It was four to five inches diameter at bottom. The root ball was eighteen inches with roots extending out to twenty four inches. No drag marks were present. See photos:Wood knocks happened again in early morning hours that awakened the hunters. The knocks were closer. Day Six: That night, growls were heard. The witness describes them as a deep \"errrrr.\" Both hunters rushed out of the tent and watched with flashlights for twenty minutes. Again wood knocks in the early morning hours that seemed just behind their tent. Day Seven: Upon returning to camp, they found a thirty foot long tree down in their camp. I was twelve to eighteen inches diameter and appeared snapped off at the ground. See photos:His partner was very nervous and they did not feel safe. Each night their sleep was interrupted by wood knocks. The witness said, \"they felt pressured to leave.\" They tried to sleep but were too stressed and drove to a family cabin. Day Eight: When they returned that morning, they found the tent zipper as the witness described. The lantern was still on inside. No food had been in the tent. Throughout this time, they looked for footprints but the ground was too hard in the area. They did not detect any foul odor.They only saw one other camper and that was when they were leaving. There was only one windy day and he believes it was day four. He said two years ago, a large fire was in the area that destroyed a lot of habitat. The witness refers to hearing \"talking\" in prior years. Once, his brother-in-law described hearing mumbling or talking in the distance. Another time, his hunting partner said it sounded like a crazy old lady talking in the field. I find the witness very observant and credible.   ",
