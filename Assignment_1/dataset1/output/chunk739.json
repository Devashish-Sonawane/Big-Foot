I was told that they had another possible encounter shortly after 10/24/05 after the last hurricane came through.The wife also added they had heard howling and wood knocks. They didn't mention this initially,  thinking that they had nothing to do with the encounter.The husband noted that their dog, whom he said was very hard to spook, had cowered on the porch when the wife had seen the creature.This location will be checked out by Florida BFRO investigators.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------11/26/05:The couple contacted me about a hog hunting trip the day before Thanksgiving. While hunting about a half of a mile into the woods behind their house they experienced wood knocks and a bluff charge, but never saw the creature.They also told me about their neighbors hearing whoops on several different nights.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1/7/06:Myself and another BFRO investigator visited the sites where the witnesses had their encounters. While we didn't see anything out of the ordinary, we did hear moans off in the distance and a howl further off in the distance later that night. ",
