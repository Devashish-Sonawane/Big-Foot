When I went out there she was gone. There was no sign that she had been drug to where she was at. She had been carried approx 120 yards then laid down and she was not torn apart like coyotes. I have been in the woods all my life and never seen anything like it. I had a very eerie feeling and decided to get out of there and haven't been back there after dark since.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness via phone. Very polite, matter of fact, and a true hunter and tracker all his life. As stated, he left his kill overnight to retrieve it in the morning. He left it for several reasons. He had to be somewhere and was running late, he was not concerned about it disappearing, and he knows that if the body freezes, or gets close to freezing, the hide comes off much easier. He has never had a kill scavenged or stolen.When he went to the location it was left at, it was gone. He went back home and grabbed a 22 rifle and went back out to find his kill. He followed the tree line for about 120-150 yards and this was where he noticed the bent branches of the tree line 6 feet or so above the ground. He found his kill. The neck was broken, the chest cavity torn (not cut) open, and the only organs remaining were the stomach, and small and large intestines. He had never seen anything like it before, and he has been a woodsman all his life. The animal was shot at 75 yards with a .308 caliber bullet with a ballistic tip. The deer dropped where it was standing. There was no way it broke its neck in that instance. He could not explain how the neck got broken, nor the organs removed. He had a feeling something was watching him as he was leaning over his kill, and he decided to leave the kill and area at once. And, as stated, never went back. He also stated that his grandpa told him, as he has for years, that there are things in the woods you don't want to be around after dark. He left it at that. He has, on previous occasions, found three other deer skeletons and the leg bones were missing. One skeleton even had a nice rack intact. He fanned out in 5-10-15-20 and 25 ft circles to see if he could find the legs. None were found. He found it odd and unusual. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On November 23, 2004 I had a frank conversation with D.M. about his face-to-face encounter with what I believe was a sasquatch.  At the time he had no idea what he was looking at, except that it wasn\u0092t a bear.  He defined the creature that he encountered back in 1976 in very definitive terms, and this encounter has had a profound effect on his life ever since.  D.M. had nightmares for maybe five years after his encounter.  He even had a rough time going over his story with me while we were discussing it over the phone, and that was twenty-eight years ago.I asked D.M. what I considered to be some pertinent questions that he didn\u0092t quite answer in his report:Q:  Was it covered in hair, and could you see what color it was?  A:  \u0093It was covered with a very dark hair, because the light from the kitchen light was kind of lighting it up. The kitchen window was quite large, something like you might find in a dining room.\u0094Q:  What would you estimate its height and weight to have been? A:  \u0093I looked at the bush it was standing behind the following day, and it was a little taller than me, and I was about 5\u0092 7\u0094 at the time (I am now 6\u0092 5\u0094), so I could see its chest, shoulders, head and arms. So, I estimated its height at eight foot plus.  I will estimate its weight at five times heavier than myself, which would put it over five hundred pounds.\u0094Q:  Did you see any facial features, and can you describe them?  A:  \u0093I noticed the nose as not being pushed up or turned up like a gorillas. I didn\u0092t look at his face for very long, especially at its eyes, because they frightened me, so I concentrated more on its arms, hands and its massive shoulders.\u0094Q:  Could you describe the arms, and could you tell if it was a male or female?     A:  \u0093The reason that I looked at the arms the longest was the fact that its hands had thumbs, and the chest was large but flat like a male would have been.\u0094Q:  Did it ever make any noise, and did you ever look for prints?  A:  \u0093No noise was heard from the creature.  We--my friend his father--and myself went over the area the next morning. I pointed out the bush it was standing by, but no prints were observed.\u0094I received the following e-mail message on the evening of November 26, 2004.  I followed the directions and found a very interesting site (http://home.comcast.net/~paul.smith7/sas.htm).Richard, I got back home today and was on the Internet site Bigfoot Forums, and there's a new topic in the media section on Bigfoot Art!! If you go to the post where you can link to Paul Smith's site there is a picture of just a face. THAT\u0092S EXACTLY WHAT I SAW!! You take away the bush from around the sides and top. The next picture is of a Bigfoot standing in the Hoh Rain Forest.  The upper body matches except the shoulders were more rounded instead of squared off. I hope this helps paint a better picture than my conversation with you.  In summary, after a very believable interview with D.M., I am convinced that he had a face-to face encounter with a sasquatch in the San Bernardino National Forest back in 1976.  If you have time, check out some of the media articles on the BFRO site, Los Angeles County back in 1973, and note the distance between the Antelope Valley and Big Bear Lake.On a good day, we can almost see it from here!",
