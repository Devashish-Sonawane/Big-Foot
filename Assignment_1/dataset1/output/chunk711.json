We had just finished eating a steak and baked potato dinner around the campfire and were talking when we heard a loud \"bang\" sound that sounded similar to when you set a large round log on top of another for splitting.  It was only estimated to be about 50-60 yards away and very loud.  We are all experienced woodsmen and the noise was enough for all of us to grab our spotlights and guns and face that direction as we had never heard anything like that before.  After about 5 minutes we sat back down and were discussing the sound when it happened again just as loud.  At this point we discussed all three sleeping in the truck to be safe that night.  We stayed up late that night and did not hear it again...but we all slept with our weapons loaded and at the ready every night after.   In the morning I went and looked for any tracks but could not find any as the snow had melted and the ground was saturated with pine needles and leaves.",

A little breeze was blowing campfire smoke and the odor of their meal to the south. From that direction, and across the creek, came a loud wood whack. The witness had never heard that sound, it was not antlers clashing together. After five to ten minutes, they heard the same sound again. There was two inches of snow on the ground, they did not hear any footfalls.He thought the sounds were meant to intimidate them. There was patchy bushes on the other side of the creek and the witness said something could have easily been watching them from the bushes. The witness, an avid hunter, has seventeen years in law enforcement and six years in the army. I find him very credible.   ",
