            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with this witness over the phone initially.  He re-told what he experienced that night.  He said that he was in a sound sleep, when a he heard a super loud scream that awoke him.  He had never heard something like that before.  He felt that the being that was screaming was 20 feet outside his window. While he laid there in bed, it screamed four more times before he got up to see if he could see what it was.  He moved from his bedroom to the next room, near the back door, where he thought he should be able to see it.  When he looked outside, the animal had moved into the woods about 60 feet away.  It was then that he heard another creature call to the first one.  The one near his house vocalized back in what sounded like a combination of a scream/bark/yelp.  He said that it sounded like something injured.  It also was reported to sound like some kind of talk.  The vocalization sounded very strong. This back and forth screaming between the two went on for about a half an hour.  During that time, the two moved off to the north until he could not hear them anymore.  He said that the dogs were very frightened and were huddling by the sliding door on the opposite side of the house, and that they were not acting the way they normally did when deer, elk, bear, or cougar come into the yard.  Usually, the dogs give chase.  In this case, they acted very afraid.  It was very dark that night. Site investigation.  I met the witness at his home about mid-morning.  He introduced me to his wife.  I also met the dogs. Talking with the witness and his wife, they told of the events again, this time showing me where things happened.   I took photographs of the scene.  We walked the property, and the trails. We also went across the road to the south to observe his undeveloped tract of forest.  We found no possibly sasquatch related structures, rock piles, track lines, or hair.This photograph shows the witness standing where he believes a sasquatch was standing when the first vocalizations were heard.  His bedroom is at the corner of the house, and the window that he looked out of is next to his room. This photograph shows the wood line at the edge of the yard where the animal was reported to have moved to when the witness looked out the window.  This picture is taken from the approximate location of the creature, and looks north. Notice the stones piled up at the edge of the yard. Additional points of interest:1. They have about 40 barn cats.  I stood in one place and saw 7 of them. This could be a food source, and they said that at certain times of the year, quite a few of the cats vanish.2. There is a cougar that comes by the property once each year at the same time.3. At the edges of the lawn, they have piled stones one on top of the other. We have seen piles like these and believe them to be sasquatch related. They are something that might mean something to a sasquatch. These can be seen in the third photograph.4. In the forest to the west of the house they have cut trails that are oriented north-south.5. In this forest, they have placed gnome statues, dolls, and balls in, on, and around stumps.  These could be perceived by sasquatches as offerings.6. Back in 1996, when their son was 5 years old, he came into the house very frightened saying that he saw a huge monkey with purple eyes in the woods.7. Other people who used to live there reported that people had seen sasquatches there back in the 1980s8. If one looks at a Google Earth image of the property and the surrounding area, it is clear that this is most likely a route for sasquatches traveling from the low-lands back to the Cascades in the spring without being seen. They would almost have to pass this location.  9. The witness owns about 10 acres adjoining the parcel on which his house is located, that are dense woods and completely undeveloped.  A sasquatch or several could hang out there and never be discovered.I found the witness and his wife to be genuine, honest, nice people.  I have no reason to doubt that he heard a large creature screaming from close by his house.  His account of the encounter was consistent each time he told me of it.  There were no red flag items at all.  Most significant are the closeness of the suspected sasquatch, and the duration of the vocalizations.  Since the witness was not able to actually see what was making the vocalizations, we can not say for sure that it was a sasquatch.  Looking at the behavior of the creatures, as well as the type and volume of the vocalizations, it is very likely that it was a pair of sasquatches he heard that night. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for approximately thirty minutes about her experience. She spent thirty years of her life growing up in South Mississippi and she is employed as a nurse. The first thing she saw was a \u0093creature in the road\u0094 that was \u0093traveling from the middle of the road to the left side of the road\u0094. When she first spotted the animal, it was already in the process of walking across the road. She said it definitely turned to look at them after it completed the road crossing. She said the first thing she thought was that she was looking at a bigfoot. She estimates it was at least seven feet tall,  or at least \u0093taller than any person I've ever seen\u0094. The closest point she came to the animal was 20 - 25 feet. The duration of the observation at that close range was about five seconds. It was medium-brown in color. She emphasized that it was not black or dark brown. She could not estimate the length of the hair. Rather, she said it was \u0093matted, almost like dreadlocks\u0094. She went on to say that the hair on the top half of the body was \u0093matted all over\u0094, but she was not able to see the lower part of until it was further away. Hence, she is not sure if the hair on the lower part was matted as well. It did have a \u0093very muscular build\u0094, which led her to assume that it was male. She could not discern the details of the face, except that the eyes were dark. She did not smell anything unusual. Please refer to Report #13918, which is the driver's observation in Report #13918.There are several other reports from Clarke and Lauderdale counties, which border one another:Report #1342Report #4681Report #12290Report #13347",
