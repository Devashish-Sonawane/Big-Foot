            "Observed": "I will start with what happened back in the late 1970's.  My husbands uncle and a friend were frog gigging on this farm, that we have now lived on for the last 10 years. (It is my father-in-laws land, which has been in the family for over 30 years.)  He said that they just crossed the creek that is directly behind our mobile home (of course our home wasn't here at the time!).  They heard a noise about 30 feet down the creek. It was nightime, so they shined their lights in the direction of the noise.  They saw a animal creature bending down at the creek, drinking water out of its hands. The \"animal\" stood up, on two legs like a man, was gray, and hairy all over.  It then took off up the holler, running on two legs like a man.  It was no bear.  A bear wouldn't run like a human does. My husbands uncle and friend immediately left, they were so scared.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "     A lengthy phone conversation produced a much more detailed look at the numerous encounters in the area.  Terrain is very difficult, and neighbors are sparse.  The nearest neighbor is 2 miles as the crow flies, 5 miles by road.     We are maintaining contact and she has kept me up-to-date on new occurances.       Also, the report submitter has given me her husband's uncle's phone number.  I've spoken with his wife, and am waiting for contact with him directly.  At that point this class \"B\" report will most likely be reclassified to class \"A\".",
