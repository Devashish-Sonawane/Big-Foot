            "Observed": "My hunting buddy dropped me off at the hunting camp entrance.  I was not going to go into the hunting camp, rather decided to hunt along the railroad track bordering the camp along dirt road. We were probably 3 miles deep in a wooded area off main road.  I positioned myself on edge of railroad, with the tracks and very, very thick forrest and swamp bottoms directly in front of me. I had been watching for deer for maybe 30 minutes, when directly in front of me in the thicket maybe 100 feet, sound began to develop.  It was louder than anything I'd ever heard in the wild.  It sounded like a very deep growl/exhale that lasted what seemed like 20 seconds. It happened a second time about a minute later.  This time it sounded closer, but I couldn't see anything in the thicket.  I remember thinking I probably wasn't armed with enough firepower, although I was holding a 30-30 highpower rifle in my hand.  I felt as though whatever was making the noise was big and strong based on the powerful noise I was hearing.  I started walking toward where my friend was parked.  He met me walking the dirt road and picked me up.  I told him what I'd heard; he laughed and made jokes.  We left the area and didn't return until next year to do some scouting in the exact same area.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone for some length. During our conversation he was able to recount the incidents with excellent detail, and remembered them as if they happened a week ago. His telling of the incidents was calm and forthright and lacked any sensationalism. I found him to be very credible. Being an experienced hunter and outdoorsman, with particular knowledge of the area of the incidents, lends to his credibility. In addition, the witness shared first hand knowledge of other encounters that occurred in the area. He received this information from two other reputable individuals that he personally knows. Also, more recently in the fall of 2006 in neighboring Jefferson County, an encounter occurred. It is listed as report #26393. The location of this incident is on the edge of the same hunting camp that the witness had his encounters.",
