            "Observed": "I looked out the window and saw some monkey looking thing.  It was about 100 yards away.  It was jogging toward the mountains east of where I was.  It was black and looked like it had short fur.  It wasn't very tall.  Maybe four feet.  It kind of ran like a monkey.  You know how monkeys run on their hands sort of crouched over.  I watched for about a minute until it went down into a ditch.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness' father submitted a report, report 23917, previous to the son submitting this report. That report took place near the location of this report and involved the father and a co-worker hearing the loud snap of a breaking limb \u0096 which scared the two men sufficiently that they left the area. In that report, under the heading \u0093Other Stories\u0094, the witness' father made the following statement: \u0093There is another event that I also would have never dreamed was remotely related to bigfoot until I got on the BFRO website. I don't know if this qualifies as a sighting either. This event happened to my wife and oldest son about the same time (within a few years or so) as the first event I described. My wife and son swear they saw a black chimpanzee running through the field behind our house in the middle of the day. They watched from the kitchen window for a minute or two as it ran. They were about 20 feet above the field and a distance of about a hundred yards away. I've teased them about the incident over the years but they are both very sure of what they saw. My home is about four or five miles SW of the first incident I described.The black monkey was running west to east and disappeared into a ditch which sometimes carries water out of the nearby Middle Canyon. There are many homes in this area now which did not exist at the time, although some of them were there.\u0094 The witness' father talked about the ditch the \u0093monkey\u0094 ran to and said he didn\u0092t know if it would\u0092ve had water in it at the time of the incident or not. He said, as he had in the report he submitted, that it sometimes does and sometimes doesn\u0092t have water. He also said the animal possibly had to have passed quite close to the yards of one or two homes to get to the location. He reminded me that there are a lot of new homes in the area now.When I talked to the witness' father he asked if I\u0092d like to talk to his wife about it, but then said he didn\u0092t think she\u0092d want to talk to me. He said she still insists it was a chimpanzee. He pointed out that there were no reports of a missing chimpanzee in the area. I agreed that I thought it was very unlikely for a chimpanzee to be in the area, and that even if there was it would be unlikely for them to not to have heard about it.I don't think the witness and his mother saw a bear cub. The witness' father told me there are no bears in the Oquirrh Mountains, and this is verified by a look at the maps found on the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources' Utah Conservation Data Center website.The witness' father said his son would probably be willing to talk to me. The witness agreed and came to the phone. The witness is fifteen now, and I asked him how old he was at the time of the incident and he said he was probably about eleven or twelve years old. I asked the witness to tell me the story, and he did. It was a pretty simple story \u0096 basically just looking out the window at what he thought was a chimp running behind the house. I asked how far away it was and he said about a hundred yards (like his dad said in the report). A little later when I asked what he thought it was he said he thought it was a monkey. As I talked to the witness he sometimes referred to the animal as a chimp and sometimes as a monkey. I asked the witness what color the animal was and he said black. I asked how tall he thought it was and he guessed it was about four feet tall. I asked about the length of the fur and he said it had short fur. I asked if the animal was moving upright on two legs or down on all four, and the witness told me it alternated between being up on two and then putting its hands down and going on four legs. I asked how fast the animal was moving and the witness described its pace as a jog. I asked which direction the animal was going and he said it was going east toward the mountains. I asked the witness about the time of day and he said it took place at about three o\u0092clock in the afternoon. He said it was a warm sunny day. I asked the witness if he would be willing to submit a report on our website about this incident and he said he would. I told him his dad could help him if he needed, since his dad had already posted a report. The witness followed-through and submitted this report. After talking to the witness and his father, and reading this report, I'm convinced that the witness and his mother did see a primate near their home - as described in this report. I think the most probable explanation for what they saw is that it was a juvenile sasquatch. ",

            "Observed": "I experienced this incident while living on a military base in North Carolina.  I was approximately 14 or 15 years old at the time, I am fifty now, however the incident is still fresh in my mind.  At that time there was nothing for a young boy to do so my favorite pastime was wandering the military reservation and search for discarded C rations as we never had enough to eat in the house.There was 8 people in my family.  One day I had skipped school to go C ration hunting.  I never will forget that day, it was very warm and sunny, which for North Carolina is not unusual for a fall day.  We used to call it indian summer.  I had been wandering the deeper recesses of the reservation and was quite proud of the fact that not only had I stumbled across old farmsteads that the Marine corps had condemed in order to take the land but had a pretty good supply of discarded C rations.  Realizing it was getting late and I had better get home, I hit a tank trail made by the marines for thier vehicles to use.  I was getting closer to home so I decided to leave the trail and short cut it through the woods.  I knew this particular area and always avoided it because it was known as a pocosin, which in local terms meant an area that is real dense and swampy.  As I made my way in to the pocosin something really seemed out of the ordinary, all day I was used to hearing the sounds of the forest, birds, frogs squirrels chattering and what was great not seeing another human being. Now it was so quiet it didn't seem natural.  Something made me stop and to this very day I am perplexed about this I don't know why because at that age you have no fear as you think you are going to live forever.  I had no fear this time either however I felt that I was being watched.  I have never had this feeling again.  I slowly started to turn my head to the right when I caught a glimpse of brown.  My first thought was oh its only a deer.  I stood stock still and kept looking at the brown patch and it didnt move.  It was in a VERY dense part of the pocosin and my second thought was maybe its not a deer but possibly a discarded marine corps field jacket.  Now that would be a treasure, as I started to go towards the object I seem to hear the crashing of brush first then that brown patch moved, only it moved higher.  I  estimate a height of between 8 and 10 feet.  As it grew in height it also grew broader exposing more of itself.  I never saw its head or any real features other than the long fur because that thing was moving so fast through that pocosin that I was amazed how any animal that size could do that.  The crashing of the branches and underbrush was loud and I all I could do was stand there.  I don't know how long I remained in that position, all I rememeber is the sounds of the forest returned and thats what snapped me back to the present.  I have only recalled this story once and was told never again to repeat it to anyone or go back in those woods.  I have never returned to that area.",

The witness described the animal's movement as explosive; from a stationary position, to moving amazingly fast through thick woods and undergrowth.  Once it had risen up (assumed from a squatting position to standing) and ran into the woods, trees and brush were being crashed through as if it were a bulldozer.  The witness stated that they have spooked many deer and on one occasion a bear, and nothing could compare to the size and speed of what was observed.  The witness compared the sound of the footsteps as two telephone poles running, due to the weight.  Also observed, was a brief full body view through a clearing in the trees.  The witness stated that the animal had approximately 4 inch long, matted, reddish-brown hair that was undulating while the animal was running.  After losing sight of the animal, treetops were seen moving along with the sounds of it crashing through the woods. This lasted for approximately 10 to 15 seconds until nothing more was heard. ",
