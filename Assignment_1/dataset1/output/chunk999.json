            "Observed": "When I was 16, I was at my parents' cabin near the Olympic National Park (Lake Kokanee).  My friend Sean and I went down to the rope swing which was about 200 yards down hill from the house.  We had decided to call it a day and were putting our shoes and shirts on for the short hike back up the hill.  As we got ready to go, we could hear something approaching from the north of us.  This all happened in a short period of time but it seemed like an eternity.  Immediately we could tell it was on two feet; assuming that it was a person, I thought they were jumping from foot to foot.  The strides were very far apart.  I called out twice (who's there?  who's there?).  There was no reply.  As it got closer I could hear branches breaking underfoot.  Looking back, this thing was very large.  The brush there is very dense, on the side of the hill, so we could not see what was coming.  When it was no more than 40 yards away I could see it.  It swept back a vine maple, and looked at us like it was surprised.  It's very hard to explain but it looked like a person in a way.  It was not as tall as I had heard that they were, maybe 7'0\" at the most.  It had very wide shoulders, and was very muscular.  I did not smell a foul odor.  Its face did look somewhat human - I think it's the way it looked at us.  Anyway, almost as soon as we had seen it, we both turned and ran up the hill, grabbing branches to pull our way up.  I never looked back but I thought I could hear it chasing us for a short distance.",

The approaching steps of the animal were unusually solid sounding. It parted the last remaining bushes (vine maple thicket) with one black hand, revealing its entire head and torso. The witness described its skin as nearly black, with relatively thin, dark brown hair. The face had the overall appearance of that of a gorilla, but with a very broad nose with downward directed nostrils. The shoulders were instantly obvious as being unusually broad and muscular, but beyond these details, imprinted on the observer's mind virtually in a second, no additional observations were made.",
