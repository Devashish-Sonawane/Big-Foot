The scream/howl was so close to him that he jumped up and ran while the howl was still going on, and he didn't stop until he was out of the area and back to the road, about a half-mile away.  When he initially started running, the scream/howl ceased.  It was described as rising in pitch, extremely loud, and similar to the howls found on the BFRO website.The area is described as being extensive forest interspersed with many swamps.  The Muscatatuck River runs through this area.  He hasn't been back to those woods since.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and his partner had been harvesting freshwater mussels by \"toe digging\" (feeling for the mussels with their feet) in a restricted area. As they were setting in the car warming up and smoking they saw what they first though was a \"big man\" walking down the road toward them. They watched for several seconds. The witness related \"I thought it was the game warden and we were busted [for collecting mussels in a restricted area]. I thought 'let's just get this over with' and turned on the lights. What the light revealed  was large and hairy. \"If you've ever seen 'Harry and the Hendersons' it was damn close\". The hair was reddish brown and appeared matted on the sides. When they returned to recover their mussels the next day they estimated the creature's height from nearby trees. \"It was every bit of eight feet\". The log they assumed had been thrown was too heavy for them to move.The witness described the vocalization as a \"yawning holler\". There were two or three vocalizations before the car was struck by the log.Additional Comments by Matt Moneymaker:Assuming this was an actual encounter with a sasquatch, it would be an example of intimidation behavior, rather than a precursor to  an attack. The fact that it occurred in a restricted area is important.  Unprovoked encounters that happen in areas frequented by humans usually do not involve overt intimidation.  This type of behavior seems to occur most often in areas where humans rarely venture.",
