Her first impression upon seeing this creature was that it was someone in a suit playing a joke, but when it jumped the fence without breaking stride, it convinced her it was something real.  She described the jump as 'animalistic', like a deer would jump a fence - very fluid and quick.The creature came from the left side of the road (an open field), and crossed to the right (a field leading into a forested area).  It was approximately 15 feet away from their car when it crossed in front of them.  She described the hair color as brown/black, 'very dark'.  She wasn't able to see it's face, for it never turned to look towards them.She stated this is something she'll never forget.",
