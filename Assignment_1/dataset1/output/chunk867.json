            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness (an 11 year old child) and her father at length about the incident. Typically, the BFRO refrains from publishing reports that are submitted by children under a certain age, but this particular witness' testimony was quite detailed, and was corroborated by her father.The witness and her family live on the outskirts of the Chattahoochee National Forest, very close to the Cohutta Wilderness.  I found the witness to be very articulate and direct about what she saw. Her father expressed to me that he was very proud of his daughter; that she made excellent grades in school, and isn't one to fabricate stories. The animal that she saw seemed to be interested in the outdoor kennel, which housed the family's dogs and their newborn pups. The puppies had been crying rather loudly that morning, and I suspect that the sasquatch came to investigate the sounds. The young witness described observing a very large sasquatch that was immediately alarmed by her, and retreated quickly. When I asked her about the \"pointy ears\" that she noticed, she elaborated that the tops of the ears looked exposed and not obscured by the longer hair on its head. This gave her the initial impression that it had pointy ears.  I speculate that the sasquatch may have interpreted the sounds of the young pups as a potential food source. That region of the Southern Appalachians experienced a particularly harsh winter during that time, and the sasquatch may have been desperate for food; desperate enough to approach a human habitation as the sun was rising.  Oftentimes, during cold winters, the reports that we receive in North Georgia occur very close to rural homes that lie on the periphery of large tracts of forest. This ecotone often provides the most food resources for resident sasquatches. Large deer herds are often located in many of the fields and rural agricultural plots just outside of the Chattahoochee National Forest. Moreover, the data suggests that sasquatches occasionally exploit human food resources as well (raiding trash cans, stealing food from outdoor storage containers and freezers, etc.).      The following month after this incident occurred, I explored the general area with GA-BFRO investigators Morris Collins and Keith McLain. We camped at the site of another Class A incident (Report #25043). We also experienced one of the more severe snow and ice storms in the area in recent years.The Cohutta Mountains are rugged, beautiful, and provide a viable habitat for sasquatches. ",
