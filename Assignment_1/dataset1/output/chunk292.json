            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness on the phone, and later met with her and her husband at the location of the sighting. Map of the location:While driving west on US-192, the husband had run over an alligator on his way to work and damaged his car. He had managed to drive it about a mile beyond the accident before he was forced to pull over and call for a tow.  He called his wife to pick him up. On her way to pick him up, she stopped to take a picture of the dead alligator. The officer said it was an eleven ft. alligator. This is one of the pics she took of what was left:She noticed vultures circling, already on the road kill as she pulled up. She never got out of her car, but began taking pictures.  As she took pictures, she looked around to make sure no other cars were coming as she stopped. At that time, she noticed a man about 100 + yards away (she is from NY and originally reported the distance as \u0093a block\u0094) walking rapidly from the road kill into the woods. She thought at first it was a ranch hand from the nearby cattle ranch, but realized that the figure was uniform in color, didn\u0092t appear to have clothing on, was standing quite high as the grass was 3 - 4 feet high and he was towering over the top of it. She saw the creature walk into the woods with 3 to 4 large arm-swinging strides.  She saw it only in profile, and it never looked her way.  The witness saw the figure from this location, heading toward the woods:This happened at sunrise and its possible the bigfoot had been attracted to the road kill and her arrival scared it off.  Vultures can smell a dead animal from 20 miles, it could be assumed that a bigfoot would know that the vultures indicate a road kill.  I visited the location in June when the grass is not as high as it would be in August. It is evident the figure had to have been more than 9 feet tall for her to see it so well. An average sized man would have been difficult to notice in the tall grass. Looking for bigfoot evidence in the area was difficult as Hurricane Debby rained out the area for four days prior. I will return at a later date, and update this report if anything is found.A creek is situated in the woods, surrounded by a cattle pasture:The area where this happened is very desolate and swampy, on the edge of the Holopaw Forest  and the Bull Creek Wildlife Management Area. This section of US-192 does not have a lot of traffic. ",
