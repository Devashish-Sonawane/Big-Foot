The distance to the animal was approximately fifty feet. During this time he noted the following. The animal was closer to seven feet tall.  The body was \"thick looking\", with broad shoulders.  He estimates the weight to be around four hundred pounds.  The head of the animal seemed to be directly connected to the body.  No neck was noted.  The arms reached to below the knees.  Further information was not available due to the animal being seen in silhouette. He emphasized that the arm swing was in an exaggerated motion while walking.The grunt sound was short and abrupt.  It was also low pitched.  The area had been stripped mined, and the forest has reclaimed the area.  Several farms are located in the area as are streams.  Deer are plentiful.
