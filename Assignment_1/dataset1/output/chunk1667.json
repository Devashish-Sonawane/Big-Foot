It was crouched down, and she could see that it had brown hair.Additional comments from main observer:- Oval, kind of squared face with sloped forehead.- Wisps of hair coming up into a peak on top of its head.- No, or barely visible, neck.- Orangish brown eyes, light reflected off them some when it looked in her direction.- Eyes sunk deep into face with thick brow.- Shoulder width estimated at 4.5 feet.- Heavy, bulky thick muscular build.- Long legged.- Hands were at least three times the size of a large man's hands.- Stubby fingers and blackish brown fingernails.- The longest thickest hair was on top of its head.- Hair estimated to be four inches long where it came to a peak.- Hair stopped just above the forehead and no hair on face.- Body hair was about two and a half inches long.- No ears were seen. - Skin coloration was almost black with a slight grayish/ browntint to it.- Unable to see the sex of it.- Nonaggressive and perhaps curious.- It moved with a fast, quick pace, slightly hunched over with its arms well below its thigh area, almost to its knees.- \"When it turned to look at me, it moved its entire upper body as if it just couldn't turn its head. You might say it turned around completely to look at me.\"",
