The witness stated that when he first noticed the animal, its arms were at its sides as it quietly stared at him.  The animal was very still. He noticed a \"dusty-grayish\" tone to the skin at the chest area.  He stated that the animal's very matted hair was about 5-6 inches long.  The unkempt hair gave the animal a \"scruffy\" look.  The face was \"human-like, but scary and unusual.\"  The matted hair on the head was continuous with the beard, and there was thin hair on the face.  He noticed the hair hanging from the calves, but stated that the hair was thinner at the knees and near the upper thighs.  The nose was \"human-looking.\"  The scream was very loud, piercing, and high-pitched.     ",
