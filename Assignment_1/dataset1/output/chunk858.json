            "Observed": "Hello .The year was 2006, July.  The time was eight thirty PM. We were driving back from Mt. St. Helens, Washington. It was a sunny day so we went to see the mountain that day. We were driving down the road along side the Toutle River which was to the right of the van. We were in my family van at the time. We been driving some time on the road. I had my RCA video camera fully charged ready to go. I was in the back seat of the Ford Areostar van and my daughter in the seat in front of me. She was about 8 years old then. When out of the corner of my eye I spotted a large brownish red gray ... what I thought was a bear at first, standing in the Toutle River up to its middle calf.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I called the witness. He was eager to tell the account of what transpired. It was summer, and about 8:30 PM, and he and his family members had just left the Mt. St. Helens observatory. It would have still been light until about 9:30PM at that time of year. He said that the Toutle River was on the right side of the vehicle as they were driving west-bound. Also, the creature was only 30 feet from the road, and standing in the river about 5 feet from the bank. This puts it very close to them, and a good position to be able to see details. This information helped me to find the most likely location using Google Earth.Details of the creature. He said it looked like it was 9 feet tall. It had a large head about the size of a 5-gallon bucket. The head was pointy on top. He could see the musculature in its legs, back, and arms even under the hair. The hair was reddish brown with hints of gray. The hair appeared to be about four inches long and shiny. The stature was massive. Very wide shoulders, with a narrow waste, big barrel chest, and long arms. It was facing away, looking down at something in the river.The creature was observed not only by him, but also by his daughter, who was eight years old at the time. It is my opinion that this witness and his daughter both saw a sasquatch.",
