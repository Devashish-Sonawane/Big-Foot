            "Observed": "I was in the Shenandoah National Park, on Skyline Drive. I had stopped at one of two overlooks (they are only about 2.5 miles apart) in order to take photos of the sunset. The Park Service closes Skyline Dr. during the Virginia hunting season at 5:00 PM, so most of the visitors had already left. At a few minutes to five, as I was preparing to put my camera away, I was just standing, watching the changing sky. Downhill, and across an open area in front of the overlook, I heard two quick knocks come from the woods. About 30 seconds later, and several hundred yards to the right of the knocks, I heard one more come from the woods. About a minute later, two more knocks came from behind me, uphill and to my left.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After conversing with Mr. P. the following information can be added to his report:-He is a nature photographer with many hours of experience in the Shenandoah National Park over the last 20 years.-He was alone at a roadside over look just north of the route 33 entrance to Skyline Drive. He asked that we not publish the names of these two overlooks.-The sun had set and the weather was partly cloudy with no wind, indicating the knocks were not wind driven.-The first two quick knocks originated directly downhill from Mr. P's position at the overlook, somewhere in the wood line, about 100 yards distant.-Mr. P. was surprised by how close the knocks sounded, and they had the distinct ring of wood on wood.-The second knock, a single, was farther to the right, but still below the level of the overlook.-The third set knocks, another double, were louder than the first three, but up hill from the overlook, on the opposite side of Skyline Drive, and estimated again at 100 yards distant.-Given his many years of experience in the woods Mr. P is very familiar with the typical knocking sounds of the forest, wood peckers, wind in trees, etc. In light of all that experience, Mr. P admits he has never heard knocks that sounded like these, except when he was chopping wood.-Mr. P. was not aware of anyone else who had described any potential sasquatch behavior in the park.Incidents within Shenandoah National Park likely occur from time to time, but to date reporting of such incidents from that region are relatively sparse. The region is very suitable habitat for sasquatch and the overlook Mr. P visited offers good opportunity for sasquatch to observe humans discreetly, as they stop to admire the view. Witnesses with similar experiences in or around the park are encouraged to submit their report to BFRO at their earliest opportunity. ",
