            "Observed.1  ": "Drive east of Main Street two weeks ago. Two Corona residents, 18 and 20 years of age, told police last Tuesday they had seen the monster and it had chased them while they fled in their car. They said they first saw the animal a couple of weeks prior to that time. After the initial report was filed at the police station, a number of persons told officers they had sighted the beast. They said they saw the animal before The Daily Independent carried the story. Yesterday and last night, police received additional reports from persons who sighted the monster. A Corona resident, Irene P. Rambo, 18, of 217 S. Garfield, told officers she saw the beast about 3 p.m. yesterday. It looked over a high patio fence in front of her apartment, she stated. She described the animal as about 10 feet tall, half human, half ape, and covered with hair. It had human-like teeth she said. She told officers that she grabbed her two-year-old son from the patio and locked herself and the boy inside the apartment. One report said the monster had been sighted at Chase and Skyline Drive about 3:30 p.m. yesterday. A number of persons have called the police station asking if there is really a monster in South Corona. Police said, \"We can only reply that no officer has seen it.\" Police continued to check out South Corona area yesterday afternoon and last night. A number of area residents joined the hunt. One officer said there were more persons in one grove than trees.  Other officers reported about 50 persons were in the groves at one time searching for the animal. The monster was supposedly seen originally on Corona Foothill Lemon Co. property, so Ned Willits, chairman of Foothill's board of directors was asked the following question: \"Is it true that you are harboring a monster on your land?\" \"Well,\" he replied, \"it is sort of like the time when they closed up a small zoo on the Earl Ranch. All of a sudden we had hyenas and other creatures all over. Those were real, however, not Monday morning creations.\" \"No,\" he continued, \"I haven't seen anything. At least I haven't gotten close enough to be able to see facial hair in the middle of the night.\"",

            "Media Issue": "The article quoted Heicher as saying the three tracks were 18 inches long and nine inches wide, with five toes. \"I don\u00b9t think it was human, and I ruled out wildlife tracks. I don\u00b9t know what it was,\" Heicher told the Glenwood Springs Post Independent. Heicher said that if the tracks were a hoax, they were put in a place that only about three people a year would stumble across. Most of the Denver Post article focused on reported sightings, including one north of Crested Butte, plus tracks and forensic investigations from a Texas law enforcement finger print expert. Many of the sightings put Bigfoot at 8-feet-tall, and 450 pounds. Heicher compared the meat intake of a 150 pound mountain lion to a 450 pound Bigfoot, and estimated it could survive on one deer every two or three days. \"The food supply is out there,\" Heicher said. If anyone wanted to mount an expedition to find a Bigfoot, Heicher said it could be along the lines of how the DOW tries to find grizzly bears. For bears, the DOW baits traps and sets up cameras with infra red film, that don\u00b9t require a flash, plus motion sensors to set them off. Even if a grizzly bear isn\u00b9t captured, the species can be proven by DNA tests on fur left behind. ",

For one thing, nobody has found any physical evidence, such as scat. This comes at the same time an increased number of people are exploring the back country. Heicher said that it seems like bear or mountain lion hunters would have found some evidence, because they hunt with dogs in remote areas where nobody goes. \"You\u00b9d run across some signs, but it doesn\u00b9t happen.\" Folks who believe in Bigfoot sometimes point to plane crashes that go undiscovered for years, and say that Sasquatch could stay that hidden as well. \"But airplanes don\u00b9t move around.
