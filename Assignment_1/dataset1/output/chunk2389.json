            "Also Noticed": "I was camped about a mile from the shelter and was enjoying myself when I suddenly felt uneasy and decided to go to [name omitted] shelter where a man on the trail said other people were camping. As I went about 50 yards from where I was camping I suprised something that I did not see but it took off down the side on a cliff and I assumed it was a bear. When I got to the shelter just after dark I set up in the shelter! About 5:30am I heard a very loud high pitched howling sound twice that was like nothing I have ever heard of or seen on TV. The first howl sounded like it was answered by the second that was not quite as loud. I sat straight up and thought \"what was that\" I did not go back to sleep. It did not sound even close to any animal I have ever heard.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness multiple times via telephone. The witness is very familiar with the area, and is a seasoned outdoorsman. He is also involved with Search and Rescue, and assisted in the recent case of the female hiker who went missing in northeast Georgia on New Year\u0092s Day.  The witness had selected a campsite, built a fire, and settled in for the night. After approximately an hour and fifteen minutes had passed, he was suddenly overwhelmed by an extreme sense of danger and fear. He described the sensation as unique, and unprecedented in his outdoor experience. There was seemingly nothing in the immediate environment to alarm him; no intimidating sights, sounds, or smells. This sensation compelled him to pack his things, put out his fire, and head to the nearest shelter. As he was exiting his camp, he heard a very large animal move quickly away from him through thick brush. The animal made noticeable pounding sounds as its feet struck the ground, and the brush snapped and cracked considerably as it moved through. The witness confided in me that it sounded enormous, and initially thought it to be a very large bear. He noticed no other sounds while walking to the shelter. Around 5:30 AM, he began hearing characteristic sounds from a nearby ravine (in the vicinity of his initial camp) that sounded like the vocalizations attributed to sasquatches. He described the sounds as the loudest vocalizations he had ever heard in the wilderness.  His impression was that he was hearing a large, adult animal calling to and receiving responses from a younger, smaller animal. This incident occurred in an area of ongoing study by local BFRO investigators. The surrounding area has a history of sightings dating back to the mid-1800s. The nature of the unseen animal\u0092s approach is similar to other reports involving sasquatches. The witness\u0092 outdoor experience and familiarity with calls of known animals helps us to eliminate other animals as the source of the anomalous sounds. ",
