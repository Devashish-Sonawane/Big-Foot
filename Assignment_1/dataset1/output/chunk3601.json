The tree knocks heard on the shows of BFRO, SOUND ABSOLUTELY nothing like what I heard. The knocks did not sound like an axe striking a wood or tree (sounding like a (chis-whop) the sounds I heard were definitly four to five foot lengths and dry enough to leave the impression of the loud sounds heard that SEEMED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 100-150 yards off to my right.  I HAVE TO SAY, AT THAT TIME, I NEVER HEARD ANY THING ABOUT A \"BIG FOOT\" UNTIL 1973, BUT STILL REMEMBERED THE STRANGE knocks heard back then.  Wish I HAD KNOWN, Maybe I would have watched for other signs,  now I am 89yrs old and still want to go back looking, believe I could with the help of pack strings.",

He feels the people on the \u0093Finding Bigfoot\u0094 show are doing tree knocking \u0093all wrong.\u0094  Sasquatch don\u0092t use \u0093willow switches or bats\u0094 for tree knocking, they use \u0093six inch logs\u0094 to \u0093smack big stumps of trees.\u0094  He remembers the forest ranger telling of the time he rode up a valley and saw a real tall old man jump off the bank in front of him.  He wasn\u0092t wearing any clothes. He had an animal skin on him.  People in town at the hardware store also told stories of \u0093the old man of the Pasayten.\u0094  Witness stated if he knew of sasquatch back then, he wouldn\u0092t have been too comfortable hiking a mile to get water every few days while he worked at the lookout.  He also would have been running down the trail back to the airstrip instead of walking.    The \"pack strings\" he is referring to is a line of pack horses or pack mules working in a line, tied together, carrying materials and/or equipment in the wilderness, often climbing mountain sides.

The entire woods is on a 45 degree angle leading down to the swamp except the small bowl like section I was hunting in.  The spot is very thick with pawpaw trees which provide ample cover for wildlife till about mid November.  I was sitting in my tree stand about twenty feet off the ground.  It was after 5pm which is what I refer to as magic time because that is when the deer start to move in the evening.  As the last rays of light had begun to fall onto the forest floor two does shot out from the brush behind me.  They seemed nervious and kept looking back behind my tree.  I thought maybe a buck was following them so I nocked an arrow and prepared to see a large buck walk out of the brush from behind me.  Then it hit me, the ungodly stench.  It kind of smelled like garbage or like someone had lifted the lid on a septic tank.  It was awful.  Then a log flew out from the brush behind me and struck the tree I was in at the base.  I nearly soiled my britches.  I turned to look behind me and what ever it was it ran off busting through the underbrush and I never got a clear look at what it was.  It let out a bloodcurdling scream as it ran off.  I froze not believing what had just happened.  I waited for at least an hour before I got down to walk back to my truck.",
