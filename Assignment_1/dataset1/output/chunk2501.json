The small mountains are very densely wooded with hardwoods. There is one two-lane highway which traverses this mountain. The family's mountain has a fairly large pond and about six houses, none of which can be seen from the others because of the trees. I do not recall any specific features of the area.",

It is not very densely populated, and most inhabitants of the mountain are members of the family. We were walking into the woods but were still within eyesight of two houses and a field. The boy and I noticed it about the same time. We saw a tall (about 7 feet tall), bulky, lumbering figure coming toward us, from about 30-40 feet away. It was lumbering upright but was hunched over. It had a very large head. It was coming toward us. We turned around and ran toward the clearing, yelling for the girl to follow us. It chased us and got to within probably 15 feet of us. It stopped before the edge of the woods. We didn't see where it went, because we ran until we were out of breath, well away from the edge of the woods",

I know that I could hear my heart pounding in my ears and we were crunching leaves and running through brush. We were too terrified to yell, I think. I remember thinking it was strange that the creature didn't seem to be making any noise as he ran after us. He definitely seemed as though he was trying to chase us away, though I do not know if he had an intent to catch us.",
