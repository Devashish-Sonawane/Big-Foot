They are where no humans have been in months and where they came into and out of the road is not where a person would travel. The stride is approximately 3 ft and the offset from left to right is about 1 ft. I have picts and video of what I seen.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I called the witness and he told me about what happened. He has access via permit to be on Weyerhaeuser land. He drove up to near the trailhead to Vanson Lake. He said that there was about 5 feet of packed snow on the road, but that his jeep is pretty good in those conditions. He was there on April 24th, and then went back April 25th also. He was the first one up in the area this spring, as he had to cut out about 30 trees off the road. He was traveling southwest, down-hill, when he found the track-line. It went on for about 800 yards. He got out and took a few photos. He drove along, taking video out his jeep window. It is very difficult to get clear video under these lighting conditions. He also took a couple of photos. The length of the tracks is estimated to be 12-13 inches. The tracks were somewhat melted out. There was just the general shape of what one would expect to see if it were a bigfoot track. Due to being melted out, there is no detail present. This leaves only the step length and stride to make an evaluation. The step length was about 36-40 inches, making the stride six to seven feet. This is exceptional for being in five feet of snow. A human using snow-shoes would make an entirely different track line, and if they were wearing boots, could not match that step length in deep snow. With the time of year, conditions of deep snow and step length, it is quite likely that these tracks were from a sasquatch, although not a particularly large sasquatch.This is the best photo of one of the tracks.As with many bigfoot witnesses, when the investigator starts asking questions, additional interesting facts come out, as well as other bigfoot sightings that were never reported, and usually never talked about out of fear. This is one of those.He grew up in the woods near Mt. St Helens. Thirty years ago, when he was ten years old, he was with his family, driving down a logging road in their Suburban. His parents used to take them out and teach them how to drive on the logging roads. Knowing the area, and the people who have lived lifetimes in the back country, a ten-year-old driving is not surprising. They drive tractors, quads, and dirt bikes. He said that while he was driving, he saw a large hairy animal on two legs cross from the left side to the right side of the road and vanish into the trees. It was on a high bank, took two steps and it was off the right side of the road.This witness has life-long outdoors experience, hunting, fishing and camping. That he was confident enough to take his jeep up into that area with the snow that deep speaks to his experience and skill in the outdoors. ",
