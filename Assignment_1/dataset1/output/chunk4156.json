            "Observed.1  ": " CBO members were perturbed with Biscardi for two reasons. One, he said that he and Ivan Marx, who has been hunting the bigfoot creature for more than 20 years, did not believe that CBO reports were valid, and two, Biscardi's members in a safari purportedly once shot one of the creatures.   Smith said that the man who saw the creature in Palmdale saw it running around his house.  Evidently, the creature likes to run around houses and leaving footprints.  That is its MO in the East Lancaster area where footprints were found around several houses recently.  One woman reported that the creature ran around her house and scratched at the door.  A small boy sent to tell his father supper was ready was found hours later crying near the corral.  When asked what happened to him, he answered that a big, furry man would not let him pass.   \t  Droppings from an animal believed to be bigfoot were found by CBO members near 270th St. East and Ave. J.  It was near 100th St. East and Ave J that the two most credible sightings were reported, the first two, in fact. Those sightings were by two marines whose auto skid marks were found the next morning and then a week later a nineteen year old girl who came home from babysitting in the early morning hours. \tWhen Smith and Adams spotted the creature recently at Nine mile Canyon, Adams saw the bottom part of it as it ran from them through the bush and it emerged momentarily at the spot where Smith was breaking camp.  He saw just the upper part of the body.  The creature was running up a steep incline when first spotted by the two men.  They described it as being seven to eight feet tall.  They intend to go back there and to keep searching close to home.",
