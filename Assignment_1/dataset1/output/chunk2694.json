A little while later, we heard something that sounded like someone knocking on a tree with a piece of wood or something. These sounds continued alternating, off and on for about 20 minutes or so. I remember that my friend and I were talking about how the sounds were a little strange, and getting louder. At one point, I realized that the sounds were coming from a point very close to us, and they seemed to be coming from the same place, so we stood up to see if we could see anything.",

The Sample Road end Starts at a point not far from the intersection of Sample Rd. and Hemlock Drive. The Bryant Rd. end starts about 1/3 of the way down Bryant Rd. coming from Duncan Avenue. The sighting occurred about halfway up the pipeline. This location is, I believe, completely within the boundaries of Hampton Township.",

The animal was heard many times as well, without being seen. Footprints were seen, my parents made plaster casts of footprints, and researchers were called and they interviewed my parents. The interviewers seemed to be trying to connect the bigfoot sightings with UFO sightings in the area. This was all in the 70's and 80's. I do not know the specifics of any recent sightings in the area besides the one on Wildwood Sample Road, however, I have heard that sightings in the area are still not rare. which is about 1 1/2-2 miles from my sighting, I think.",

The witness is now in his fifties and recalled the encounter in detail even though it took place over twenty years ago.The witness described the animal as slender but not skinny, lean and muscular with long arms. In the witness's words the animal was built sort of like a fullback on a football team. There were no smells associated with the animal.The witness described the call of the animal as similar to the call of some members of the Anatidae Family, which includes Swans, Geese and Ducks. Other residence in the area heard this call quite often mainly in the evening. I emailed the witness an assortment of Sasquatch vocalization recordings from the BFRO web site. The witness emailed me back and said the call sounded like the whoop howl in the Sierra Sounds, Bigfoot Recordings CDs, available at www.bigfootsounds.com. Click here for the Whoops and Knocks RecordingThe witness cannot recall what organization the investigators belonged to, or who they were. However they could not have been from the BFRO as the BFRO was established 24 years later. Most people that lived in the area at the time including the witness felt that the UFO sightings had no ties to Bigfoot, the strange calls they heard and tracks they found. I asked the witness if he would have access to the plaster casts his parents took, as luck would have it he did have a couple of pictures, which he scanned and emailed to me. I have attached the photos below. ",
