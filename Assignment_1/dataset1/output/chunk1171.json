It was late, the kids were sleeping in the back seats, I was driving with wife in passenger seat. Living on Amelia Island (Fernandina Beach) with relatives in Jacksonville, we frequently made this 45 min to an hour drive 2 or 3 times a week. Although a scenic trip during the day, at night its just a boring two lane road cutting through intracoastal type pine tree, dune-filled land. With no traffic heading south, I had my bright lights on and was just listening to the radio and staring straight ahead. My wife was sitting quietly, and, I actually thought she had fallen alsleep as it was approaching midnight. I had just rounded a curve and began on a straight-away north to northwest toward the entrance to Little Talbot Island State Park, which is on the right side of the road, when, in the distance about 150-200 yds ahead on me, I caught glimpse of a bipedal figure standing on the West side of the road just off the right-of-way, not moving.",
