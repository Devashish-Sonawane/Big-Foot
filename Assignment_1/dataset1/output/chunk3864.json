            "Observed": "I grew up in a very rural area of Tennessee.  My grandparents had a farm that lies on the border of Monroe and McMinn counties.  I was playing in the garage which is downhill from the house.  Across the road was a wooded area.  As I was playing I felt like someone was staring at me.  I looked up to find what I first thought was a very hairy man looking at me until I realized it didn't have on any clothes.  I became very frightened and dropped to the ground between cars and rolled up in underneath the car.",
