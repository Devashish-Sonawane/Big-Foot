            "Observed": "I have to apologize about not posting my sighting sooner simply because most folks just laugh and look at you as a fruit cake or something. However, this makes my second sighting of a Big Foot. My son and I was bow hunting in Reynolds county Mo, and I decided to hunt a pond where deer was using it consistently. To make a long story short, I got settled in a tree behind the pond where I could watch a hollower leading up to the pond and a log road running past the pond as well. So around 5 pm I noticed how quiet the woods became. The squirrels I had been watching disappeared, the birds became silent, so I started to become concerned of human activity. So I began to search the woods to see if someone was in the area when this large black figure appeared walking down the other side of this hollower I had set up to watch. At first I thought this was a man. But as it kept walking I noticed how massive it was, and all of a sudden it stopped and took two steps backwards and turned and looked straight at me. It was then I realized that this is not a man but a Big Foot. As this creature looked at me, I could clearly see its eyes and nose. I could see flesh around its eyes and cheeks and also see hair covering its face as well. It stood there looking at me for I guess a good fifteen or twenty seconds, then turned and walked on down the ridge and disappeared into the woods. Needless to say, I was scared out of my mind and refused to climb down the tree, but it was getting dark and I knew I had to meet my son back out on the main road. Finally I got up the nerve and came down. So I walked over to where I saw it and looked back to the tree I was in, and then it became clear that what I had seen could not have been a man, because he would not have been tall enough to have been seen over the underbrush. This creature was at least seven and a half or eight foot tall. When I met up with my son I asked him if he met or passed anybody or vehicles on his way to pick me up, and he said no then I told him what I saw.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Tommy at length. I was the investigator on his original Report #46826 a few years back. The encounter was as he described, and I did get some further information from him. It is as follows: He was in his portable tree stand, about 30 ft. up a rather large sturdy tree. The tree overlooked a trail (hollow) that meandered through another large stand of trees, and the trail (hollow) dumps out into a clearing. As mentioned, he was focused on 2 squirrels playing when he heard a \"rustling, shuffling\" coming down the trail. Distance from the tree he was in, to the spot of seeing the creature was about 75 yards. The creature was blending in to the shadows from the trees, and that is where he came up with the coloring of a very dark brown or \"blackish\". He saw the massive creature walking down the trail, and as soon as it hit the clearing, it stopped dead in its tracks and looked straight up at him. It did not stop and look around in any other direction, or at any other animals or objects. Straight at him, as though he knew he was there the entire time. This totally unnerved him, and he froze. He is quite certain he was frozen already, and the creature was \"drilling a hole right through him\" with his stare. He described the creature as:\"A flat nose, but not totally flat. Flesh was a dark tan, like a white person with a very deep tan. Huge fat lips. Eyes were squinted and huge. There was hair on and around the face but it was sparse in that area. It was slightly bent over when it was looking up at me\". When it was finished with the stare down, it \" stood up straight as can be, seemed to take a deep breath, and squared up its shoulders, and walked on down the trail it was on in the first place\". The creature went on its way like the situation never happened. Didn't look back, make any sound, nothing.  Not concerned about the witness at all. As he mentioned, when he DID finally climb down out of the tree, he went over to where the creature was standing. He determined from the height of the underbrush and low hanging branches, that it was indeed NOT a human. It was what he thought in the first place, a Sasquatch. It was not, and could not have been a man. I have camped and investigated this area, and it is quite active. The witness is as honest and as down to earth as just about anyone I have met, inside AND outside the scope of this subject matter. ",

            "Observed": "On February 15th, 2014 at approximately 4 pm my wife, 2 children and I were driving into Geneva State Park. It had been frigid cold and we wanted to see how frozen over the lake and marina were.  At the corner of Padinarum and Lake Road I jokingly asked my daughter if she had \u0093passed gas\u0094\u0085..I was told NO!!  My wife made a comment that the really bad smell was coming from outside.  We often times drive through the State Park watching for wildlife.  We drove slowly through the marina parking lot and stopped for just a few moments.  We noticed there was one truck in the parking lot and two others pulled closer to the lake.  They appeared to all belong to the same snow removal service as they were out of their trucks talking to one another.   As we were pulling out maybe 10 minutes later we were approaching the first curve just outside of the parking lot and I noticed something walking about 50 to 60 yards from the road and it was moving in an easterly direction.  My first thought was it was a person.  I told my wife to stop and she too saw it.  She said it was furry but at the angle I was looking I was unable to make out anything except a very dark figure that \u0093seemed\u0094 tall and was definitely walking on two legs.  My wife later told me that she saw arms swaying. In an instant it was GONE!!!  I got out of the vehicle and walked about 40 yards in.  I was unable to spot any sign that would make me think it was anything but a person.  Although, being that the temperature was 15 degrees with a feel like temp in the low single digits I wondered why anyone would be out in this weather. There was also heavy snow on the ground.   I did see some snowmobile tracks but we always drive through the park with the windows down and nobody in the family had heard any engines at all!!  I returned to the vehicle and we drove a short distance to Crabapple Picnic Area parking lot.  We pulled all the way around the large lot and stopped just about 20 yds from the exit and stopped the van.  My wife shut the van off and we told the kids to be quiet.  My wife asked me to whoop or mimic a Bigfoot yell.  I whooped once\u0085\u0085nothing.  I waited about a whole minute and let out three large whoops.  Something whooped back!!!!!!!  In a 5 min span of time we heard 2 distinct whoops, 1 scream, and two wood knocks.(We did NOT do any wood knocks at all)   We did NOT see anything else though.  It was difficult to control the excitement in the vehicle.  I am certainly NOT saying that my wife and I had seen a Bigfoot, but we did see a bipedal \u0093something\u0094 and heard some very distinct noises, and finally smelled something really nasty.  I hope that if anyone else had any type of sighting in and around this area they would come forward and share it.  OR\u0085.if someone KNOWS they were walking in that area at about that time, that would be nice to know too.",
