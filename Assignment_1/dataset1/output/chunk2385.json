As I was driving down Green Lane towards Levitown a giant creature that I can only describe as a Sasquatch. The creature was standing on two feet and had almost a human like form except for its nearly 9 foot stature. As it crossed in front of my car I could see it more clearly in my headlights, it was a very dark brown, but it was more like hair than fur which I found to be even stranger. It couldn't have taken more than three steps to completely cross the road. As I swerved it was already nearly off the road all I could see though my drivers window were what seemed to be piercing blue eyes that seemed to glow. Though I could not differentiate if they were glowing or if it was a reflection of the moon. I haven't been able to sleep much since, all I can think about is those piercing eyes. Once I found this website and read of the sightings, I knew I had to share what I saw. I've been looking online for another explanation, but I can't find anything.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to this witness over the phone and he set forth some additional details.  The witness was coming back from a night construction job around 1 AM, headed towards his home.  He was traveling northwest on Green Lane, approximately 150 yards away from the Mill Creek Road intersection. Up ahead, he saw an upright figure crossing the road from east to west (left to right).  He stopped his vehicle about 15 feet from the creature as it walked across the road. The creature looked directly at the witness while only taking two strides to cross the road, into the swamp.  The witness described the creature as approximately 9 feet tall, dark brown hair (about 3-4 inches in length), long arms, and piercing blue eyes that shined in the headlights.  He described the face as dark colored, flat, with the distance between the eyes much greater than in humans, and dark thick lips. The witness was disturbed by this encounter and called his roommate immediately upon returning home.  He still has dreams and disturbed sleep about this encounter. He is an avid outdoors-man and simply cannot explain what he saw.  The exact location of this sighting is situated in a swampy power line cut out that starts at a county park adjacent to Interstate 276, less than a mile away.  This power line cut is also directly adjacent to Mill Creek and nearby Magnolia Lake. This location is certainly filled with food sources and the power line cut makes for a quick and efficient travel route.  The surrounding area is heavily populated with subdivisions and commercial space.  ",
