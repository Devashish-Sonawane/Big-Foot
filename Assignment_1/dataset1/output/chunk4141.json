            "Observed.1  ": "For the past several days persons near Louisiana, Mo., have reported seeing something hairy, smelly and more than seven feet tall.  Tuesday, Randy Emert, 18, of Peoria said he'd seen it, and Wednesday a jogger in Cairo, reported a sighting.  Some contend the creature comes from outer space.  Maybe, but it would still have to pay taxes says Thomas Hayes of Chicago IRS office.  \u0093Technically\u0085if it earned income while resident in the United States,\u0094 it would have to file a tax return, said Hayes.  Failure to file would mean a fine or imprisonment, he said. If Whatever-It-Is is between 18 and 35 years old, Uncle Sam wants it, as spokesman for the Chicago Selective Service office said.  Hairy and smelly it may be, but if it\u0092s a resident alien-alien from where doesn\u0092t matter-it must register for the draft, the spokesman said.  Alien from where is what troubles the Bureau of Naturalization and Immigration, says a spokesman for the director\u0092s office.  Every January 1, every alien must file both his old address and his present one-if he doesn\u0092t, he\u0092s subject to $100 fine and deportation, the spokesman said.  However, it\u0092s \u0093entitled to due process and the full protection of the Constitution,\u0094 the office said.  Deportation, if it came to that, might pose a problem with an interstellar alien. \u0093We\u0092d have to get together with NASA,\"  the spokesman mused.  \u0093Our budget is only $143 million and I\u0092m not sure we could afford the fare.\u0094  On the local government level, Cairo Police Commissioner James Dale has announced his policy toward the alien.  He said Wednesday he\u0092s going to make anyone seeing it submit to a breathalizer test for alcohol content. ",
