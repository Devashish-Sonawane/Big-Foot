            "Observed": "This occurred southeast of Orlando. I was attending an on-site meeting for a new construction project in a very remote and undeveloped area southeast of Orlando. During the meeting, I kept noticing movement in the trees about 150 to 200 yards to the east of our group. I started to pay more attention, and began to realize that this was not a person or animal that I had seen before. It was far too large. It seemed to be ducking in and out behind the trees watching us. It never made a sound and after a couple of minutes, it turned and walked away on two legs into the thicker vegetation. After the meeting, I walked over to the area where I last saw it and the undergrowth was crushed down and you could see where something had passed through. I went to the last tree I saw it at and compared to the limbs on the tree, this thing was at least 7.5 to 8 feet tall. I am 6'2\" and could barely reach the limbs that were at the same height as this creature's head. No one else in the group seemed to notice and I didn't say anything as we were in a high profile professional meeting and I did not want to draw attention to the fact that I thought I was seeing a bigfoot. It would not have been a good thing for my employment situation. I have returned to the area several times as construction has continued, but I have not had any other sightings of this creature.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the gentleman on the telephone for quite a while.  He has not told anyone about his sighting for fear of ridicule and ostracism. His apprehensiveness was real and adds to the honesty and credibility of this report.The witness had a meeting on September 15, 2011 at the location, at 10 AM in the morning. On the way to the meeting in a remote area, he had seen turkey and deer in the area. The property had been clear cut two to three days prior to the meeting. While meeting with 10 or 15 men at the location, he noticed movement along the tree line about 100 - 150 yards away.  As the meeting progressed he watched what he thought at first was a hunter go from tree to tree, peek around it, obviously watching them.  It eventually stepped out from a tree, and then he realized it wasn\u0092t a hunter.  He found it very startling that it was a bipedal creature covered in hair.  It then took three steps, and just seemed to disappear, camouflaging totally into the trees. He said it walked away \"like it didn't have a care in the world,\" seemingly unconcerned that many men were close by.  About 20-30 minutes after the meeting ended, he walked over to the tree line. It was then he realized how big it had been. The witness stands 6\u00922\u0094 and when he held his arm up to a branch he had seen the figure stand head level to, he couldn\u0092t reach it. He estimates the creature was at least 8 feet high. The hair color was not solid \u0096 it seemed to be mostly dark, but with lighter brown and a \u0093rusty\u0094 color mottled through. He also saw a trail through the brush the creature had made when it walked away. He did not feel comfortable going further into the woods. The witness stated he has a friend who is 6\u00927\u0094 and 440 Lbs.  - the bigfoot was much bigger than his friend.  His experience has made him rethink reality and it has taken him months to come to terms with what he saw.  As such a sighting does to most, it has become a life changing experience.The property, 25 acres, is owned by a private utility company, and is bordered by more private land that contains 3000 acres of first growth forest. Bordering the north side of the property is a power line easement (it is believed that sasquatches make use of powerline roads for easy travel) and a major interstate less than a mile away. The east side of this property is wooded land for approximately 20 miles to the St. John\u0092s River. There are also free range cattle throughout the area.Interestingly, although this location is heavily wooded, the Orlando International Airport is 5.5 miles away.  I find it amazing that the 13th busiest airport in the country with 840 daily flights and more than 35 million passengers going through it a year is so close to such a pristine Sasquatch habitat. ",
