The sound was more like the recording found by the Westen Bigfoot Society on the net. Actually, it was exactly like that one. It sent shivers down your back. We were a measured 6 miles N. of state rd. #20 on Rocky Creek Rd. The sound came from approx. .5 to 1 mi. northwest of our campsite. We had noticed for the past couple of hours prior to this that the forest was absolutly quiet. No noise at all.",

The mother believes that she has also been watched from the window. However, when she turned around it was gone. His dad was also under the opinion that the family had been followed home before. They were very concerned about their safety.",
