There is a lot of wilderness to the south, north, west, and east. This is the start of Appalachian Ohio and gets very rugged towards the Ohio River to the East.",

It's a very remote, heavily wooded area that was reclaimed by the state from the strip mining days. The family that owns the property has been nothing but a joy to work with, and have allowed the BFRO full access to the property whenever we want. The only reason I'm classifying this report a \"B\" is because I haven't had the opportunity to talk to the actual witness in person. Sometime in the near future, this report could revert to an \"A\" once the actual witness is met and interviewed for more detail. The property itself has a few other sightings that we know of, and to this day remains very active. A note of importance is that this property is their vacation/retirement property. They're usually down there one or two weekends a month in the spring, summer, and fall and hardly ever in the winter. The area is very close to the Tappan Lake Region.  ",
