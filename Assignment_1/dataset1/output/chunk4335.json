            "Media Issue": "A Gentleman on the South Fork of the Saluda river in a letter of the 23rd sends his correspondent in this city the following description on the Bald Mountains in the Western Territories.  This animal is between twelve and fifteen feet high, and in shape resembling a human being, except the head, which is in equal proportion to its body and drawn in somewhat like a tarapin;  its feet are like those of a negroe, and about two feet long, and hairy, which is of a dark dun colour;  its eyes are exceedingly large, and open and shut up and down its face;  the hair of its head is about six inches long, stands straight like a negroe's;  its nose is what is called Roman.  These animals are bold, and have lately attempted to kill several persons - in which attempt some of them have been shot.  Their principal resort is on the Bald Mountain, where they lay in wait for travellers - but some have been seen in this part of the country.  The inhabitants call it Yahoo;  the Indains, however, give it the name of Chickly Cudly.",
