Frank told us he had a \"special job\" and would consider it a favor if we did it. The developer of Boca Teeca had a couple of hunting cottages, in the everglades, and it wouldn't take us more than a couple of days. We would have to camp over since it was too far to drive and there wasn't any lodging around. Now my wife was over 7 months pregnant and I wasn't crazy about doing the job. However, Frank was persausive, \"If you want to continue working for me you'll do it!\" I didn't have health insurance and was making payments to Bethesda Hospital, in advance, for my wife's upcoming hospital stay. So I caved in and took the job.",

His account did not waver in the slightest in recounting it.  The creature had long, \"whispy\" hair - not fur - that was very sparse.  He was able to see the skin, which appeared to be light colored, \"like a pig.\"  It was dark with only the light of the camp fire, so the color may have been influenced by that fact. The hair appeared to be about 8\" to 10\" in length.  It is my impression that this witness is absolutely credible.  ",
