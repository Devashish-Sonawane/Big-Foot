As we were looking around, we seen this big black bear looking creature. We knew it wasn't a bear, because both my husband and myself are black bear hunters. This creature was about 200 yards away on a open spot on the mountain. It was running away from us at a pretty good pace we figured around 20mph. From were we were standing the creature seemed to be just gliding along at a fast pace. My 13 year old nephew looked at my husband and myself and said \" Boy I never seen a bear running on it's hind legs before, and running that fast.\" My husband is not a firm believer in the unknown but I swear to what I saw was no kind of black bear or animal that I ever saw before. We figured it was around 8 feet tall.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I visited the exact location of the siting the following Saturday of August 1st. I arrived at the location at about 7:30 pm. I camped in the exact location of where the bigfoot was described as running. It was steep terrain, and while I was there the ground was fairly dry. I wasn't leaving a single footprint and I weigh 200 lbs. I only observed some deer tracks that had dug into the ground. I played my harmonica at sundown for about a half hour, trying to attract the curiosity of anything out wandering the woods. At 11:30 pm I was woken by the sounds of something moving about 20 feet from the end of my tent. My tent was in the middle of a clearing, the only other obstruction in this clearing was a patch of three pine trees. From behind these 3 trees I heard a loud exhaling noise, slow and constant. No sounds of movement what so ever. I watched with a nightvision scope but could not see directly behind from where the noise came. After about a minute of listening, I started to talk back, hoping to calm whatever was making the noise. After about another minute, I was pretty scared that whatever it was, it wasn't going away. So I played the harmonica loudly to make a lot of noise. I had put down the night vision scope, to pick up the harmonica. After about 15 seconds of playing the harmonica, the noise had stopped. I observed the trees again for the next hour with the night vision scope and never saw a thing. In speaking with a bear hunter, I learned that bear frequently will exhale loudly to clear their lungs of scent and focus on what they're smelling. So my guess is it was a bear, although I've never heard of a bear hiding behind a tree in perfect stillness...I'm sure its possible. The next morning I found no tracks. ",
