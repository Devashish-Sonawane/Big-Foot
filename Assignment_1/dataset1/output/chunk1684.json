            "Observed": "We were walking in to see Miner's Falls and were approximately a quarter to a third of the way down the trail when we heard a loud banging of wood on wood.  At first we just looked at each other and kept walking.  Then we heard it again and it was a little louder.  We hesitated and I asked her if she heard that.  She said yes.  We looked in the direction of the noise and sure enough.  There was a stick banging back and forth between two trees that were in a growth of trees.  It was a large stick and you could see the end of it very well so it had to be sticking straight out.  I'd guess it was about six and a half feet up the tree you could see it.  Just before the banging stopped there was a glimpse of something dark that couldn't be identified.  It seemed to be standing up from leaning over.  As fast as that, the noise stopped and I wasn't able to see anymore.  My friend didn't even get the glimpse from her angle.  It was clear all the way around that growth of trees so whatever it was, went straight away from us on the other side of those trees.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Miners Falls is a waterfall located on Miners River in the western portion of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore.  The witness and her friend began hearing the wood knocking off and on for about a minute as they walked.  At one point when they looked toward the noise they saw a stick hitting back and forth between two twin trees that were growing together.  This was only about 20 ft. from them.She preferred to refer to the stick as a limb because it was so large. There was about 18 - 24\" between the two trees and they could see the limb knock back and forth between the two trees causing the wood on wood sound they were hearing.  The limb was straight out at a 90 degree angle and this witness believes she saw part of an arm, dark in color.The witness has grown up in Michigan and there was no explanation or animal she knew of that could hold such a large limb, hold it straight out at that height while banging back and forth between two trees.Photo of Miners Falls -",

            "Observed": "We were getting up early to hitch up our travel trailer and start home to Oklahoma.  My wife had gotten up first and then I got up and went into the bathroom.  My wife opened the door and said that someone was standing outside the entry door to the bedroom of the trailer.  I went back to the room and saw a large shadow in the window.  The window is privacy glass so they couldn't see inside.  I could see a chest, a head and about half of the arm.   I reached into the night stand a took out my pistol thinking that it was someone.  I then started toward the back of the trailer to the main entry door.  While I was doing this my wife thought to take photos.  She took 3 photos which does show the shadow of whatever it was very well.  When I was at the other end of the trailer I opened the door and turned on the outside light at the same time.  There was nothing there, I did hear what sounded like someone walking very quickly in the distance.  I went around the trailer but couldn't see anyone.  It was at this time that I realized that the window on the door is too high for someone to have been standing there.  I took pictures to show how high it is.  We waited until daylight to go back outside, I looked around the front and side of the trailer and noticed what appeared to be large tracks in the gravel.  I took pictures of these.  My friend who is a photographer took a copy of the pictures showing the shadow in the window and enlarged them while trying to keep the clarity and it is possible to make out some of the features.  His exact words are \" it kind of looks like Harry from Harry and the Hendersons\".  I don't know what it was but it was very strange and the photos are quite interesting.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I\u0092ve spoken with the submitter of this report, H, numerous times in an effort to cover as many details as possible regarding the incident. His wife, J, is referred to herein as well. The author\u0092s narrative is somewhat restated below so as to include additional, important details within the event timeline.J got up around 4:15 A.M. and went to the bathroom to get ready. After J had left the bathroom and returned to the bedroom, H took his turn in the bathroom. They estimate that he had been in there (bathroom) for two to three minutes. Through these several minutes she watched the figure at the window in a state of \u0093shock\u0094 and disbelief. She then walked to the bathroom to tell H someone was looking into their bedroom. H came out of the bathroom and into the bedroom where he also witnessed the figure. Thinking it was a person, he quietly removed his pistol from the nightstand and proceeded to the other end (back) of the trailer in hopes that he could exit from that end while simultaneously turning on the outside light, thus catching the culprit in the act. While making his way to the other door, H attempted to be as quiet as possible as well as to not cause any movement of the trailer. During his progression through the trailer, H chambered a round into his semi-auto pistol while J took the photos. Total time from when he came out of the bathroom to when he got to the other door is estimated at one and a half to two minutes, putting the total time of the figure being observed peering in the window at between three and a half and five minutes. Upon reaching the back door, H flipped on the outside light (the light located near the bedroom door) as he opened the back door and stepped out. H fully expected to see their visitor at this point but there was no one in sight. He did, however, hear bipedal footsteps exiting down the gravel road to the east at a brisk pace. After checking around the trailer, H realized that it couldn\u0091t have been a person standing there due to the height of the window and decided to take some pictures for reference. He then went back inside to wait for daybreak. After sunrise H and J went back outside to look for any signs the intruder might have left. They found a couple of impressions in the gravel which resembled large human footprints, estimated at between fourteen and sixteen inches long. Though these were also photographed, they are not included here due to difficulty in making out the details.Also noted:- H and J were the only two people in their trailer.- They had spent six nights at the same location and had not noticed anything unusual prior to this incident.- When H opened the back door, he did not see anyone else outside but did hear dogs barking in the adjacent trailer.- Their trailer was in the last (west) space on the row. The figure appeared on the west side of their bedroom so it wouldn\u0092t have been between two trailers.- Figure was somewhat backlit by a street light near a building approximately 200-250 feet to the west/northwest of their location.- They had left the bedroom television on all night, as they normally do. For reference, I asked H to turn on the television and see if the flashing of the screen could be seen from outside, through the privacy glass. He confirmed that it could, but that you could not actually see into the trailer from the outside.- The creature did not make any noises while at the window.- The step below the bedroom door was retracted and no movement was felt in the trailer which would indicate the visitor was standing on the ground, not the step. There was also nothing else nearby to stand on.- Measured height from the ground to the top of the window (where figure was photographed) is eight feet. Glass pane is sixteen inches wide by twenty-four inches high.- Track observed, closest to the trailer, was approximately three feet away.- J's reasons for photographing the figure were that she believed it was possibly somebody that meant them harm, also that it was so strange to see someone standing at the window.- Photos were taken with a JVC GZ-MS100 camcorder in digital photo mode. - H and J did not speak of the encounter with anyone else in the campground prior to departing.- There were numerous other people in RV\u0092s occupying the campground.Due to the dark nature of the original photos,  we created this .gif to enhance the viewability of one of the images:This photo was taken after the figure departed and the witness realized how large it actually was:Another view of the bedroom door and window after sunrise. Measurement to top of window also shown:I personally visited this location to get a better understanding of the general area and surroundings. There is an abundance of cover to the south, with a heavily treed mountain rising up directly behind the stream. It is definitely plausible, particularly in cover of darkness, that something could easily approach and exit the area undetected. The location of this report is within the 1,507,000 acre Carson National Forest. Elevations range from approximately 7,000 feet to 13,161 feet at Wheeler Peak, New Mexico\u0092s highest point. Thick spruce, fir, aspen, ponderosa pine and juniper forests as well as rugged terrain dominate the surrounding landscape. Wildlife and water sources are plentiful.",
