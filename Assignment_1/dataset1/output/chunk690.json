            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness attributes his repeated encounters to the fact that he was out on the river most of the time, it being his livelihood. He mentioned other events. He was fishing from the bank and heard noises behind him in the narrow band of forest between the river and the road. He saw what he thought were two bears. One of them disappeared immediately, the other \"bear\" stepped behind a tree, though both of its arms could be seen holding on to the tree. Shortly afterwards, when he and a nearby fisherman had returned to the road and were talking with a few more fishermen, an alder in the adjacent thick forest, not more than 20-30' away, was vigorously shaken back and forth.The sasquatch that \"porpoised\" in front of his fishing friend, evidently jumped vertically out of the water in front of that person, wetting him down thoroughly, but immediately dove under again as the water is approximately 15' there.The witness also mentioned that it appears that the sasquatch hunts the salmon underwater, partly for the reason of the jumping of the fish, partly because of his repeated, unverified impressions of a sasquatch swimming past the boat under water.",

We had come through a heavily forested area to a spot where a creek meets the river, a gravel bar extends some 500 yards downstream from this point, and is about 150 yards wide. The airstrip is just above this area. there is a line of young alders that parallels the river, with a sandy spot around the upstream end. The prints were coming from the direction of the forest we had just come through and heading toward the river. The forest continued on the other side. We did not cross. There were other animal tracks, mostly deer, and a possible mountain lion track.",
