What he heard that day was high and loud but not as high as an elk.  The sound would start high then drop off low and rough at the end like a growl.  He is familiar with animal sounds but hasn't witnessed anything like this before or since. Over the years he has heard stories of sounds and sightings from this area.  He believes these creatures are real and takes a camera with him hoping to someday see and photograph one.",
