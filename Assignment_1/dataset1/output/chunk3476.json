I was born in Longview, Washington and spent much of my childhood exploring the surrounding area with my friends and family.  From camping out at Spirit Lake to spending time on my Grandparents farm.  It was on their farm that the following incident occurred.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Interviewed the witness, D.W., at length on May 22, 2002.  One item that was left out of this account was the age of the witness, who was about 10 years old at the time of the incident.  In addition, the witness added a couple of interesting details during the interview.  He noted that the mouth of the animal was very wide, stretching well back on the jaw as opposed to the thinner mouth that is usually noted.  The witness also noted that the eyes of the animal that he was looking at were located very close together, much more so than human eye sockets.  Although he did not get a very good look at the second animal that was directly behind him, the witness does believe that it was darker in color than the one next to the stream.",
