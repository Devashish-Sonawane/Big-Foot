            "Observed.1  ": "Coleman has been gathering information for the past eight years on the fascinating subject. He describes the \u0093unknown anthropoids\u0094 in this region as averaging three to four feet in length, with long black or dark gray hair covering the entire body except for the face and hands. Coleman pointed to the book, \u0093Abominable Snowmen,\u0094 written by Ivan T. Sanderson, and quoted a description of the species that supposedly reside in the Midwest. The book said the creatures ranged in size from just a little smaller than the average human being to tiny, clothed in thick black or red fur but with differentiated head-hair that usually forms a mane. It said they have a primitive form of language, are good tree climbers and swimmers, with their toes subequal and heels small or pointed. The snowmen are \u0093omnivorous, insect, fish and small animal eaters,\u0094 Sanderson wrote. In another section of the book, Sanderson divided North American snowmen into two groups: those of giants who live across the top of the U.S. and down the western mountains that are known as \u0093Sasquatch\u0094 or \u0093Bigfoot\u0094; second, the much smaller \u0093little red men of the bottomlands\u0094 from the Mississippi River drainage region. Gathers Information The SIU student has amassed scores of letters, newspaper articles and individual interviews to help back his theory that \u0093an undiscovered species of anthropoids who are high in numbers exist throughout the backwoods and uncharted swamps of middle America.\u0094 \u0093I am very serious about this matter,\u0094 Coleman, a member of the Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained, said. \u0093There is, indeed, something-most likely an unknown primate-in this area and through the swampy and wooded waterweb that covers 40 per cent of the United States.\u0094 He said films of similar beasts in the Pacific Northwest may back up the theory of a creature of an unknown variety and that he hopes to get pictures and plaster casts of footprints of the beasts in this section of the country. The earliest sighting Coleman has documented was reported in the Memphis Enquirer in 1851. The article, entitled \u0093Wild Man of the Woods,\u0094 described something \u0093bearing an unmistakable likeness of humanity.\u0094 The story said the man was \u0093of gigantic stature, the body being covered with hair, and the head with long locks that fairly enveloped the neck and shoulders.\u0094 When the \u0093wildman\u0094 saw a pair of hunters, it turned and ran away, leaping \u0093from twelve to fourteen feet at a time.\u0094  The creature\u0092s footprints measured 13 inches. Mt. Vernon \u0091beast\u0092 In 1942, the Carbondale Free Press reported that a squirrel hunter near Mt. Vernon was approached by a half-man beast. The creature had jumped over his head knocking off his hat and dislodging the pipe from his mouth. When it came towards him, the hunter (an ordained minister) fired his gun and frightened it away. Mt. Vernon authorities organized a massive hunt to track down the beast, whose tracks \u0093were similar to a raccoon\u0092s but four times as large.\u0094 The paper reported that \u0093sometimes two tracks have been found, sometimes four.\u0094 Its screaming was compared to that of a wildcat. \u0093The beast must have got news of the big hunt, for reports started coming in of its appearance in other creek bottoms, some as much as 40 or 50 miles from the original site,\u0094 the journal \u0093Hoosier Folklore,\u0094 reports. A man driving near the Big Muddy River, in Jackson County, one night saw the beast bound across the road. Some hunters saw evidence of its presence in Okaw, \u0093Its rapid changing from place to place must have been aided considerably by its ability to jump, for, by this time, reports had it jumping along at from 20 to 40 feet per leap,\u0094the journal added. The hunt failed with the hunters bagging \u0093a large hoot owl and several crows.\u0094 Author Jared Sparks of East Lansing, Mich., said under the heading \u0093Missouri Monster Tale\u0094, that in that state\u0092s south-eastern swamps, and animal was loose which could kill and rip up full-size cows and horses. No one was able to identify the monster even after it was shot and killed. \u0093It was something like a gorilla,\u0094 he said. Coleman interviewed Bob Earle from Decatur in November, 1962, and learned that two men had seen a large, gray animal standing upright in the middle of a creek east of Decatur, off East William Street Road, \u0093They felt it was definitely not a bear,\u0094 Coleman said. \u0091Half-man thing\u0092 Under the headline \u0093Half-man \u0091thing\u0092 baffles St.Louis, \u0094 the Chicago Daily News reported in May of 1963 that witnesses and a patrolman saw \u0093something near a housing project.\u0094 Centreville police received over 50 phone calls reporting a monster. James McKinney said \u0093It was in front of my house and was half-man, half horse.\u0094 The Decatur Review published a story Sept. 22, 1965, dealing with four young persons who claimed a black, man-like monster approached their car. Headlined \u0093youths report \u0091monster\u0092 near edge of city.\u0094 the article said the young men took their companions back to Decatur and returned armed with shotguns, to see if \u0093it\u0094 returned. \u0093It\u0094 did. They left, hurriedly.\u0094 During August, 1968, Robert R. Lynn of KXOK News, St. Louis, told of a 22-year-old woman who claimed that an animal had grabbed her four-year-old nephew in the backyard of her house in Kinlock, Mo. \u0093She saw it and screamed. The dog went after \u0093It\u0094. \u0093It\u0094 dropped the boy and fled into the woods,\u0094 Lynn told Coleman in an interview. When police searched the woods, they found nothing. The news announcer said the woman described the thing as looking like a bear. Upon seeing a model of a gorilla the next day, the boy said \u0093it\u0094 looked like the gorilla, Lynn added. Chittyville \u0091What\u0092s it\u0092 Tagged \u009310-foot-tall \u0091what\u0092s it\u0092 reported seen,\u0094 a Southern Illinoisan article in 1965 told of a \u0093thing\u0094 roaming the woods near Chittyville. A guy and his date met the creature Aug. 11 while they were driving northeast of Chittyville, an unincorporated area north of Herrin. Upon seeing the thing, the woman started screaming. She described it as \u0093huge, about ten-feet-tall, with a head as large as a steering wheel.\u0094 Although the driver said he did not see it, he returned to the area the next day and found a depression in the grass, \u0093indicating a large animal had rested or slept there.\u0094 Appearing in the April issue of Argosy, 1969, the article, \u0093Wisconsin\u0092 \u0091Abominable Snowman\u0092\u0094 told of 12 deer hunters who all saw \u0093something black\u0085they didn\u0092t shoot, it was manlike.\u0094 The article describes the creature as \u0093a large and powerfully built man covered with short, very brown or black hair and with a lighter and hairless face and hairless palms. The head appeared smallish, also with short hair, but the neck appeared to be enormous and so short as to be almost nonexistent. The shoulders were very wide and large and the torso barrel-shaped.\u0094 Although some of the reports contradicted Coleman\u0092s assumption that the midwestern species were small, he explained that these animals were interlopers, migrating through the region. \u0091No cause for alarm\u0092 He emphasizes that he sees no cause for alarm concerning the reports. \u0093No harm has come to any human being in all the reports gathered,\u0094 he says. \u0094 What I find is a pattern of intelligent primate behavior, a mixture of curiosity and communication. \u0093These are not reports of one escaped orang or a wandering hermit, but a cross-section of an undiscovered species of anthropoids that are high in numbers.\u0094 Coleman hopes that through this article, area residents will know \u0093there is someone who will listen to their claims of \u0091hairy monsters\u0092 and so forth, and not ask them if they had been drinking.\u0094 His address is 202 East College, Carbondale. Researching the existence of abominable snowmen is embarrassing to many of his colleagues, Coleman said, \u0093Since it is still in the area of myth, it is disgraceful and not \u0091nice\u0092 to talk about,\u0094 he explained. Science, today, is really not in pursuit of the unknown, he proposes, \u0093It\u0092s simply re-researching old material.\u0094 The SIU senior said science is slowly realizing it must listen to common folks. \u0093Unfortunately, reporters and sheriffs often just laugh them off. They are disregarded because they are not educated in the field,\u0094 he said. Coleman also files accounts of bear or large cat sightings. He feels that many people, upon seeing strange beasts, interpret them into known animals. He pulled out an article from the Cairo Evening Citizen reporting a black panther being spotted in Alexander County in April of 1966, as evidence of his claim. Joseph Moad, who lives about four and one half miles west of Elco, \u0093shot at a mysterious beast shortly after 8 p.m.,\u0094 the story reported. \u0093I turned on a flood light and could see his eyes shining.\u0094  Moad said, \u0093He screamed and it was the keen scream of a panther, not the coarse scream of a bobcat or cougar,\u0094 he added. Moad said he has heard screams of both bobcats and panthers and was certain this was the yell of a panther. The cry of a panther has been likened to the shrill scream of a woman, the article said. Beast\u0092s legend Sightings of large bears and big cats, as well as man-like creatures are all recorded by Loren Coleman to pinpoint the creature\u0092s most likely hideout. He has kept files on the other animals to insure that the abominable snowmen (ABSM) are not incorrectly identified.",
