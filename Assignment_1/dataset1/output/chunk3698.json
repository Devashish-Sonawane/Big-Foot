            "Observed": "My brother and I were driving back home from a fishing trip when suddenly a small deer ran across the road in front of us. I stopped the car and out of the corner of my eye I saw a large dark shape on the passenger side of the road. I quickly turned to look at it. It was the biggest animal I had ever seen. The first thing I noticed was the glowing red eyes. Its fur or hair was clumped and matted. Its back was covered with what appeared to be layers of dark matted hair. There was less hair on its shoulders and lower body. I could see the muscle definition in the front part of its body. It was hunched over. I noticed cinnamon colored hair on its back. It appeared to be grinning and had a grey hairless face. Its eyes were sunken in and had a flat nose and a slightly protruding jaw. It appeared to be very old. It didn't move for the longest time and was as still as a statue. When it did eventually decide to leave it watched us the whole time as it jumped over the guard rail and disappeared down the embankment into the thick brush. I got the sense that it was smarter than an average animal.",
