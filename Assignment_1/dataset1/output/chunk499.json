He emphasized the volume and power of the sound, and said it had the power of four animals put together. The sound started as a deep gutteral growl and grew steadily in volume and tone, to a sound that was abnormally long and loud. The other two witnesses reacted to the vocalization with expressions of surprise and fear. One said, \"We dont want to mess with that critter\". The witness thought the vocalization may have been a reaction to them emerging from the cave opening.Chickamauga National Battlefield is in the area and has a long history of strange encounters with something known as \"Green Eyes\". References to \"Green Eyes\" can be found elsewhere on the internet. ",
