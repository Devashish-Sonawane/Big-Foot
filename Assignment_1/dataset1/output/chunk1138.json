            "Follow-Up Report": "Talked with Neil on the evening of May 6, 2010, who was very credible in the retelling of his story, and we went over his encounter which had numerous tracks around a horse pasture and then they headed up a very steeply graded hill that was located on one side of that pasture. The witness was extramurally excited to finally get a chance to tell his story after 34 years of holding it back. His father had advised him to keep this story to himself, because it would bring him nothing but trouble somewhere down the line.This group of deer hunters who were finished hunting for the day, decided to go over to his friend's uncle's ranch in which there was a cabin on it, to eat lunch and rest. Snow had recently fallen and the ground was still a mixture of snow &mud. They viewed some hogs in their pen and they decided to feed them some apples they were going to eat for lunch.  During lunch, they were hearing several of the uncle's horses going wild in the back part of the ranch property, which had to have lasted well about 30 minutes, while they were feeding the hogs. The horses continued on raising such a ruckus that they just had to stop what they were doing and go back to where the four horses were located to find out what was going on with them!On their arrival at the horse pasture area they viewed some very large tracks through this metal gate; that were approximately 18 inches in length and from 5 1/2\" to 6\" wide as measured by Neil's size 15 boot. These tracks ran around the outside of the pasture where there were 4 horses going around and around in circles jumping and bucking, and making vocal sounds as in crying and screaming. The depths of these tracks were well over 4 inches deep, and they ran for well over 250 feet around this pasture, and continuing on up this very steep hill next to the horse pasture fence.  One of the guys viewed air bubbles still coming up from the muddy part of the tracks which caused him to say, \"Boy, these tracks are fresh\".This witness thinks that this creature had to have weighed well over 900lbs., because Neil stepped next to this track, to see just how much weight it would take to get a track 4\" deep in that mud and snow. Neil said he could only get about 1\" deep as he weighed in at about 275 lbs.  Neil said that the tracks were for the most part, in a straight line, and there were about 40 plus inches between the tracks, toe to heal. He noted that the toes were thick. This creature had to have just left that area, because its stink was still very prevalent as it smelled something like a dirty wet dog that had rolled in rotten eggs, or even worse. At first, they all had a difficult time figuring out just what kind of a creature could have made these tracks.What really impressed Neil, was how this creature transcended this steep 70% grade hill that was located up and behind the horse pasture fence. This creature put one foot up, which was about 2 1/2 to 3' up, and into this dirt hill, pushing its forward part of its foot into the side of this hill, with no other prints or tracks observed, it then proceeded on up this steep hill taking at least four other steps as it moved forward up this hill. He and several of his friends attempted to follow, but could not stay up right, as this creature had to have.In Summary: I do believe that Neil and his friends had a large Sasquatch on that ranch property while he and his friends were out in front feeding apples to the hogs, because of the way the horses were acting, the fresh foul odors that were still emanating close to where the tracks were located around the horse pasture, and then the air bubbles still emanating from the muddy part of those large five toed tracks. Note, all measurements were only approximate as they didn't have any measuring devices. Neil still seemed skeptical that sasquatches were a real creature until several years later when he had the chance to view the film \"The Legend of Boggy Creek\" where they proclaimed that this story was taken from folks who believed it was a real creature.",
