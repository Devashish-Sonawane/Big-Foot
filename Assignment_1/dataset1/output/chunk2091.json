There were also prints found in other areas of the state park and near Bel Air road. There was even a story I heard about a whole family on Whitt Rd. (right down the street) that had seen an 8 ft. tall creature on their back porch one night watching them eat dinner. When they started screaming, it took off. Also, all my friends and myself have grown up in the woods, and for years we\u0092ve found mutilated remains of deer strewn everywhere (possibly by cougar) but I have doubts a cougar could do this sort of thing. I've also heard stories from a man that\u0092s lived in the neighborhood his whole entire life, and when he was younger his friends and him seen what they believed to be a sasquatch numerous times around the power lines, but it's been a long time since I've heard the stories, so I don't remember the exact details, but I can still get in touch with the man.",

            "Observed": "Back in 1992 I was bear hunting with a buddy of mine in the area around the town of Lewiston. We had 4 bear bait sites in about a 30 mile radius. One of the sites was located in Red Oak Township. Every time we would go to this site I had this strange feeling like I was being watched or something. It was spooky. One day just before bear season started I was checking this particular bait pile alone. There was a two track road that wound through the woods up a hill and then down to a swamp. The two track ended at a trail which I would park at the head of and then walk down with two 5 gallon buckets of bear bait which usually consisted of meat scraps and pastries. On this particular day I had just dumped the bait on the bait pile and was walking up the path to my truck. The cover was fairly thick but thined out the closer you came to the two track. I was about 60 yards in from the two track and could see it when something very strange happened. I creature of some sort I would say about 7 to 8 feet tall walked across the two track. This creature crossed the two track in one step. I have seen bears and run across bears in the woods before but I can say for sure this was definitely not a bear. I was so startled that I just stopped in my tracks and said to myself, \"what in the he** was that?\" I walked closer to where the creature crossed I kept getting the overwhelming feeling of fear. When I got to the spot where I thought this creature had crossed I stopped and looked in the direction in which the creature had walked looked. about 30 feet or so behind a large cedar tree I could make out what appeared to be a a face which was defintly not a bear but not a man either. It looked kind of black like a mountain gorilla would. I thought I was seeing things so I kind of blinked a few times but it was still there after about 15 seconds the creature turned away from me and disappeared into the woods. All the time this was happening I just could not shake this feeling of dread or doom. I have hunted and fished all over the state of Michigan and have never been afraid of anything that I have encountered but this really shook me.",
