            "Follow-Up Report": "Met with witness R.B. at his workplace.  He showed me photos of broken/twisted alder trees that he found in his hunting area.  He described strange noises and ususual events that occurred and are mentioned in the sighting report above.  In addition to the \"whoop-whoop\" noises, he describes a \"scream/holler\" that he heard, as well as being charged by a terrified deer, and seeing a nearby tree suddenly fall.  He also described heavy, bipedal footsteps that he heard from the nearby thickets, and related the palpable sensation of being watched.  He also felt a menacing presence which prompted him to immediately leave the area, but not before he discovered a very fresh and very large animal scat lying in the middle of the logging road.He gathered a 6\" piece of the much larger scat, which he described as smelling so strongly that he could barely approach it, much less pick it up.  He froze the scat as soon as he got home and gave me the scat for examination.  It appears to consist principally of animal fur that is compressed into disc-like sections.  It has an intensely foul odor even when frozen.  He also found a few reddish-brown hairs, 4\" to 5\" long in a tree which he saved and gave me for analysis.  He thought they may be deer or elk.  While one is seldom certain, I consider the constellation of events described by the witness as being consistent with bigfoot/sasquatch activity.  Hair analysis is forthcoming.  Witness is eager to return to the site and to attempt to gather more evidence, and  to try some baiting and other attraction strategies that might precipitate a visual sighting.",
