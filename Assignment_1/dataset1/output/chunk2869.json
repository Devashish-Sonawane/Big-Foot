            "Observed": "Just after dark I decided to go to the park for some night fishing. Pulled over before I got to the lake to urinate. I stepped just into the woods and began to take care of business. I then heard something walking through the woods towards me. I could hear the leaves crushing as it came my way as if it was walking with heavy steps. I decided it would be a good idea to get out of there so I started back for my truck. Then the noise became louder, like jogging or running. I ran, jumped in my truck and began driving. I watched my rearview mirror and all I could see was something big and dark standing on two legs come into the road behind me. I wasn't about to stop and see for sure what it was.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness via telephone about his encounter.  The witness told me that he had stopped at approximately 2130 hours on the side of the road and gone into the woods to relieve himself when he heard \"leaves crushing and heavy footsteps.\"  At first he thought it was a \"dog or something,\" but as he listened it sounded \"too heavy to be a dog\" and sounded bipedal.  The witness said he became scared and began making his way back to his truck which was about 20 yards away.  He hurriedly walked through the woods to get to his truck parked on the side of the road.  The witness said that every time he stopped walking, the thing that was \"stalking\" him would also stop.  The witness finally made it to his truck and he heard the thing begin to run toward him.  The witness said he immediately started his truck and began to drive off quickly.  As he looked in his rearview mirror, he saw a \"big, dark figure\" that appeared taller than his truck just standing in the middle of the road.  The figure was within 10 yards of his tailgate and appeared \"wide and thick\".  The witness said that he could discern no other details.    ",
