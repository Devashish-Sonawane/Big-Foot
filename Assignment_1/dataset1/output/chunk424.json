            "Observed": "At about 9:30 at night, I was back in an area Near Lake Asbury where there is a Church camp in the woods. It was dark, but there was enough light to see what I saw. It was about 8' tall, and was running straight across from me about 50' away. It was covered with black, shaggy hair. Its head was kind of dome-like, and its shoulders were very big. It appeared to be trotting, and its shoulders twisted back and forth as it ran, but its arms hung straight down at its sides, not pumping back and forth like a human's would. Its arms hung down nearly to its knees. I saw it and watched it for about 7 seconds. I started shaking, because we had talked about this creature in class, and I immediately knew what I had seen. About a minute later, I smelled this horrible smell that smelled like a wet, nasty pig pen after a rain (we have pigs so I'm sure of the smell). About 5 minutes later I heard some hooting noises. They were quite loud, and there were about 3 hoots one after another, then a pause of about 2 seconds, then about 3-4 more hoots. It sounded similar to some of the Bigfoot sounds, hoots, we listened to in my Biology class, but they were longer.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This area is a rather isolated scrub and high pine ecosystem, characterized by tall sand pines rising above an understory of scrub oaks, holly, bay, hickory, and wax myrtle. It is pretty typical Florida landscape, with houses built on rather large wooded lots, many of them on the lake, or on Black Creek.Within days of this sighting, I visited this site with the witness. It is a church camp on a small, drying-up finger pond that is contiguous with a larger lake. The sighting was exactly 53' from witness to creature. The light was ambient for the 21:30 sighting, from outside lights at various locations throughout the camp, and would have been ample to illuminate as described. The tracks that the witness described were in sand, and unfortunately, were indiscriminate. The unusual, yet previously reported gait of the creature that the witness described, insinuates authenticity, as it has been rarely described elsewhere, and it was determined from the interview with the witness that such a description would likely have never been seen before by the witness. After thorough questioning, by this investigator, the following information is hereby affirmed;-The witness saw a bipedal creature of approximately 8' in height, trot along the edge of a wooded area, from 53' away.  -The sighting lasted approximately 7 seconds.-The creature was covered with black shaggy hair.-The creature had a dome shaped head, with no visible neck.-The witness heard a series of hooting sounds shortly after the sighting, that the witness noted, sounded like actual Bigfoot sounds he had previously listened to on BFRO.net.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On the evening of the 28th of May 2004, the witnesses called me, and we went over their report that was turned into the BFRO on May 24, 2004. The area of the incident was located in the Pinewood Cove Resort Campground, which is north of Hwy. 299 on Hwy 3 next to Clair Engel Lake.It was about 2 a.m. on their second night at this campground, when they crawled into their beds in their rented fifth wheel trailer, and turned in. About thirty minuets later, \"L\" heard this creature walking down the hill behind their trailer to her side, and stop just outside. \"A\" said that all of their trailer windows were wide open, because it was such a warm summer night.  He continued saying that \"L\" finally got him to wake up, and told him that something was outside of their trailer.  \u0093When I came to my senses, from being awakened, that\u0092s when whatever it was outside stepped on our trailer step, and caused the trailer to move, and the step to squeak at that same instant.\u0094  \"A\" continued saying, \u0093we were both in a high state of fear\u0094, and that \u0093the both us were sweating, and shaking profusely from the fear of what was outside\u0094, and that \u0093our trailer door was about to be opened.\u0094I also asked \"L\" about her side of the incident, and she said, \u0093The footsteps were from a large bipedal creature, because when the foot hit the ground it made a loud thumping sound, and I heard them at least eight times.\u0094  She continued saying, \u0093when the creature moved from my side of the trailer to the side where the step was, it never made a sound, and that\u0092s when I thought this movement showed me that this creature had some kind of intelligence.\u0094   She went on saying that their little dog \u0093always barked when someone moved inside or outside of the trailer, but on this occasion it never made a sound, and I knew it was awake because I could see its little eyes were wide open and they were glowing.\u0094   Received the following, 4-25-05, through the bfro web site:SUBJECT: Report # 8729 submitted to Richard in 2004, updated, 2005, and the report writer wanted to clarify his report with a few more details.  COMMENT: Hello Richard: I wanted to clarify what we felt when something stepped on our trailer step in the middle of the night. It may have no significance, but just wanted to clarify. Again the story is true! At the time you called I admit I was a bit excited to final be able to talk with someone who would hear what I experienced. The area was forested and our campsite was in a private area of the campground. The keeper of the campground was a 60 yrs. old gentleman who kept to himself by his demeanor, which I noticed, and he didn't weigh more than 120 pounds. The other campers in the area were on the mountainous hills above us around 75 yards away, which was fairly steep with a narrow dirt road that snaked its way down. The campers kept to themselves and I had noticed they had extended family, older grandparents with middle-aged people and a few small children. We were all there on vacation and wanted to spend time with our love ones and it was evident by the atmosphere of the campground. We arrived with my wife's family consisting of six people and her father and his girlfriend who had his own R.V. a little ways away. That night which is still vivid in my mind, but which my wife doesn't want to hear every time I bring it up, LOL. We had a campfire going and were pretty loud enjoying our trip, sitting by the fire cracking jokes and talking about life. That night I decided to scare everyone and went behind the fence, which separated our site from the maintenance area. I began breathing heavy with various snorts and even growled a few times. MAN, I tell you I did get the biggest kick seeing everyone\u0092s face through the fence and wish I had a camera to get all the expressions on everyone\u0092s face, that was definitely priceless! After that though the fun was over everyone got scared and didn't want to sit around the fire, call me a party-pooper!The report I gave takes over from here, and is very accurate. When \"something\" stepped on the trailer, the sound when it stepped was just a regular sounding step. Meaning the step squeaked when pressure was applied like a person. The thing was though, what made it so eerie was the movement of the trailer. You see I was awake by then, after being shook by my wife. Moment\u0092s prior to the step I was sitting up in the bed, listening for what my wife described. My dog was quiet, and I felt reassured that nothing was there but then the, step, and the step did not match the movement of the trailer. I saw the whole trailer shake. I was at home when the Loma Perita earthquake of '89 took place, and remember the way everything swayed and the trailer movement was similar, and is the only thing I can use as a reference. The motion of the trailer is why we were so terrified, and the step was too, but we wondered who would be so brazen to do that.  We thought of the people we knew, and so we asked them in the morning, and no one stopped what they were doing and said \"no\" with not even a shrug of interest. If a human did that, they would have had to be jumping up and down on the step, and then it would have been easy to identify the incident has human in nature. All lights were off in the trailer, besides us, the closest campers to us also had their lights off. The more I think about it I'm convinced of what I think it was. There is no other explanation for it, my wife heard padded footsteps and is 100% percent credible, my dog made no effort to bark, which is very strange, because as I sit here typing she is sniffing at the air and growling at the cats that travel through my backyard. Again I remember the way the trailer shook and swayed, and it did not match the step, which seemed cautious and slow. Everything in the report was accurate but just thought the actually step was not described enough in detail and feel it's the one of the most pertinent parts of the report.Summery:  Neither one of them smelled anything strange or heard any heavy breathing and/or any other sound from this creature.  Also, at the time, they never really thought about a bigfoot creature, but now they are not so sure. They just know that it wasn\u0092t a bear, or anything else that they knew about. L.S. asked me if it was important to state that it was her time of the month, and I told her, \u0093Yes!\u0094 Because, that\u0092s what probably caused this creature to stop on her side of the trailer first.  She appreciated that. L.S. told me that the fear factor dissipated in about thirty or so minuets, and they slowly closed the bedroom windows and then fell asleep. What I came away with after talking with the both of them was the fact that this incident was still so very vivid in their minds after three years. I have a hard time saying in fact that this was a sasquatch, but it very well could have been, so I will have to leave that decision up to the reader.    Per the update, the report writer, also wanted to remove he and his wife\u0092s names from the report, due to business considerations.",
