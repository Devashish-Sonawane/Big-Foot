            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness, TW, by phone for over an hour and found him to be sincere and reliable in his statements. He offered some further information about the sighting he experienced. It was about 4:15pm when he and his brother parted to hunt in different parts of the woods. Sometime after settling down TW saw a bipedal, hair-covered creature walk in front of him.He stated that it was--Approximately 6\u0092-7\u0092 tall. Lanky and thin, at about 180-200lbs. -Its hair was light brown, about two inches in length, shaggy in some areas, and TW could see it visibly flowing, or moving while it walked.-It was long-legged, with arms that extended below the knees. -It had a higher waistline than a human. -The shoulder width was approximate to a human of that size, 14\u0094-18\u0094. -The face was not seen head-on, but on a 45% partial view, and was described as being a \u0091pug face\u0092, or flattened. -When asked to describe the shape of the head, the witness stated that it was hard to tell because of the hair, which looked draped over the shoulders.-The witness stated the same with the muscle definition. The hair covered any details about the body mass, except that it was thin and lanky.-The ears, or the details of the fingers could not be seen because of the hair.-There was no odor or sounds associated with the sighting.-The gender of the creature was not obvious.-The sighting lasted approximately 2-3 minutes and during that time, TW did not think that the creature knew he was there. He stated that it never looked at him and that there was no indication that it was excited, or aggressive. It merely walked into his range of vision, about 30 yards away, and kept walking until it was out of sight.-It walked much like a human except the swing of its arms opposed the swing of its legs. -The stride was described to be much like a human stride, except for the length. Later investigation by the witness and brother found impressions that measured a stride length between 5\u0092-6\u0092 long. The track impressions were not adequate to determine a foot size since it occurred over heavy leaf-litter and grass-matted areas.The witness followed up by telling me that when he saw this creature he was too \u0091stunned\u0092 to do anything but watch it. After it left his field of vision, he called out to his brother and eventually his brother came.  He arrived too late to see the creature but his brother did not doubt what TW told him. He also told me that the area has many caves and that it is very remote. Within a few weeks of this sighting, his grown nephew stated that he saw a bipedal, hair-covered creature within this same area.",

Don had a 12-gauge shotgun and I had a 22-gauge rifle. I had seen a fair amount of squirrel activity around while fishing at a nearby farm pond and thought we would make this a fruitful trip. This is rural America with the nearest town of 1,000 just 15 miles away. It is also a farming community with large fields dotting the countryside and woods separating the fields. The area we planed to hunt is made up of mostly hardwood trees with cypress trees down near the river that flowed through the property.",

We feel that this is a legitimate report, and that the witness is credible, and reliable. This is an unusual report because this particular sasquatch openly confronted the two young men (who were both armed) in broad daylight. One can only speculate as to what motivated the animal to approach two humans so boldly. The only obvious reason would be to intimidate the two intruders into vacating the area. It is likely that this individual had used this behavior to its advantage before, and had developed a strategy for certain confrontational situations.  This report is not the only one that the BFRO is aware of involving a sasquatch that approached in broad daylight. There is a very credible unpublished report from White County, Georgia, that describes a large male sasquatch exhibiting similar behavior. ",
