            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness at length by phone. Both he and his wife (now in their 60's) saw the bigfoot back in 1986.  They got a good look at in their headlights as it crossed Interstate 25 heading west. They were only 40 feet away so when they passed it.The location of the incident is notable. Interstate 25 parallels the Rio Grande River as it flows south through New Mexico. Although the immediate area looks like desert the elevation is actually 5,000 feet. It is high desert. Roughly 10 miles to the west is the higher Magdalena Mountains and then the Gila National Forest -- both alpine forests reaching up to 10,000 feet. That is the direction the bigfoot was headed.The Bosque del Apache Wildlife Refuge is significant because during the winter it is loaded with hundreds of thousands of migratory geese, cranes, ducks, etc.  The US Gov has feed plots all around the refuge to support the wintering birds. The sighting happened on Christmas Eve.Bigfoots and their tracks have been found repeatedly near other high desert locations that host large colonies of migratory geese and ducks in winter, such as the San Juan River in Shiprock, NM.It's a safe bet to suggest that bigfoots prey upon these migratory flocks in certain areas. I have approached wintering flocks like these near Shiprock in winter at night.  With the cover of rushing river noise over rocks I approached geese flocks undetected through the dense brush. I got very close. It would have been very easy to throw a big stick over a flock to disable a bird. These vast flocks of large birds are a very reliable protein source in winter, and one of the reasons these areas have been frequented by native Americans for thousands of years.The specific area of the sighting is roughly five miles south of the turnoff to San Antonio from I-25. That puts the sighting location squarely within the boundaries of Bosque del Apache Refuge, and roughly two miles from the Rio Grande riverbed.",
