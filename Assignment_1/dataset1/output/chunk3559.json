We were walking on a dirt road.. passing a clearing.  across the clearing about 50 yds, we saw three strange animals.  It was like looking at PaPa bear, MaMa bear and baby bear. From where we were..They seemed to have long necks.  There arms hung down almost to the ground. We stood and looked at them. They looked back at us. My brother and I kept asking each other \"what are they\"?  They turned and walked back into the woods.. we ran home to tell our Mother...She insisted that we saw sheep.  We know they were not sheep.  Later years..when Big Foot  was reported... I know that is what we saw.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness by phone and the following details can be added to the report:--This sighting happened in 1944, long before \"Bigfoot\" was in the press.--The three animals were on two legs, with flat faces and long hair.  They did not have a face like a bear.--The little one was 5 feet; \"Mama\" was 6 feet; and \"Papa\" 7 feet tall.--They had the impression it was a family group based on the three sizes of the animals.--The area then was very remote, and only one other family was in the area.  Margaret's family owned most of the area, including the creek.--Her mother was afraid to stay up there, and they ended up moving after just one summer.--In the 1950s, when the famous \"Bigfoot\" sightings began, Margaret talked to her brother and they both agreed that the description of the bigfoot matched what they had seen in 1944.
