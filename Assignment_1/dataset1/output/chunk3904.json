            "Observed": "This was a girl scout camping trip to what is now the Brendan T. Byrne State Forest. Back then it was called the Lebanon State Forest. This is in the northern region of the New jersey Pine Barrens. We were a scout troop of about 20 girls ages 8-10 and 3 camp counselors. The camp counselors had prepared a huge pot of spaghetti and meat balls for our dinner the first night there. To get to this camp site you drove into the remote area on a one car wide sand road. The sand was very soft and cars would get stuck in the sand. Then you parked when that road ended and hiked through the forest to a lake, I believe it was called Cedar lake. We were to set up a camp site on the bank of the lake. This was in the month of June I believe so it was hot and very dry, clear night, moon shine everywhere after it got dark.",

Their incidents were legendary in South jersey at the time. I do not believe there are any more dairy farms in the area but this was reported over and over again. My father owned 2 blueberry farms near Medford Lakes NJ, so we were in contact with the local farmers and knew what was going on.",

She came to this conclusion based on programs she had viewed on TV.I have done extensive research in the area the encounter occurred in. I have had numerous other reports provided to me over the years from this exact location, that reinforce the possibility that what she and the other scouts and counselors experienced that night over sixty years ago, could have been a legitimate encounter.
