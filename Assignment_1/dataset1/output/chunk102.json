            "Observed": "My teenage sons and I were camping in a dispersed site off of NF-3102 for a few days.  On the morning of the 12th just after 6am I was making coffee when I heard a guttural growling that rose to a higher pitch scream and then became a whooping sound, after which it dropped back down to a growl.  This sequence repeated three times.  My dog freaked out barking, but would not go past the saplings on the east edge of the camp, which is strange because he usually pursues deer, elk, and bears several hundred yards into the woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone: The witness and his sons camped in many states the summer of 2020. They camped at this spot for six days and did not see any other people. On the fourth or fifth morning, the witness was cooking bacon for the first time at that location when the vocalizations started about 150 yards away. Each vocalization started with a four to six second growl that went into scream with five to six whoops. It was about ten seconds between vocalizations. The witness said the branches cracking sounded as huge branch breaks but was constant, as if something was walking around, maybe intentionally stepping on and breaking large downed branches. He did not detect any foul odor. His dog is half Boxer, quarter German Shepherd and quarter Pit Bull and is usually not afraid of any wildlife.  This encounter is about twenty miles straight line on a map from the area of the \"Umatilla Screamer.\" The reader can refer to BFRO report 57323  to read about this and find links regarding the \"Umatilla Screamer.\" ",

We were heading east bound on 36 when we both witnessed in our headlights a shadowy figure sprint across the road from north to south. When I say sprint, I mean like a 100m dash sprinter or faster. It was about 30 yards or so in front of our car with another car coming from the other direction. It was probably 20 yards from the other car. I asked her, \"Did you see that?\" I told her that I saw a figure run across the road and I could see its legs. She responded that she did see a shadowy figure run across the road too, but was not able to notice any more than that. It all happened so fast.",
