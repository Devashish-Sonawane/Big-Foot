            "Observed": "It was the summer of 1993, and I was five years old. I know my age at the time seems discouraging, but I know what I saw, and I can recap the whole thing like it had happened yesterday. It was a late evening and my family and I were playing around in the living room of our single wide. I went down the hallway to the back bedroom. That was my bedroom at the time and my brother and I kept our toys in there. We had one smaller window and beneath that is where we kept our toy chest, and in front of it was a chair. I went into the room, sat on my legs in the chair and opened the toy chest. I grabbed all kinds of legos, and after I had grabbed the last lego that I could have possibly held, I sat up straight and there in the window were two piercing red eyes. I just stared at them. My arms let go of the legos and they dropped back into the chest. I stared at those eyes for minute and than ran down the hallway. I had no idea what it could have been. I yelled over and over again that there was a wolf in my window. But my parents just assured me that it was probably the dog next door.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I conducted an extensive telephone interview with this witness on 7/15/7. I found her to be entirely credible.She reiterated that their residence was a mobile home which was raised on support structures, making her bedroom window well above the height of an animal or even a human who might have been interested in peering into the room. She described \"piercing red eyes\", not at the bottom of the window, but in the middle, making them around 8' from the ground. She expressed that she was entirely captivated for 30-45 seconds, staring into these eyes. She felt no fear of being hurt, and described being frightened, but captivated. She described seeing no facial features, only the piercing, red eyes. She described them as being well apart from one another, and incapable of being the eyes of an owl, or any creature that could have been looking into her window from that height above the ground. ",

We decided to take the Mad Mile extension, since it runs parallel to the lake and is visually quite nice (as well as exhausting).  I was taking photos of mosses, so I was paying attention to the ground quite a bit.  My wife walked ahead a bit, and I was kneeling down to take some more moss photos when I saw this print (attached Word document).  I was very excited, as I had just started reading again about bigfoot, so I took a couple of photos (attached to the document).  The first photo is just a overhead pic, the second photo has my size 12 shoe lined up at the base to show how long the footprint was.  This was the only footprint noted, with good reason--the leaf litter on the trails was extensive.  I did see raccoon tracks, and my wife saw a turkey trot away; later we saw a cottontail scurry off.  This may be nothing, but as there was a sighting of BF some 20 miles away at the Baker Wetlands, I thought this might be interesting.",

The footprint measured approximately sixteen inches long and seven inches wide.   The witness did send me photos of the track, however they did not show enough detail to be included with this report.
