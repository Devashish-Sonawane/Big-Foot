He emphasized how utterly frightening the sound was, mostly by its unearthly human/inhuman quality. He mentioned that if the intial scream, which started at a rabbit-scream pitch, had not been continuously connected to the concluding sound, a gravelly, low chuckle-like \"laugh\" of rough quality, he would not have attributed the two sounds to the same animal. He also mentioned that the vocalization sounded so close, and by implication, powerful, that he was expecting footprints in the snow under the window, but the outside snow was undisturbed within view of the door from which he surveyed the scene.No dogs responded to the sound, including his own, which was nowhere to be seen at the conclusion of the episode.",
