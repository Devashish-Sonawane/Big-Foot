            "Follow-Up Report": "Dr. and Mrs. E., and a middle-aged dentist and his younger wife; the conductor for their section of the train.COMMENTARY and CONJECTURE: The accompanying birds have been mentioned before and no explanation presents itself. The E.s did not suggest that the birds were \"mobbing\" the sasquatch. They thought they were smaller than crows. The \"bellbottom\" effect of the hair on the legs speaks of considerable length, probably 4-6\". The circumstances are again an example of a sasquatch being seen as a consequence of its own curiosity. The area of the Dalles has been the site of repeated sightings over the years and has been conjectured to be an area where sasquatch cross the Columbia by swimming. The Columbia in this area is relatively narrow, but cold, deep, and very rapid. The E.s discussed the sighting in detail with the Bigfoot Research Project and presented their encounter to the Sasquatch Biology class, held at Portland Community College during the next year, and freely answered questions from the audience. It appears that having been confined to the train provided the eyewitnesses with an unusual state of psychological and physical separation and security, which permitted them to assess the creature with calm detachment and objectivity, unsullied by proximity-induced anxiety.",
