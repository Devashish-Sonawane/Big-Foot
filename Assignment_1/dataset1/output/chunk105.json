            "Observed": "I was walking from the house to a detached garage with my daughter about 2:30 am when we both seen a (human like) white furry figure approx. 100 feet from where we were. Our house borders the Huron National Forest the figure was half way down a hill looking in our direction it moved very quickly in a half moon circle and crouched down near a tree. We walked toward the figure I noticed it was still near the tree bent over slightly almost like it was trying not to be noticed. We both ran back to the garage and talked about what we saw and decided we didn't know what it was mostly because of its size and the way it moved. When we got back to the garage we both said how hard our hearts were beating it was truly a scary experience. My daughters name is Madison we talked about it for a long time that night and tried to come up with an animal it could have been but could not. The next day I called my friend Jeff he has experience in this field we walked the area and seen a lot of deer activity and droppings it was thriving with wildlife.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met the witness at his house, his daughter couldn't meet us. The back edge of the property meets up with a towerline, behind the towerline is the Huron National Forest. There is a fifteen foot drop from the towerline to the forest floor, and there is a small clearing where the sighting took place.The witness and his daughter were walking from the house to a garage when something moving very quickly along the towerline caught their attention. They couldn't tell what it was, he described it as a \"blur\". When he looked back to the towerline he could see the head of something standing on the drop off behind the towerline looking at him. The witness and his daughter both saw the head, but couldn't recognize what animal it was and started walking toward it. When they were walking toward it, the animal turned to it's right and disappeared down the drop off. When the witnesses got close enough to see over the edge, they looked in the direction the animal was going and didn't see anything. To the right was a small tree, and next to the tree they saw a figure standing motionless with it's back to them. They both saw it standing there and ran back to the garage.He described the animal as being eight to nine feet tall with white fur and very broad shoulders. It was very muscular with arms that went to it's knees. When they saw the head looking at them, it was too far away to make out any details. ",

It was at a spot were the river bend and neck down real shallow there were huge log jams from the flood we had in spring of 2017 and it was on top of one of the log jams overlooking our tent and canoes.  It jumped off the log jam and ran across the river very fast when it seen me. I did my business and returned to camp I didn't get back in the tent but just stood there and waited for the other 4 guys to get out. I didn't say a word about the incident to the other guys and we stopped about a mile down stream and my friend got out of the canoe first and said \"who in the world has been here with a 14 inch or so bare foot\". I looked at him and walked to look at it and there was a hog sucker fish laying there half eaten.  I looked at him and said it has to be the Bigfoot that I saw that morning and then I told him what I had experienced. There is no access to this spot for miles and only by water.",
