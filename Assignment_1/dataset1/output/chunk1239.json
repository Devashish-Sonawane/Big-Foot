            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness several times by phone.  He was knowledgable about the wilderness and animals in his area, due to his job and care of the outdoors.  After our conversations I believe the witness to be truthful and can add the following details:The witness stated that he was driving @ 40-50-mph when he approached the low water bridge and saw the creature standing on two legs in the water.  He knew immediately that the creature he was observing wasn't a bear.  The witness stated that he attempted  to do a hard stop and the creature turned and looked straight at him, turning the head with a slight chest turn.  The witness says that is when he got the best view of the creature.  He emphasized that he couldn't notice any ears or snout (nothing protruding about the nose area).  The witness also noticed a bulging stomach area but felt the creature was more male in appearance due to no noticeable breasts and because of the muscular build of the creature.  He estimated the height of the creature to be @ 7 ft, due to a tree that grew out over the water where the creature was standing.NOTE: After several people pointed out the witness had mistaken the county in which the siting took place.  After further research and another phone call with the witness the county has been changed.  Witness stated that he knew that it was where several counties ajoined.  He then told me it was on Hwy 181 and this is in( Avery Co.) So I hope this clears up any misunderstanding",

With the time being around 2:00am in the morning, there were no sounds of any traffic or industrial sounds. The weather was excellent; no clouds, not the slightest breeze. My girlfriend and I had turned in for bed at around 1:30-1:45 am. We were talking to each other, just little chit chat when we both heard a far off howl/moan! At that time of night and that there was no wind to disturb the trees and hamper what we heard, it sounded like it came from the south maybe a mile or a mile and a half. The sound started low and kept going up in pitch for about 5 seconds. We both looked at each other and said \"What the hell was that?!\" Now what really freaked us out is that it did it again, only at around 6-7 seconds! It was like, \"Ooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh-----\"",
