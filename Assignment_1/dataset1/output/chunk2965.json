There are slews and backwater holes from them and on both sides of the road was woods. The sun just started to drop but still there was plenty of light. I was in the middle of the small road and I heard something like the woods being knocked down so I stopped and turned to the right and I saw a reddish brown creature run toward me. Before it got to the road it turned on a dime headed toward the river. It was moving incredibly fast. It happened so quick I never got a look at his face but from the shoulders on down. The road was at the least a foot higher than the ground and I was below his shoulder. At the most he was 25 to 30 feet away from me.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness was contacted by phone and we had a discussion about his event from nearly 30 years ago. He remembered it clearly. He was walking down a gravel road near his home at about 8:15-8:30 pm headed for a good and regular fishing hole. At this time in June it doesn't get dark until after 9 pm or so, and there was plenty of light left. He had stopped briefly in the middle of the road, deciding which hole to try first, then started walking again. He heard a sound and off to his right was this \"reddish brown creature\" heading in his direction. It was heading \"at an angle\" so he got a good side view but no facial or other features. The creature got as close as \"25 or 30 feet\" before turning away at the last minute. He said \"it was a massive creature and the arms were swinging fully extended to the front and then back as it ran\". He also told me the arms were \"hung below the knees\"We discussed whether the creature was running at him to try to scare him or if it was just running through the woods maybe chasing prey and happened to see him at the last second. Neither of those possible scenarios made sense to him at the very moment it happened, but after thinking about it either scenario was a possibility. He saw no prey that he recalled, and his gut sense was that the creature was just \"running through the woods and saw a human at the last second\" and changed directions. Just a random strange interaction. We discussed the height of the road at being \"at least a foot (or more) above the forest floor and he was still below the shoulder of the creature. 7-8 feet in height was a good estimate. \"It was no less than 7 ft. tall & probably a good bit more.\"He stood there in shock for a few moments trying to understand what just happened, then decided to \"head back home and not press my luck\".The witness was aware of Sasquatch prior to the event but had never sought out information. He is a very grounded individual and is acutely aware of all known wildlife. ",
