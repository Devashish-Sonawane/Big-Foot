It was walking with the traffic, on the bank alongside FL Turnpike 429.  The gait seemed odd to him, even after considering the uneven slope. He described the build as square and wide.  He thought he was looking at a person with a dark complexion and brown hooded clothing covering every visible body part.  This would be very difficult for any normal person to stand considering Florida heat.  I found this report especially interesting since I have looked at these areas near Florida's major highways and often considered that they may be ideal for such creatures to travel along, offering shelter and food.  They are full of water, swamp-land, vegetation, wildlife and no humans - except for those driving by at normally high rates of speed.  The area is close to populated areas, but with Florida's rapid growth and development, travel routes may necessarily change.This is a Class B siting since the witness is not sure what he saw.  He is hoping that maybe other motorists will come forward with similar sitings in this area.",
