            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, LB concerning his experience while on night maneuvers at Fort Jackson, SC and found his story to be credible.  His experience concurs with other related sightings in the Fort Jackson area of Lexington County, SC.  A number of incidents have been reported from troops stationed at the base over the years.Ft Jackson is in the Sandhills region of South Carolina. It is best described as rolling sandhills with a maze of sandy fire lanes, with pine forests with many small streams that feed into swampy and dense wooded areas nearby.  The fort covers over 52,000 acres and has over 53 ranges located in its area.  This area abounds with wildlife including deer, wild turkey, bobcat, and many species of fish.  The general population is not allowed in these areas and when military maneuvers are not going on, the area would be an undisturbed sanctuary for any large animals to reside undetected.There have been many sightings in this general area of SC -- Lexington and Kershaw Counties.  \"Lizard Man\" sightings happened less than an hour from this area.  The sightings of the \"Lizard Man\"  actually describe a bigfoot and not a lizard-man. One witness saw a bigfoot emerging from an algae-filled swamp. He described it as being wet, slimey and green (covered with algae).  He did not say it looked like a lizard. He said it looked like a bigfoot, but others who heard the description second-hand or third-hand twisted the description into a green, slimey, lizard-like figure. That's how the term \"Lizard Man\" came about.",
