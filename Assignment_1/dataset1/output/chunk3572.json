            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this particular witness in person at his office in the Tribal Headquarters of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation located in New Town, North Dakota.  The witness described hearing of the sighting the day after it occurred.  The following day, he then visited the location of the sighting, (Highway 22 - south of Mandaree, ND), and saw a line of large footprints in the snow, running parallel to the highway approximately one quarter of a mile.  The number of tracks in this line, approximated at a stride of 5-6 feet, would be over 200.  He then took photos of the line of tracks, which he allowed me to view.  Unfortunately, the witness photographed the tracks two days after they had been made.  The weather had been warm and significant melting of the snow had occurred.  These conditions eroded the quality of detail in the photos and only large, round impressions in the snow were visible.  It was apparent that they were in fact a line of tracks in the snow, but both the thawing conditions and the view angle of the photos did not allow any further conclusions.  The witness would not release the photos for further analysis, believing there was some financial gain to be had with these type of photos in his possession.  It can be noted, however, that this line of tracks photographed along Highway 22 does in fact corroborate the description of events found in the \"North Dakota flap\", which can be viewed on report #8165.",
