About mid day we heard something BIG in the woods near where we were fishing, way bigger than a deer running through the woods, in fact it was like a large crashing sound and about 30 seconds later there came the sound of a tree breaking. I suppose it's quite possible that an old rotten tree was in the process of falling down, and it didn't really scare us although it was odd. What happened for the next few hours was however beyond odd, it was downright spooky.",

There is a road that goes towards the lake, but is closed most of the year.  When the road is open, the lake is visited more often by fishermen and hikers.",
