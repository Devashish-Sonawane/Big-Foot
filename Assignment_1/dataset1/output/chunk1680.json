But I had to so I drove out to my site and that is where I saw him on E 1020 N as big as life itself. I saw him for about a minute or two, it was at least 9' 6\" tall and 60\" wide, he had two fingers missing from one hand because he kinda turned and shielded his eyes for a moment then ran off as he did. To this very day I have not been back there since.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Artist and Investigator Sybilla Irwin worked with the witness and provided the following sketches:I spoke with the witness by phone. In Summary:The witness, a former Marine was going out fishing around midnight, there was a bright moon (80% full on this date and was setting around 2 a.m). Witness told me that it was so bright that he could see the corn stalks along the road very well. The location was at the end of a dead-end road alongside a seldom used railroad track and about a mile from the Wabash River. When he turned a small corner with his vehicle he was within 20 feet of a huge upright animal in the roadway. It held its hands up to shield its eyes from the bright headlights and stood making eye contact with the witness. The animal snarled and showed its teeth. After about a minute the animal turned, took a couple of steps and was gone into a deep thicket.I did ask the witness about the missing fingers and how he was able to pick up this detail. The witness stated that because the animal was only 20 feet in front of his car it was shielding the bright lights with its hand and he could see very clearly the missing fingers.  - The witness estimated the animal's height at 9 and 1/2 feet.  - The animal's weight as over 350 lbs.- The animal was very muscular with broad shoulders.- The hair was dark brownish-black and appeared straggly. - He was able to see the face very clearly.- The witness stated he could not see any whites of the eyes.- The animal had an immense jaw.- The teeth resembled a normal human's except very large- The lower lip was slightly drooping- The nose was wide and flat.

It kind of stays with you.  I tried to draw it as close to what I saw as I could. It was so quick that I could not do any justice to detail. It's close.  It turned to it's right and bolted into the corn.  But there is one thing I need to say.After seeing that one animal in 1999 I got a very strong feeling that they are not what you think they are. I hope you and the team can get proof before I pass on. I would love to be vindicated.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I found the witness to be of very good character and has given an honest account of the encounter.The following photographs were taken by Kevin Henderson.This is the wooded area where the animal went towards after it was seen.
