            "Observed": "Hello my name is XXXXXXXX in the year of 2006 I was employed as a Forest Ranger patrolling the West End of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation I was sitting by the side of the road, right before the start of the airport.  I was waiting for woodcutters to return,so I can check their permits.  At this time it was about sundown but it was still light enough to see, I noticed a creature which resembled a man but was covered in black hair, but unlike the BigFoot reports this creature was about average height and I estimated the weight to be about 200 lbs.  I thought I was seeing things, the creature crossed from the northeast and headed west above the cibecue school. It crossed so fast by the time it crossed the road I was stunned and I drove toward the direction the creature crossed hoping to get a better look but it had already crossed into a gully.  I was afraid no one would believe me so I kept it to myself.  I don't know if what I saw was a juvenile BigFoot but whatever it was it seemed to disappear and the creature didn't seem to know I was there since it crossed about 100 yards in front of me, I was backed up off the road.  It was scary and I didn't want to get off my unit and investigate or look for tracks.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On 2/28/08 I spoke with this witness about this incident.He was born and raised in this area and at the time was employed as a forest ranger.  Prior to that he was a police officer.  With both jobs he spent nearly two years patrolling the region.  During this time and over the years growing up there he heard many stories of the hairy men.  As he said in his description of the incident he was stunned to actually see one.He estimated the height of the biped at about 5' 6\" and feels very good about that estimate considering he has seen many people out in the wilderness and is confident about judging size and distance.As he watched it quicky cross the road he felt it either did not see him or didn't care that he was there.  It just moved along like it had somewhere to go. ",
