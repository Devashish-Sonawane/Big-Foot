As I recall there was about 4 inches of old snow on the ground, and as it was very cold that evening the snow was ice incrusted, and made a good deal of noise when stepped on. I was jogging on a trail that is approx. one quarter of a mile long. The trail itself was fairly clear (about two feet wide) and ran across the base of one of the hills that surrounds the Chemung Valley. The surronding area was heavily forested with a mix of trees common to upstate New York.",

The trail itself was approx. one quarter of a mile long, fairly clear (about two feet wide), and surronded by woods on both sides. The trail itself (as well as the hill) is located in the outskirts of the city proper (actually the Town of Elmira vs. City of Elmira). As it was very cold that evening, the snow was ice crusted and it was very easy to discern footsteps in the woods. There are a number of trails that diverge from this one that lead up and over the hill (the hill is probalbly 150-200 feet tall, with a gentle slope).",
