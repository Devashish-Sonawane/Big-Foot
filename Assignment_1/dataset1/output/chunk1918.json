I put on my brakes to get a better view and that's when I saw what it was. It was about 7 to 8 feet tall. Dark hairy color and was standing on 2 legs. It stood and stared at me a few seconds and then turned and walked back into the woods. It took 2 strides and it was gone. I was freaked out!!!! I knew when I saw it, that it was a sasquatch. I came home and told my husband what I had saw and he could clearly tell that I was shaken up.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This seems like a very clear and close daylight sighting. I just got off the phone with the witness, she was still shaken up and its been two weeks. She was driving east on Hwy. 9 towards the Georgia state line after picking up her sick child early from volleyball practice at school. As she was driving, a cow pasture on one side and steep, thick, mountainous drop offs on the other, she approached a very small, clear patch in the thick woods along the road when she noticed something just standing on the edge of the road. She quickly realized what she was seeing was definitely a sasquatch. The witness stated that it was staring at the cows in the pasture on the other side of the road. The witness actually came to a stop in the road while it was still staring at the cows, the witness stated the distance between the sasquatch and her was approx. 30-40 yards - max. It finally turned and look at the witness for approx.. 20+ seconds before taking 2 long strides out of sight. The witness stated she was so awe struck she could not speak , even to tell her child to raise up and look. I asked about how tall it was and what she used to estimate its height. The witness told me her brother is 6' 6\" tall and her father is 6' 8\" tall, she stated she knows tall when she sees it.. and the sasquatch was possibly one foot taller than her father. It had broad shoulders, at least 3, closer to 4 feet wide. Its arms hung down to mid thigh level, it had very dark, closer to black, hair. Its head size was proportionate to the body size with the hair hanging down on the shoulders.  The witness went home, got her husband and returned to the sighting area. She stated her husband knew something had definitely, really upset her. They found the area where it ran into the woods, large patches of grass had been pushed down in a stepping manner.  I just talked to the witness again and she confirmed it was a bright clear day. ",

For this reason we jogged maybe half the trip which got us there in time for saturday night live.  We stayed long enough for me to watch SNL with one girl and my friend to spend some private time with his beau.  It got to be late and we knew we had a long trip back to his place.",
