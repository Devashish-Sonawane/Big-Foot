            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness who recounted his experience as described in the report.  The witness saw the animal from about 150 feet as it was walking into the lake.  His view was from the animal\u0092s left side.  The witness described it as having long hair and described the hair color as being \u0093dark\u0094 as he couldn\u0092t discern the animal\u0092s hair color.  The witness estimated the creature\u0092s height as being about 7 to 8 feet tall.The witness could clearly see the St. Bernard\u0092s head being carried in the creature\u0092s left hand.  The St. Bernard\u0092s head was being carried by the hair on top of its head, snout forward, and flesh could be seen hanging from the dog\u0092s neck.The witness later spoke with the owner of the St. Bernard to inquire about why the dog hadn\u0092t been seen in awhile.  The owner of the dog said that the dog had died a couple of days previous and had been buried back in the woods behind his property.  It is hypothesized that the buried St. Bernard was located by the creature, dug up, and head removed.The witness has suggested digging up the remains of the St. Bernard in order to confirm what he thinks he saw that night.  Current forensic studies suggest that after 15 years, there would be very little left of the St. Bernard due to the natural process of decay as well as the scavenging of animals.The witness, who is very credible, has presented a case that offers the possibility of what appears to be very interesting sasquatch behavior.Editor's note (MM):  This location is near a power line route.  Sightings and related incidents often occur within a short distance of power line routes. This is true in both eastern and western states. Deer and elk often move and feed under power line routes.  The trees and tall brush are cut away in these swaths, allowing berry bushes and grasses to flourish there. There is almost always a gravelled access road under power lines, but very little vehicle traffic throughout the year.",
