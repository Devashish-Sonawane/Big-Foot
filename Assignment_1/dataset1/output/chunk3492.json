            "Follow-Up Report": "I arrived at the base camp right after the event and spoke to the witness. At the time of the sighting, the other expedition members were out of sight, further down the trail. The other members reported that they did not pass anyone along the trail. The two figures were viewed in the mid-afternoon from about 200 yards away. When the witness reached the riverside and looked again, they were gone. The only way to avoid being seen would have been to scramble up the steep hillside on the left or dive into the freezing river and swim away underwater. The witness stated that there wasn't likely enough time for the bipeds to turn the opposite direction and go back behind the bend on the trail. The witness' estimate of height  came from observing other members of the group in the same spot on the trail. She emphasized that people looked very short and round compared to the figures she saw. She described seeing \"more space between the arms and legs\" on the figures.No tracks could be seen on the trail as it is hard packed gravel. A couple of days later in the early morning, I was walking the trail with another expedition member when he spotted a freshly broken mountain laurel limb about twenty feet up the steep slope near where the bipeds were spotted. The limb was about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. The slope was too treacherous for us to climb because of the loose shale and the steep grade.  We discussed the fact that the limb was too thick for a small animal to break and it was unlikely that an animal such as a deer or bear would be able to make its way in that direction. There were no signs of something falling and breaking the limb.This mountainous part of Pocahontas County has a history of sightings. Some of the residents we talked to reported strange howls near the river at night. One expedition member also spoke to a local who said she would not return to the area where we were camped because her family had had rocks thrown at their tent at night, but there was no one else camping in the area.
