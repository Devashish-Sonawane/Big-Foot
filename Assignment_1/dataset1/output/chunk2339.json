            "Observed": "I was archery deer hunting in September 1993, when I had a visual encounter with this creature.  Around 7:00 a.m., I was slowly stalking down a hiking trail in a heavily wooded area when I began to feel extremely uneasy and almost unnerved.  I had the intense feeling that I was being watched and/or followed.  There were no other people in the area other than my hunting companions and they were not in this general vicinity.  I kept moving along the trail literally one step at a time, all the while anxiously looking around for the source of my uneasiness.  After about 25 minutes, I was standing on the trail just looking behind me when I saw this creature walking rapidly down the same trail towards me.  I watched it walk closer and closer for about 6 - 8 seconds (it seemed like minutes) then when we were about 70 - 80 yards apart, it turned 90 degrees from the trail and disappeared over a ridge.  I followed it to the top of the ridge to try and get another look at it, but when I heard a sound that can only be described as a cross between a grunt and throat clearing, I decided I had enough and left the area.",
