The section of our street runs along a ridge, which is bordered by a ravine on the right side. This is a populated area, a small city neighborhood. Behind our house the backyard slopes down about 40 yards until the tree line of the edge of the ravine. This specific area is like a finger of a larger ravine which can be seen on the aerial view on Map Quest for our address. Directly behind our house, just below the edge of the ravine there is a spring that forms a small stream/creek. The trees in this ravine look older, and decaying with many fallen ones. Concerning wildlife there is a fair sized deer herd for the area. We have counted thirteen deer right in our backyard at one time. We have also seen coons, ground hogs, squirrels, turkeys, and plenty of birds. The deer trails are clearly visible.",
