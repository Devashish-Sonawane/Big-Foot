            "Observed": "One night around 11:30-12:00 me and my boyfriend and his cousin were out in a pasture at my boyfriends grandpas land just sitting around talking and his cousin looked over and saw a very large figure was walking toward us. She told us to look and it was over 7 feet tall because my boy friend is 6'5 it had long arms and very bulkey. it stood there looking at us and as we stood up it crouched down.I ran to my car and his cousin jumped in the back seat and I climbed over the passenger seat into the drivers seat and turned on the lights and it was gone by the time I had turned on the light so my boyfriend got into the car and we left and never went back at night.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness and she wasn't really able to add any more specific details to the sighting. The sighting was short with the only descriptive details being over 7ft. tall, long arms and bulky. The creature crouched down as the three witnesses got up to go into the vehicle. It was a clear night and visibility was good, they could tell it was not a person. When the headlights were turned on, it was nowhere in sight. They left the area immediately. No other incidents have occurred there, and the witness has moved from that area since.I was able to talk to the husband that was her boyfriend with her at the time, and he basically related the same story. He did add that the bigfoot creature was by a large hole that a piece of equipment had dug. He believes it came out of the hole and had been watching them. There was a full moon out. He did not see any facial features or any eye shine from the creature. The husband did say that it was huge, and at least 6'5\" regarding height because it stood upright. The creature then crouched down and when they got into the vehicle to shine the headlights on it, it was gone. The sighting lasted about three to five seconds.",

I glanced over while driving at the top of a fenced-in cow pasture and I saw it.  It appeared tall over 7 foot and had long arms walking upright.  It had long hair all over that appeared all over the body and the hair must have been 6 plus inches.  It walked down a powerline clearing and veered off into the woods .  I was kind of in disbelief and told my family what I think I saw, turned around and it was gone into the woods.  I'm 38 years-old and first time I've seen anything like it.  This I saw about two weeks ago and only told family.",
