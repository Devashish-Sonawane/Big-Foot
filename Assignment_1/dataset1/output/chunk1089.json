The event happened after dark at 7pm in the evening.   Late winter - early spring season.   It had been a cold spell.The cabin where they lived was quite remote and only reachable by foot.  They would park their car at the end of a dirt road and hike or wagon cart in their supplies. Both dogs were guard type dogs and normally would alert the owners as to anything unknown approaching, including bear.  This time they cowered under the porch and were  'terrified'.  Both witnesses heard whatever it was crashing through the alder forest on the property.  Finding numerous fresh tree snaps [alder] the next morning at 4' - 5' level along a pathway of flattened vegetation.   The overall experience was one she and her husband vividly remember and although no sighting took place, something definitely big did blast through their property that evening.",
