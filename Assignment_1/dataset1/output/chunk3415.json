While crossing a blown-out beaver dam, we observed 3 sets of very fresh tracks in mud.  Largest were 15-16 inches in length, while the 2 smaller sets were 8-10 inches. The mud was newly exposed, quite soft, and would have filled in quickly if tracks were more than a few hours old.  This is a very isolated area, the nearest year-round maintained road is 10 miles away, and it is a gravell road.  The tracks were very defined, and had very long strides(4+ feet for the larger tracks).  The surroundng area was a series of steep rock ridges and hills, with a small stream, heavily dammed by beavers, winding thru.  You could see where the tracks left the mud and climed the hill, and it was in an area that would be extremely difficult to walk due to steepness, and loose rock.",
