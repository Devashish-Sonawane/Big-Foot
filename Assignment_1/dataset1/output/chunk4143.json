            "Observed.1  ": "efforts of law officers - and left no traces. By now, reports of a mysterious creature of 10-feet height and human-like facial characteristics, was implanted in the records for a second week. And stalking the monster had become a social pastime for twilight hours. One officer said two men identified as Ernest Palmeira, 34, of 717 W. Sixth, and James F. Mihalko, 36, of 3051 Kips Korner, Norco, became angry when an officer, taking the initial sighting report, failed to treat their story as a true one. They came to the police station yesterday to complain and get their report on record. Another officer said he questioned the pair very closely and \"they told a most convincing story.\" The officer, a veteran of the department, appeared a little shook as he talked about it. He had just returned from a search that failed to turn up the monster. The two men told police they drove to the south end of Main Street about 2:30 a.m. Saturday in an effort to see the monster. They drove to about 300 feet north of the south terminus of Main, parked their car and turned out the lights. Exiting from their vehicle, they then turned on the spot light to survey the area. The light revealed the animal sitting on a concrete wall \"slumped over.\" The men told officers they were about 200 feet from the monster and could hear him breathing heavily. They said the animal looked up at them for a few seconds, then disappeared into the brush that surrounds the area. He had a hairy face, stood about 10 feet tall, and moved extremely fast. The men said the animal turned his body when he looked around as if he had difficulty turning his head. About 10:30 Friday night, Ronald J. Campbell, 31, of 2342 (? not clear) S. Gilbert, called police when he heard something outside. He said his dogs began barking wildly toward the rear of his residence, and when he investigated he thought he heard a noise in his barn. The dogs then ran barking into the orange grove that surrounds the house.  Campbell saw nothing, and a search by police failed to locate anything that would have set the dogs to barking.",

            "Observed.1  ": "Whichever explanation one believes, there's no question Lizard-mania has seized this rural community this summer.  It all started when 17-year-old Christopher Davis told police he had been attacked by a creature while changing a tire in nearby Scape Ore Swamp about 2 a.m. one morning back in June.  The creature, he said, was more than 7 feet tall, was black-green and grabbed the door of his car, running as fast as 35 mph as he fled.  Davis said he swerved along the road before the creature, which had jumped on his car, was thrown off.  \"It was strong and it wasn't an animal and it wasn't no man,\" he told Sheriff Liston Truesdale.  As word of the sighting spread, hundreds of outsiders came to walk through the swamp west of town.  A Columbia radio station offered a $1 million reward and reporters descended on the quiet farming community of about 3,500.  Sheriff's department spokesman Billy Moore said he has no doubt there was something on the road with Davis that night.  \"I believe he saw something.  What it was I have no earthly idea.  But it wasn't no Lizard Man,\" he said.  It may have been a bear, Moore suggested.  Or, he said, it could have been people stopping by an artesian well in the area.  He said locals are known to frequent the well at all hours of the day and night.  Scape Ore Swamp got its name in Revolutionary War days.  It was near a British encampment and, when the Americans moved against the area, the British camp followers escaped into the swamp.  What became known as Escaped Whore Swamp became shortened over time to Scape Ore, Moore said.  Since the sighting, however, the sheriff's department has recieved dozens of calls from townspeople when their dogs bark at night or their farm animals act strangely.  \"I think most of the people think it's a prankster or a joke,\" Moore said.  Authorities say there have been hoaxes as Lizardmania spread.  Deputies made plaster casts of large tracks purportedly made by the creature.  Moore said wildlife biologists determined the tracks were man-made.  Last week, an unidentified man reported shooting the thing along Interstate 20, and gave authorities some scales and blood that purportedly came from the creature.  The blood and scales, headed for a state crime lab analysis, apparently are from a dead fish, the sheriff said.  \"It doesn't take an expert to see what they are.\"  Visitors have been pulling off Interstate 20 for the past few weeks to satisfy their curiosity about the Lizard Man.  Marina Watson of the local Chamber of Commerce said business has been brisk this summber, but she had no extimate of how much money Lizardmania has put into the local economy.  If it's Lizard Man paraphernalia you're after, there are hats, T-shirts, inflatable toy dinosaurs and even wanted posters with an artist's impression of the Lizard Man.  Truesdale has had enough.  He said that when stories like the Lizard Man circulate, \" a lot of people try to get publicity and feel important.  We have enough to do without trackind down things like this.\"  Sitting on a counter in the sheriff's department is a can labeled as a Liz-A-Rid repellent-a can that appears to have nothing in it. ",
