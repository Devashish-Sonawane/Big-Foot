            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to this witness for over an hour and a half on the phone. He was entirely lucid, frank, and exact in his descriptions and recollections of events. He invited me to his property for an on-site investigation. I went to the witness' location, located 200 miles or so from my home in Kansas City. The witness purchased the property from his brother-in-law as a place for his upcoming retirement. The home was occupied by the brother-in-law's family while they built their new home next door to this home about a quarter mile away. The home had been vacant for about 2-3 years after his brother-in-law moved. Witness describes numerous events after moving in, objects thrown at the house, screams and howls, footsteps and other sounds of movement at or near the home, etc.  I observed the location under the home where he had the sighting of a lower leg. He also showed me, in the home, where he was standing when he heard something yell just outside his large window, which is on the south side of the home. He heard the scream, went to the window to see what it was, and when he came into view he heard something take off. It covered 20 yards in no more than 3-4 steps, and disappeared into the woods behind his home.The stick structures were marginal. There had been some storm damage, trees uprooted and then dropped back down.  I found a couple of woven structures that could not have happened naturally, but because of the damage and lack of clarity I will not be elaborating on them in this report. The witness had mixed feelings about the activity. Part of him wants the creatures gone because he is unsure of their motives. He has felt threatened by the activity, and was concerned that he would be attacked or harmed in the effort to run him off.  I suggested to him that he needs to reclaim the property, and by just being there on a regular basis should do it. I also suggested that he purchase outdoor motion lights, which he did and thanked me.",
