It happened in September of 2001 on the county line between Walker and Montgomery Counties in East Central Texas.  At the time I was living in the college community of College Station Texas and would commute the hour and a half from home to my work in Conroe.  Due to the drive and the time I needed to be at work I often left long before the sun was rising.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Some of the details that W. C. gave me included notes about the creature's head, neck, shoulders, forearms, hair length, skin color, locomotion and stance. He mentioned that the creature did not stand like a man, and he felt there was no way it was a human, and it didn't look like known apes, but he felt that \"Yes, it was like a primate.\"  He also said it was apelike but different.Its head was large but did not have a full round skull like a human (which he noticed when it walked away and was near his truck).  It looked square but different on top.  He came away with the impression that it had a flat nose.  He didn't know for sure, since his view was limited by light, but he just felt that way for some reason.The odor was terrifically overwhelming - musky like a skunk but worse, and no way could it be from sweat or feces.  It was very overpowering.He thought it had hair, not fur, and it was long in places.  He described it being like a Mohawk on the shoulder leading down along the arm where, when it walked away, it waved in the wind.Its color seemed reddish brown when he saw it walk away and it caught the lights from the truck.  He also caught the dark skin color on what he decided later must have been the palm of its hand as it walked by the truck.He thought it was going to turn his truck over - it was certainly big enough to (he had a smaller type truck).  When it walked it did not jiggle - it looked really muscular and just lumbered, looking as though it wasn't walking fast but covered lots of ground in just a few steps.Asked if he could describe the creature's body type, he stated heavy.  \"It was one and a half of me\" wide and \"probably seven feet tall.\"   A conservative guess at the weight would be over 500 pounds.  He used to play football and at his old alma mater he worked with numerous football players who went on into the NFL, so he has a history of working with large people.It was built like a rectangle, with nothing feminine about it.  He saw nothing but muscle in the heavy chest, and the muscles from its shoulders to neck (trapezoids) were huge.  He felt that it had a neck but couldn't turn easily, and it walked hunched over.  It looked like he had a hump on its back when it walked away.  The reason : Picture walking with your shoulders hunched up to the back of your head and you walking in a slightly bent posture.  With this creature, that  was emphasized even more since it  was hunched over and exhibited extreme muscular development and density..The upper and lower arms were uniform in size and the forearms were like the size of a big Folgers Coffee can.  He told me he couldn't get over the size of the forearms.  When it left he said the arms didn't hang like a person's did - they  drooped off the shoulders and were held bent.  His estimated observation time was between as little as five to ten seconds.He also mentioned that he shook for two days after this event, and he has since given up deer hunting.",

            "Observed": "On December 2014 I was out hunting with my nephew in Big Cypress National Park. We entered the hunting area into Monroe station, we walked the trail that day and there's an open field pass on the trail to the right. We cut through the open field it was a very nice day but we didn't see any game. We were there till 6 pm between 6 pm and 615' we were heading out through the middle of the field towards Tamiami trail to cut through the woods onto the trail. It was still good light out, just before we entered the woods my nephew decides to go across the other woods to see the other side of the field while I wait for him. I was out in the open, I was away from the tree line about 60 yards. I noticed a movement from the distance when I look it was walking big steps right where we had hiked, from what it seemed like it was following us in the distance. I was really scared, I started shouting for my nephew. But wouldn't get my eye off of it. It stood behind a tree moving its head gently side too side looking at me. I was gonna point at it with my rifle too see it through my scope but I didn't because at the same time I thought what if its a ranger on a ghille suit? I didn't want to point at him with my rifle. My nephew came running when he got to me he told me did you see that in the woods. I told him no, look at where I'm looking and tell me my eyes aren't playing tricks on me. He looked, and looked at me, cocked his gun and we ran into the woods to cross over to the trail. By the time we got to the trail running it was night fall. Luckily there was a man in a buggy with his wife. And gave us a ride out...what I saw was approximately 4 street blocks away. Its head was kinda square, its arms would hang down about where I thought its knees would be.",

After that I asked have you all seen something like that. He responded make sure your never caught alone in there at night.",
