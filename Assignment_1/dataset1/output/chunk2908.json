            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness has been a summer resident of Charlevoix for approximately ten years.  This is the first year in which she has experienced the odor and sound that she described.The sound was heard the evening of June 16th, 2008 and appeared to originate from the forest behind the dwelling of the witness.  The sound was heard from within the residence and was audible above the sound of the television.The odor was again encountered on the morning of June 23, 2008 but seemed to be localized near a large conifer on the premises rather than throughout the property as in the first occurrence.The witness cannot stress enough how powerful and overwhelming the first occurrence of the odor was.After having spoken with the witness, I find the witness to be truthful, cooperative, and credible.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After an extensive conversation with the witness, his encounter can be summarized as follows:-His encounter occurred on Reliance Road, as he traveled east toward Front Royal, at a point about 1 1/2 miles before the road's end at Route 522.-The time was approximately 5:30 a.m., about 45 minutes after dawn break, and less than an hour before sunrise. The witness was driving about 30 miles per hour and his head lights illuminated the creature.-When it stepped out in front of his vehicle it was moving quickly, and crossed the road in just two steps. At his closest approach, the creature was within 15 to 20 feet of the front of his vehicle.-It stood erect, not slouched forward, and was swinging its arms as it walked. It did not turn to look at the witness or his vehicle.-The creature was covered all over in hair, dark brown to black in appearance and no facial features could be seen. It was broad through the chest and the witness observed that it \"was very tall\", estimating its height at 8 feet.-It crossed the road from an open field on the left, and disappeared into a stand of woods on the right (south side) of the road. The witness stopped his vehicle to further observe the creature, but it was out of sight into the woods.This area of Virginia does not have a large number of sightings, but the expansive countryside and relatively low density housing provides ample space for a sasquatch to move through and take advantage of the abundant local resources.",
