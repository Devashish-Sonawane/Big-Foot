I screamed for my wife and told her I believe I just heard a squatch, she rolled her eyes and said if you would stop trying to call them after you watch the show they wouldn't come and then 4 more loud knocks. She went back into the house and while I stood there I could here the trees moving around, I have been watching the show and joking with the kids and wife with calling them in the rear of our wooded lot but after hearing this I can honestly say they are out there. This couldn't have been 100ft away from me and was so loud that it felt like it was next to me, I don't know if it was the light music playing that had it let me hear it or the practice calling in the rear yard but there are definitly BIG FOOTS IN DELAWARE",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Visited on-site with witness 12/1.  He was visibly shaken by what he encountered as he retold the series of events.  He appeared genuine and sincere.  Between the initial report and my subsequent investigation the witness has experienced a few more interesting things. Witness had a small stack of straw bales (3 bales high with a total of 10-15 bales) that was pulled apart.  Roughly 4 bales were pushed down and away from the stack.  Appeared that whatever did this, was looking for perhaps rodents or insects.  While the bales had been knocked down, they were not damaged or torn apart.  What is compelling about this, is that the bales are not covered and therefore are quite heavy with moisture. The bales had even started sprouting from the moisture.  Several nights the witness and his wife have both reported hearing knocks.During my investigation on-site, I left an audio recorder with the witness.  This was placed out for several nights over the subsequent weeks.  I have since reviewed the recordings and found nothing remarkable. I have found no solid evidence to back up the witnesses' claims, but currently have no reason to doubt what happened to him and his wife.  With numerous historical accounts coming from this region, this only helps reaffirm the likelihood of this being a true Class B encounter.",
