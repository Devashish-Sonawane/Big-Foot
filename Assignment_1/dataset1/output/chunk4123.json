            "Observed.1  ": "According to Gamache's report, the three youths, Tom V. Gerstmar, 17, Earl Thomas, 18, and Jerry Lazzar, 16, were camped at Section Three Lake on Pinegrass Ridge Wednesday. The three were heading back to their camp after bear hunting all day. As they walked they heard noises and had the feeling they were being followed, the report said. They built a fire at their camp and more noises were heard. The report said Gerstmar directed his flashlight across a small pond and spotted two greenish-yellow eyes. Later they again spotted the eyes with their flashlights, only this time found them housed in a human-like furry body eight or nine feet tall, the report said. At that point the youths decided to fire their rifles to frighten the creature. They said the creature moved off a little after seven shots were fired. When their flashlights again found it, it growled and screamed, the report said. And the three decided they would leave their tent and belongings behind and take a ride toward civilization. Gamache, another deputy and Washington Game Department Agent Larry Konen, returned to the camp Thursday and began searching for what the boys said they saw.",

They surmise that the creature made the impression as it sat down to eat the apples. Jeff Meldrum, an anthropologist from Idaho State University who examined the cast, reports that the imprint appears to have been made by a large, hair-covered hominid about 8 feet tall. Meldrum also identified dermal ridges, like human fingerprints, on the heel print. The BFRO has invited scientists and forensic specialists to examine the cast, but so far the group hasn't had any takers.",
