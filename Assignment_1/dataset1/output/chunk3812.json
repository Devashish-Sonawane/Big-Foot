They were gone....no rabbits, no squirrels, no frogs or toads and very few birds. Where did they go....and WHY? We found strange looking droppings with animal hair, but never had the presence of mind to bring any of it home to have it analyzed. We also found strands and gobs of hairin tree branches. My husband caught a large steelhead, and we left the carcass on a stump to see if Bigfoot would take it. It was gone the next weekend, but who's to say a bear or cougar didn't take it?",
