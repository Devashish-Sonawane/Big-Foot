I was driving along on the Prospect/Butte Falls highway. I came around a corner and was slowed down to about 30 mph. As we turned the corner, about 40 yards down the road on the right hand side, I saw what I thought was a man take a step from the road into the forest. I clearly saw an arm swing and a leg. What struck me strange was that he was pitch black from head to toe. I said to my wife, \"What was that?\" She said, \"I don't know.\"",

She mentioned that at first sight - at about 100 feet - she thought it was a person in totally black clothing, inappropriate to the season. Next she realized that the individual was about 8' tall and had a coat of hair that glistened in the sun. At closest approach, she thought that the sasquatch had some similarity to a tree stump in the forest, at least with respect of its degree of camouflage.",
