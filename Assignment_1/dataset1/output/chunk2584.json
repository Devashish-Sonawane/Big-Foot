            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone. The witness believes it was October and does recall many details about the face. She said, \"you never forget something like that.\" She saw the four foot tall skinny figure for about five seconds and it was about ten feet away or less as they passed.  It had about six inch long smooth hair and was standing straight with very skinny legs and arms. It was moving its long arms with hands as she described but she saw the face. It had hair on the face but not covering. It had dark eyes and skin. She said the head was human shape and the facial features were human like. She does not recall a long neck and did not see teeth or ears. It definitely did not have a bear nose, she said.  The witness often observes bear in their backyard where they live. She volunteered in the past at a wildlife rehabilitation for three years in Washington State. I find her very credible.I asked her to look at the Bigfoot Sketch Project on the BFRO homepage to compare faces. What she saw would be a blend of the Omah (with the darker skin), the Windego and Rockies (with longer hair around face.)  ",

I sat down then heard the most eerie scream i have ever heard and i am positive it was not a deer or bobcat. It was almost human like but i could feel the anger in the scream. i was probally 50 yards from the lake with heavy vegitation and trees between the lake and me and the scream came from inside the 50 yards. After the scream i stood up and heard what sounded like huge rocks being thrown into the lake. I got out of that area as quick as i could.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness about what he experienced, and found him able to recount what happened very clearly.  He was on his friend's property and had been bowhunting for deer in the evening hours.  On the property are multiple small lakes and swampy areas.  He was near one of these swampy areas when he heard a loud scream/howl very near him, which lasted about three seconds.  He compared it to the 1978 'whoopcall' found on the BFRO website, and he's never heard anything like it before. On a different occasion, splashes from a lake on the property were heard; when asked if it could have been beaver, he described the splashes as sounding like the distinct 'kerplunk' from rocks or stones being thrown into the water.  In the following November, his friend heard a loud scream and something heavy walking in the forest.  The property where this occurred is about 1000 acres, near Huron National Forest, and it has a heavy deer population. Any updates from this area will be posted in this report. ",
