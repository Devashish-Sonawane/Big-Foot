He claims there are footprints \u0093all around up there,\u0094 and that they show three big toes. Randy describes the \u0093creature\u0094 as being between 8 and 12 feet tall, \u0093kinda white and it moves quick.\u0094 The teenager also claims he has heard the \u0093creature\u0094 several times and says it \u0093lets out a long screech kinda like an old steam engine whistle, only more human.\u0094 He says a friend in Wisconsin has photographs of the footprints. Randy says many of his friends have seen the footprints or the \u0093creature\u0094 but don\u0092t want their names mentioned.
