In the fall of 1970, I was hunting on the east side of the lake [Long Pond] in Baxter State Forest with Danny Wolfe, a vet now in Ohio, a friend from Montana (deceased) and another vet. One morning I hunted alone south of the lake, when I encountered a strange musky smell in the woods along with a foot-long black scat that looked human except for the extraordinary thickness and width. I also observed small scat that looked like a large pile of baby feces with white and yellow texture. As I proceeded on, I was confronted with the sound of thumping like a partridge on steroids drumming. The ground actually shook. The hair on my neck was raised and the pit of my stomach seemed suddenly queasy as the rotten smell got worse. Suddenly, a large dead tree came crashing down about a hundred yards in front of me. This scared the s... out of me, as the woods were deathly quiet, no wind, no birds etc. I returned to camp and was severely guffawed by the two vets, Dr. Heisel and Dr. Wolfe.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The primary witness stated that he initially became nervous over the unusual quiet of the forest, a state of mind that changed to fear with the discovery of the scat, followed by \"terror of the unknown\" with the falling tree and the thrown rock, respectively.The witness commented that he smelled the small scat up close and it had the distinctive aroma of that of a breast-feeding baby. The large scat was about 14\" long, 2\" in diameter and contained visible hairs and seeds. Its black color suggested to them that the animal had intestinal bleeding (possibly from an abundance of hookworms, observed by WHF in a fresh stool sample in Oregon). Conversely, if this encounter was with a female recently postpartum, it might be indicative of her having eaten the placenta, which would blacken the stool. The drumming sounded to the witness exactly like chest beating (known to reach frequencies of 10 beats per second in gorillas) and probable foot stomping, given the perceptible vibration in the soil. He assumed that there had been a male, female and infant, the latter two implied in the report, the male speculated to be present on the basis of the physical feats which would be unlikely to be performed by a female with a baby at the breast.The downed tree was a dead hardwood tree, about 30' high.The rock thrown at the two \"interlopers\" was spinning and traveling rapidly enough that its passage was audible. Its total trajectory was estimated at 50-75 yards and the weight of a head-sized rock about 25-50 lb. Both witnesses were sufficiently unnerved by the event that they never considered taking a stool sample or collecting the thrown rock.The Witness indicated that the \"chest thumping\" was at a frequency of approximately 4 per second and were regular",
