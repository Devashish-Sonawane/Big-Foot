            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and have the following to add to his report:- The encounter happened around noon.  The sky was overcast, with light drizzle that morning.- The encounter lasted for around five seconds.- The animal stood in the hazelnut bushes 60 to 70 feet from the witness.- The animal was about six and a half feet tall.  It had a very large build, like that of a \u0093heavyweight wrestler\".- It was a uniform dark brown to black color.- When he first glanced at it, the animal was facing him.  When he turned to look at it directly, it had turned and then walked upright into the brush and was gone.- It had a rounded head and a very short neck on top of broad, hunched shoulders. It had no muzzle that he could see nor any ears. - He could only see it from the chest up.- It walked upright, with hunched shoulders into the thick brush without making any noise.- The area was all hazelnut brush, bogs and aspens. The witness had seen deer, bear and moose in the area before.- It was distinct from a bear in that it had broad shoulders, no visible ears, no muzzle and it walked upright.- It was distinct from a man in that it was deer opener and it was not wearing blaze orange; it was all one uniform color, including the face; it was broader than most men; and it walked with a distinct hunched posture.- He commented on how frightened he had become during and after the encounter.I found this witness to be very honest and credible.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness and found him to be credible. He added the following details about what they heard that night:- The vocalizations began as an owl type hooting, then turned to chattering like a monkey, then long deep howls, then barking like a dog. There were no dogs that he knows of in the area.- He felt that the owl noises, the chatter, the howls, and the barks were all coming from the same creature or creatures.- He has hunted and fished his entire life and had never heard anything like it. - The vocalizations were not more than 50-60 yards away.- The next day he and his nephew looked up animal sounds online. They found the BFRO site and listened to the audio clips.The deep screams/howls were similar to the \"Ohio Howl\" recording, as far as pitch and length. It sounded like whatever was making the howl had a lot of lung power.- The rocks being thrown into the water sounded large and heavy. - The two of them were growing increasingly uneasy the longer they stayed, and finally decided to leave after the rocks started to hit the water.",
