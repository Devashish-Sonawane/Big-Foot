There were a few times it was like there was something outside scarring them. It happened about 2 times. Both times it happened it was at night. The horses would just start going nuts running all over the place and just freaking out. The horses were used to being around dogs and deer were seen a few times in with the horses and they never messed with them. Whatever was around them those nights they did not like it and they were scared of it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, who was a bit reluctant to speak with me. She actually hung up on me, thinking I was someone calling to make fun of her. After we spoke for a bit she relaxed and recounted the night's events. The cage (kennel), her rabbit was in was being rattled around by \"something\". She felt it was trying to get to the rabbit. It was a kennel for a larger dog, and she had moved the rabbit from its usual pen to this big kennel on the front porch to keep it from the wind. It was very cold and this was actually the first night she had put the rabbit in the kennel, and whatever \"it\" was was slamming the kennel around pretty good. Her two dogs, who usually bark at \"anything\" were dead silent and frozen in place. Her bedroom window is right next to the front door, where the kennel was, and she had a direct sight line to the front of the house. She saw a massive creature just standing in front of the window looking in. She saw the head and shoulders from her bed, which was about 15-20 feet from the window. Her porch is 3 feet off the ground, and the creature had moved off the porch and was standing in front of the window just off the porch. With her porch being 3 feet off the ground and her window was another 3-4 feet high, she & I estimated the height to be 7 ft. plus. She felt like the sighting lasted for at least 30 seconds to a minute.....they just stared at each other. During this entire event, she was trying to awaken her now (ex) husband, and when he finally awoke, the creature took off. He saw nothing. The only ambient light was a single yard light up on a telephone pole, which back lit the creature. Light was about 30 ft up a pole and at least 50-60 feet from the home. The situation with the horses was that they were being kept at her place as a favor. She was familiar with them, had seen them in their normal environment, and they were peaceful, not afraid of dogs or other animals, yet when they got to her place, there was \"something\" that was spooking them. She could not say it was a \"Bigfoot\", or any other animal that was spooking them. Just that being at her place made them very skittish. Soon after this incident, she divorced and moved to Texas.",
