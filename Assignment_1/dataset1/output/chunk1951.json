It was around noon when we arrived and started setting up the tables and preparing the food. My one brother had purchased a moped that was in exellent condition which he kept there for anyone to ride. After about an hour I thought I would take my son for a ride. He was 3 at that time.",

He had just finished cleaning up an area when he began looking around seeing what else would need to be done.  Suddenly there were several large thuds which were of sufficient force to shake the ground so that he could feel them in his feet.  As he started to look up he caught a glimpse of a shadowy, large, upright figure moving very fast through the woods but disappearing just as he managed to focus on it.  He immediately entered the wooded area looking for the figure, but found nothing.  He returned to the clearing where the others were and began relating what he had seen when two deer acting very spooked entered the clearing from the area of the woods he had seen the figure, and stopped upon seeing the humans.  For a few minutes of indecision they kept looking behind them into the woods then at the humans, doing this back and forth several times as if judging which was more dangerous, before bolting off in a new direction.",

Tumbleweeds had been blowing across the road before.  He came up from the south by the Santa Clara River.  We saw him in our headlights.  He was about in the middle of the road when we saw him.  He was swinging his arms like a human and he kept glancing back to see how fast we were apporaching.  He was  8 to 10 feet tall, had a hairy body and looked like the ones I have seen on TV.  His hair was brown in color.  His hair was blowing in the wind, and we did not feel any fear.  The speed limit in this area is 45 MPH.  Ray slowed down to about 25 MPH.  We did not even talk to each other until we got past him.  Then we each said \"what did you just see\"?  We got to see him for a long time because the road was quite wide and it took quite a while before he went of the shoulder and down a small embankment.",
