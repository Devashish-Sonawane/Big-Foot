            "Observed": "Hello guys. I am Michael from Vancouver,British Columbia. About 25 years ago one summer evening, we were driving to Vancouver from Seattle. It was a warm,clear night. no wind. About 10 p.m.,we were a few miles south of Belingham. Now, that part just south of Bellingham on the I5 freeway, is a hilly wooded area for about 5 miles, surrounded by farms on the south and Bellingham on the north. Any way I was driving around a bend when all of a sudden I had to veer the van to avoid running into something running across the freeway going towards my right. I was on the outside lane,and he was almost across. At first I thought it was a large dog,but it was too big. It had short reddish fur, it was running on all fours.Then I thought a bear since it's shoulders were higher",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness, Michael D., lives 30 miles north of Vancouver, BC.   He is a photographer and painter and runs an art gallery.  He was driving north on I-5 home to Vancouver from Seattle on a summer evening around 9:30-10 p.m.  It was  warm summer evening weather around dusk.  He had a passenger in the car who was asleep.  As he passed Lake Sammish northbound, the road curved to the west and drove through a hilly mountainous area that is forested with little population.  Investigator knows of this area personally and can verify.  Just before he passed a painted rock that high school seniors use to paint their graduating years on, the witness had to swerve to avoid a dark animal traveling from left to right across the freeway.  The witness was in the outside lane.  The creature was running on all fours.  At first the witness thought it was a dog but thought it was too large to be one.  Another reason that a dog was ruled out in the witness\u0092s mind is that its back was not horizontal like a dog would be.   The back shoulder area was higher than the rear.  Also, the animal had \u0093shoulders\u0094 that stuck out unlike the way a dog\u0092s just go straight to the ground.  Then he thought it might be a young bear.  The creature was startled and stopped in the road and the witness said it gave him a frightened look.  The headlights on Michael D.'s van were illuminating it's face.  At this point, the witness knew it was not a bear because it had a flat face and no \u0093snout\u0094.  He also described it had big eye sockets \u0093like a gorilla\u0094.    The witness did not recall seeing any ears.  The head had generally a round shape.  The animal had a slim build and was covered with short reddish/copper colored hair.  The witness estimated the height of the animal at around 4 ft when on all fours and around 6-6.5 feet if standing upright.  At no time during the witness\u0092s observation did the animal travel on two legs.  Michael D. has had substantial experience observing bears.  His art gallery/home is located in a rural, wooded area and he sees bears often.Years later the witness mentioned seeing a book called \u0093Bigfoot Sightings in the Northwest\u0094 and read that there had been many sightings west of the Bellingham area in the past.   He went onto the internet, found the BFRO and wanted to report his experience.I also talked to the witness\u0092s mother, a pleasant, friendly older lady.  She mentioned that a lot of people in British Columbia believe in the Sasquatch.",

The sounds were coming fro the cliffs nearby, I think it was to the northeast. there were many caves in the cliffs, but inaccessible without climbign equipment.there aren't really any landmarks out there, since everything looks pretty much the same, but when your coming up to the lake, the trail sort of disappears if u don't know where your going.
