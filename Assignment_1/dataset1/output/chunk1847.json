            "Observed": "My Grandson (11 years old at the time) and I were hunting for deer in the back end of the Clay Bank swamp, this time on the north end of it, opposite of my earlier encounter, when it was getting twilight we decided to call it a day, picked up our equipment and started a slow walk back to my truck, only got about 50 yds when a 6 point buck ran within 20 feet to the front of us, and about 6 feet behind the deer was a sasquatch chasing him, it had its arms outstretched to grab the deer, it was black and in the 8 ft area, really big.  As the creature was directly in front of us it looked at us, it was as surprised as we were, the deer continued on to the south west, the creature headed south east at that point into the pines, hard woods, hemlock and ceders, it was out of sight in about 15 seconds, they seem to be able to hide from sight pretty easy.  My Grandson turned to me and said,\"Holy crap Grandpa did you see that big black thing?\" all I could say was \"yup\",  and again the safety was taken off on my rifle as we walked the rest of the way out.  My Grandson wanted to take a peek and see if we could see it again, but we didn't.  To the east south east of us is a clear cut field which is the direction it headed in, and to the east of us is a jackpine plantation.  I feel the creature only went as far as it needed to be out of our sight, and probably to continue his hunt for venison after we were gone.  We were back in the same spot the next morning at my Grandson's request, he was unafraid when he was with me, and against my better judgement we went back to same spot.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After interviewing these witnesses, it is clear that they had an experience that they will never forget.  Both witnesses came away with a lasting impression, although neither witness is concerned about hunting the same area in the future. The witness and his grandson, who is now 14 years-old, both described seeing a big, dark creature chasing a deer.  Its hands were human-like, but much larger than a human hand and the creature's hands were stretched out before him, reaching for the deer.  Both witnesses describe the creature as about eight feet tall, light black skin on the face, black to brown medium length hair all over its body.  Hair on the shoulders and arms was longer than in other places.  They saw the creature running right behind a deer, the encounter lasting only about 11 seconds.   The creature took about 6 steps then looked at the grandfather and ran the other direction.  He disappeared behind some trees and could no longer be seen.  The grandfather stated that the eyes were dark, with no visible white areas.  When I asked the grandson how he felt about the encounter he said, \"I was creeped out!\"Here is a link to the earlier encounter he referred to:report #30089 ",

I was enjoying the late summer weather by taking a walk when suddenly I heard something stir in the brush several yards ahead of me. I walked silently for a few yards, daring not to get too close. More rustling. It was moving away now.... and then out of nowhere it appeared ahead of me. I don't think I have ever seen any bipedal thing that tall.... and hairy. Of course I wasn't right next to it... with the animal being about 20 yards away. I was twelve at the time, but I know what I saw. Call me crazy, but when I got to where I first heard the rustling, there was this odiferous smell that I can't put into words. The creature was dark brown, almost black, and hairy, like an ape, but bipedal like a human. Its face and muscular structure resembled an ape, but its upright appearance looked more like a human. I followed the animals' route several days later for about 20 yards after it disappeared and found a faint footprint. It was enough to make out the characteristics. Five toes and I would estimate that it was larger than Shaq's foot by a long shot. I walked along the fence line for a while and I couldn't see any holes. There were some parts of the fence though, that the animal could have just stepped over, being that big (8ft approx).",
