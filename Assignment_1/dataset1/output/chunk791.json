            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone:The witness recalls as Mount St. Helens was erupting, he was looking down the highway but his parents were glancing out the side windows. About 200 yards down the highway he saw a very tall, big, brown figure cross the highway in two steps with arms swinging. It was too far away to see facial details and it did not turn its head. He recalls the figure had long hair but not flowing.While only observing the figure for about two seconds, the witness got a good look at it. He said the figure appeared to be moving fast, \"as if getting out of the area.\"When coming to one spot, he and his parents had a good view of Mount St. Helens erupting. Wikipedia describes the eruption of Mt. Saint Helens: \"The eruption was preceded by a two month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes... An earthquake at 8:32:17 am PDT on Sunday, May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly molten, high pressure gas and steam rich rock in the volcano to suddenly explode northwards...\"I find the witness credible.  ",

My wife & i were sleeping & about 2am we both woke up and heard something outside are window. We were living at the time on the backside of Myakka State Park. This area of Myakka State Park is very desolate, very isolated. Besides ur regular wild animals only other thing that would be walking around would be ur Florida marijuana growers in the swamps out here. My wife & i have lived in Florida 30yrs and both are avid outdoors types.  I hung out in these woods in this area for over 20yrs,and thought I had heard everything, my wife also. Well anyway when we woke up and heard something out are widow, we had a very strong odor of something coming thru are window. My wife & i looked at each other with looks on are face ,with wonder, we both said at the same time, what the hell is out there, right as we said that this thing shreeked almost human sounding, but a real wild shreking...I was going to send our lab & pit bull after it but we couldn't get them out of our room,& they had never been scared of anything.Then I went to check on are little girl,she slept thru this. When this thing screemed in our window, to reach the window from outside it would have to be at least 7ft tall. We did not dare go outside, espically since our dogs wanted no part of what ever it was...",
