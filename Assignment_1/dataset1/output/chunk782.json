            "Observed": "As we were coming home from church about 9:30 pm, on  a Wednesday night we were headed down HWY 101.  We were driving slower than usual because it was so dark and there wasn't alot of traffic on the road, making sure we didn't hit any deer.  As we were approaching a curve we spotted movement on the right side of the road.  We slowed more because we thaught it was a deer.  As we got closer it decided to cross the road.  It was so big it seemed to be a bear.  But as we looked closer it was only on 2 legs instead of 4.  It was so tall it seemed to walk hunched over dragging its arms.  Were we seeing things???  We got chills as we passed an old swamp clearing in Paulding Co.  and realized that we had heard tales of Big Foot in this area and after researching what we saw, we know 100% that we saw him.  It was the biggest, widest creature I have ever seen and really didn't seem to be bothered by us and then he just disapeared, like in the blink of an eye.",

The husband, who was driving described slowing down due to there usually being deer crossing the road in this area.  He then described seeing something large kneeling down on the right side of the road.  This is when the animal stood up on two legs and proceeded to cross the road.  The animal was described as being over seven feet tall and weighing at least 400 to 500 pounds.  It was covered in thick hair that was reddish brown in color and 3 to 4 inches long.  The creature was described as having wide shoulders with hands that hung below the knees.  The ears were noted as being \u0093low on the neck.\u0094  The animal crossed the road with considerable ease and fluidity, and was quickly gone.This encounter occurred on Hwy. 101 near Harmony Road.  Quite near this location is Hannah Swamp which has a very long history of bigfoot sightings.",
