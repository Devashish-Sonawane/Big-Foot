            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by telephone and he had the following things to add.  As he started up the hill to hunt ginseng, he heard people knocking in the forest.  At the time, he attributed it to other people chopping woods.  He later thought this was weird because he never saw any other people.  As he was climbing, he heard objects being thrown in the forest; whizzing through the leaves.  Later, he figured that rocks were being thrown at him.  He also had rocks thrown at him as he was exiting.  As he neared the top of the mountain, he encountered rock outcroppings.  He was examining one of these rock overhangs looking for signs of ginseng, when he noticed a large, dark, hairy figure behind him standing across the hollow and up the hill.  The witness was close enough to discern two eyes, a nose, and fingers on its hands.  The Sasquatch was covered in dark brown to reddish hair.  Its face was lightly covered in hair, he could also discern a beard.   As he was taking this in, the Sasquatch eased behind a tree and disappeared from sight.  The witness did not hear it leave and could still feel its presence.  The witness was overcome with a feeling that he shouldn\u0092t really be there.  That is when he felt it necessary to calmly talk to what he saw and quickly leave.  The witness tried not to maintain eye contact out of fear and not knowing what the Sasquatch would do next.  As he went away and back down the ridge, he could hear it following him at a distance making loud crunching steps and breaking sticks as he followed.  The witness stated that some rocks were thrown at him on his way down.  The witness was not followed all the way back to his family, but he felt that he was being watched.   A year later, he returned to the ridge, and found the spot where it had been standing. Using a measuring tape and a tree branch for comparison, he measured the height to be eight foot six inches tall.Report #11966 , the report he referred to.",
