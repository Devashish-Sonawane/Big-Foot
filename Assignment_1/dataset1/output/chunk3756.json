            "Observed": "A boy of 12 years of age was squirrel hunting on his parents property. His parents own over 100 acres of land which has livestock on it. At any rate, the boy, whom I'll call Mike, was sitting just inside the woodline waiting for a chance to get a squirrel. He heard something running towards him off to his right and thought it was a deer. He soon discovered it was a rabbit running through the woods. A moment later he heard some heavy walking and thought it was a person. It wasn't. What Mike saw was described as between 7 and 8 feet tall; was white in color and the skin on its hands and face was black. Mike noted the fact that the fingers on the hands were long and skinny. The creature rested one of its hands on the side of a tree. He didn't see the eyes but that could have been because of bangs hanging over them. He only saw part of the ears. He did see that the head was not rounded like human, but sloped back to a point. He also said it was \"fat\". I finally learned what he meant by fat. It was very bulky from the waist up. Mike saw all of the creature except below the shins. After about 30 seconds the creature noticed Mike. They had a brief stare down and Mike finally gave in by running out of the woods, through an open field and back to the house. As it turns out, Mike was about 35 feet from this creature.",

He called me up to tell me what he saw.  It turns out that on Feb. 6th I was on my way home on the same road in the same location.  It was around 10:20 pm and I was doing about 50 mph.  I saw something run across the road extremely fast.  It was around the same height as the hood of my car and it was black in color.  It ran so fast I didn\u0092t even need to hit the breaks.  Being an avid outdoors man I can usually identify animals, but I was not able to identify this one.  It was defiantly on two legs and covered in black hair.  No bear can run that fast and it defiantly wasn\u0092t a coyote or fox.  I drove home as fast as I could; I was shocked by the encounter and called my friend to tell him.  Everything I explained was what my friend had experienced as well.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness over the phone on the evening of 3/31/2007.The witness rounded the corner and the headlights of his vehicle shined on the animal. This is when the animal started to run, as if surprised and not wanting to be seen.The witness said he had never seen anything like this before. The animal crossed the two-lane road in an upright position on two legs in an estimated 4 to 5 strides. The arms of the animal were swinging as it ran, and were straighter than at a 45-degree angle like a person would run.The witness estimated the animal to be 4' to 5' tall and weighing 150 to 200 pounds. It had black hair estimated to be about 4\" to 5\" long.The overall description of this animal is very close to the figure observed in Report #16604 Update 12/13/2007:The witness sent me the following email.Hey Mike, I was the guy that sent you a sighting report in February of 2007.  It was the one in Warren County.  I was browsing the website and saw the picture on the home page that was taken in North West PA.  The image that really caught my attention was, Image 2 Creature (Jacobs Photos - PA, USA, 9/16/2007).  I just wanted to let you know that this image shows what seems to be almost identical to what I saw that night on my way home. --FrankClick on the link above to read about and see the Jacobs photos.",
