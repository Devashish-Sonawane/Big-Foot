The following details can be added to the report:\u0095  While hiking, the group was followed by the large animal for more than one hour.\u0095  The creature\u0092s upper body was massive.  The witness described it as having a \u0093Mr. Olympia\u0094 build in its shoulders.  The thighs were also commented upon as being very muscular.\u0095  The hair color was reddish brown and matted into dreadlocks in some areas.\u0095  The creature\u0092s gait was smooth and quiet.  It swung its arms in a human-like fashion, but slower.  \u0095  The witness was awakened at approximately 4 a.m. by a low-pitched series of howls.  The howls were of varied lengths, some short and others long and drawn out.\u0095  When gone from camp the next day, the items on the table appeared to have been shuffled around, but nothing was apparently taken from the area.\u0095  The witness has invested a good amount of his own money into equipment to do more research in this and the surrounding areas.

I was just going over the bridge close to the Holiday Recreational Center. Well just over the bridge the road curves slightly then straightens out, I had my high beams on like I always do when I pass a wooded area (I am a strong believer in Bigfoot) to try and catch a glimps of the sasquatch, Well that night it paid off! What I saw was a figure about 8 and a half to 9 feet tall and was hair covered, my light had made his eyes glare and he kinda squinted his eyes a little due to the light I am guessing. And I supposed I surprised it as it appeared to be just making its way walking out of the tree line towards the road and thats were I saw him, he stopped instantly when my light hit him (I saw him instantly, as well I slowed down)he backed up into the tree line more and just watched me in a seemingly very curious manner. at that point I had been stopped and due to the angle of my lights not being directly on him anymore, just the peripheral of my lights were on him, all I could see was from his shoulders up. I was speechless and for some reason I called out saying \"Hi!\" and at that point he backed up out of the light and I could hear running off into the woods. I stayed a few more moments and continued on my way. the entire incident from start to end only lasted about a minute thirty. END REPORT",
