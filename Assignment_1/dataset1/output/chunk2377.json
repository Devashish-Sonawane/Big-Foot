After listening to the sounds you have listed on your site I realized the ones I heard were very similar. I was 15 and my family and I were on a hunting trip in the north Kaibab region of Az. We were there for 4 nights and 5 days. At the end of each day just as the sun was behind the ridge but not quite down we started hearing a high pitched whoop sound. The sound came as a double whoop(whoop,whoop). It was a little higher pitched and shorter. It could be heard from the ridge just west of our campsite about a 1/2 mile or so away. The sound continued for about 2-3 hours or until just after dark. It also sounded as if it was moving around on the ridge and maybe even coming closer as it got louder several times. there was about 30-40 seconds in between each set of whoops.",

There are similar sounds he listened to on this website which prompted him to post this report.  The vocalizations heard on this trip seemed to come from multiple sources in apparent response to each other and on consecutive evenings.  In this report he describes high pitch whoops but he added during our discussion that they were almost \"whistle like\" and as though the sound came from the throat and not a typical whistle like we would do.This area is a popular for deer hunting and he has been there several times over the years. He is also familiar with animal sounds of this region, this was something very different.",
