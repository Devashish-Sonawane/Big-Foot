            "Observed": "I was a frequent visitor to my grandparents since I was born in 1985. When i was 8, on a walk down to the baseball diamond one night, i heard a stirring in the woods. Figuring it to be maybe a hunter (I was ignorant of hunting seasons at the time- so I could not rule that out), I turned around to head towards the woody hillside along the driveway to greet the hunter, or to threaten him off the property (my grandfather allowed certain people to hunt deer when in season) from a safe distance. however, instead of seeing a person with reflective gear, I saw a large, tall shadowy figure with odd eyes- its eyes glowed red, probably from a reflection or something... it slowly backed away though, and headed up the hillside.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking to the witness, the best estimate of distance to the figure was between 30' and 80'. He described the terrain where he saw the figure as being uneven and steep. The witness thought that only a bipedal animal could have stood at that spot for the length of time that it was seen. He also described the figure as \"shifting\", not standing motionless. Before the sighting the witness heard \"low tones\" in the area and could only describe it as sounding like something trying to communicate that couldn't quite speak words. He felt that the sounds he heard were related to the figure he saw. The witness also has heard the same sounds on other occasions while out on his grandparents' property at night. The witness reports he has not noticed similar activity in the area for the past six or seven years and feels that what he saw is no longer in the area.",
