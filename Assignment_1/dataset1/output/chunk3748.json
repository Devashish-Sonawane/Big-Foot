            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted Mr. C regarding his report because even though he did not provide a great deal of information in his initial posting I had a feeling that there was more there.  Furthermore, I grew up around the Kalamazoo area and spent a great deal of time hunting and camping throughout the southwestern part of the lower peninsula.  The possibility of a photographed print was also hard to pass up.The Land area around this sighting is dominated to the east by Lake Michigan and I-196 to the west by Paw Paw Lake and M-140.  The land in between is surprisingly wooded and dotted with fields and blueberry farms.When Mr. C initially sent the print to me I was interested but not convinced.  I had no known object in the field of view for size comparison and the print itself was not well defined. I asked him what had happened prior to his discovery of the possible print.  I was looking for corroborative evidence that would point to the print belonging to something other than a human.  Mr. C believed he knew the general length of the stick found in the picture and so I was able to make a rough estimate of the print dimensions.  This still put it well within the realm of human manufacture.  However, what he described to me regarding the discovery of the print was interesting and made me take another look at the picture.The following is Mr. Cs story in his own words:James this was at the (location removed) and I had walked the dog the night before in the same area behind the campground just as the sun was going down. As we got farther down the trail which only went about 150 yards. Sargent my dog started staring deep into the woods and just started growling but he would not go too far away from me and I noticed that the fur on the back of his neck was standing straight up and like I stated he would just keep growling and staring in the same direction. And when we both heard what sounded like a large stick break he was looking like he was going to charge at something so being that he is my working dog and trained for seeking out animals and birds in stores, I could not risk jeopardizing my dog and it was starting to get dark so I decided to go back to the camper for the night. The next morning I took him for a walk out in the same area and he was fine. Then he started sniffing the ground and would not let it go or stop so I pulled him back and that is when I saw what he was sniffing it looked like a large foot print so I got down and took a closer look and decided to see how it compared with my size 10.5 shoe and then I realized that it was about 5\u0094 longer and  wider than my shoe so I put all my weight on one foot next to the print and I weigh 205 and I did not even make a dent nor leave any mark. So as I looked at the print closer it was about \u00bd\u0094to \u00be\u0094 deep so I figured that whatever made that print had to have had some serious weight to it. So Sargent was not acting up I let him search the surrounding area staying in my sight and within close proximity of me while I pulled out my cell phone and took a picture of the print. After I put it on my laptop I sent the picture to a friend in Ohio to get his opinion and all he said is I should go back and make a cast but I had to get to my next job and I had a full schedule so I had no time to go back. That is why I contacted you guys to tell me your opinion.  I would be leery of having a dog interaction as I would be afraid of getting the dog hurt or killed.I thanked Mr. C for sharing his information with me.  I also told him I was glad he had not let his dog run free the night before his discovery of the print as any large animal might react in an unpredictable manner when confronted by a barking dog.  Please see the attached photograph below:While this may not be the best photo evidence it was found to be deeply pressed into the soil and it came with interesting activity by the dog and the sound of something breaking sticks in the darkness.

            "Observed": "In 1971 I saw some very large footprints in the snow in the summer high in a Colorado wilderness area. These prints were at least half again as big as a big human foot and the stride length was much longer than any human -- at least 4 feet or longer. They looked exactly like human prints. They were not bear, I recognize those. They proceeded across several small remaining snow patches on a mountain side meadow. There were about a dozen or more clear prints. I saw none on the ground between the snow, the ground was firm and damp. I saw no other suggestive evidence, but was not searching for any. I was scared shitless and wanted to get out of there ASAP! I wondered if they may have been human, and had enlarged and spread out by the heating, melting, cooling and refreezing that occurs at that time of year in the little snow patches. But the detail was fairly preserved and one would think that any melting and refreezing would blur those details. The possibility of this phenomenon should be examined. Someone should walk through the summer snow patches barefooted and then observe the prints for a number of days during the summer when this melt/refreeze procees occurs. If the enlarging of the prints and spreading of the stride does not occur, I assume these prints I saw were not human. If they do spread out, maybe someone just walked through there barefooted. I wondered if it were a hoax, but the area was quite remote and the perpetrator would have to know someone would pass that exact spot. I don't recall if we were on an established trail or just wandering near our campsite. Also if it was a hoax, why would they put the prints in the snow, since one could not predict exactly when it would melt in the unpredictable summer weather. I have no particular interest in the existence of the Sasquatch, but as a scientist I am curious. Having seen these prints with my own eyes, I definitely believe it is possible. There were two friends were with me and we all saw the same thing.",
