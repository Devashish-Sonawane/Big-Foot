I was standing on the ground in front of a dike going around a field. the sun was just begining to set. I had taken a few steps to begin to leave when I heard rustling coming from behind me. I thought it might be a deer so I turned around and froze. I watched along the top of this dike or levee for the deer to come over the top. As the sound got closer I finally saw a head come over the ridge of the dike. As the form moved up the dike it got larger and taller, it moved over the dike no more than 50 yards from me. I could smell a musky slight skunky smell in the air. As this thing came down the same side of the dike I got down on the ground frozen with fear! I don't remember breathing but thought my heart was going to explode! At the bottom of the dike it stopped and looked around as if it knew something was in the area. As it began to walk away the pungent smell went away. When it was out of sight I got back up and ran home as fast as I could. When I got home I turned on ll the lights, changed clothes and left for town for the rest of the night.",

He saw its head first, then shoulders, then full body as it climbed the dike. It then stood on the top of the dike before coming down the near side walking toward the witness. It stopped, looked in the witness' direction and walked along the creek into the tall brush out of sight.The witness described it as a large bipedal animal, walking upright on two legs, over 7 ft. tall, weighing over 300 lb, with black, stringy, matted, long hair from head to toe. It had wide shoulders, a very athletic and thick build with unusually long arms and large hands. The animal made no sound other than from its walking. The witness was approximately 40 yards from the animal, close enough to smell a very pungent skunk, wet, thick smell. The aroma got stronger as the animal got closer and weakened as it walked away. The witness hid from the animal by crouching on the ground in the tall brush.The witness was intimidated by the experience and immediately left the area. He has not been back to the site since the incident in October 1991. He was very detailed in his recollection and admitted he will never forget the incident for as long as he lives.",
