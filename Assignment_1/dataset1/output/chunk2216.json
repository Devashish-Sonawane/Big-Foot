In summary:\u0095  The witness had the impression that the juvenile was playing hide and seek with the children who were never aware of its presence.  \u0095  Animal was 3 1/2 to 4 feet tall.\u0095  Weight was 150 lbs.\u0095  Hair was reddish-brown.\u0095  Witness was 80 yards down the trail.\u0095  Witness was unable to see the face. \u0095  The juvenile was always on two legs.  \u0095  I also spoke to the other couple about their sighting.\u0095 I camped at site # 54 on the 9th of October 2012. As it was 2 months later in the season than the date of the sighting the leaves had started to change but were still on the trees.\u0095 I measured the distance one could see from the edge of the woods and down the trail at 100 yards, which certainly corroborated the witness statement of seeing the animal from 80 yards away and down the trail.  The view from campsite # 54 looking down the trail towards the sighting area. ",

The animal moved quickly and with a very smooth gait as it crossed the road heading east toward the Sevier River.Two distinct observations she offered; the hair was \"kinda flowy\" and not like fur.   Also the gait was \"smooth and not bouncy like a human\".The sighting lasted less than 30 seconds.Click the image below for a larger version. The image shows the position of Circleville Canyon, between the Dixie National Forest and Fish Lake National Forest.",
