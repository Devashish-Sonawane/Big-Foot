            "Also Noticed": "For about three months rior to this, I noticed that we have had one very large tree that set directly behind one of our garages on the property, stripped of some of it's bark. The limbs and bark appeared to be \"torn\" from the tree and very fresh shredded wood left exposed or split. This garage area is detached from the rest of the main house and backs up to heavy woods behind it. Also,.... A larger buck deer that had been spotted in our yard in the early mornings in the past, is now missing from the area.",

I heard \"very close\" moaning or howling from our open bedroom window of our home around 3:45 in the morning. The howling and noise woke me from a sound sleep. I could not get my husband awake who was sound asleep at this time, I tried quietly. The howling or moaning at first sounded like that of another type of animal in pain (more like a large pig or cow at first) but changed to sound like something \"very large\" in size and getting very upset (VERY deep, angry tone growls).",

            "Follow-Up Report": "NOTE: The original report submission did not include the Class-A sighting. This was brought out during the interview with the witness. BFRO policy is not to change the original report submitted except to edit the location details in keeping with the privacy of the individual(s) concerned.Another investigator and I performed an on-site visit to this witness on 01 January 2007. The witness and her husband own about seven acres in the extreme southern portion of Mercer County, WV. The witness provided a sketch of her sighting and showed us the location of the initial sighting. The witness reported she observed a sasquatch hiding in her yard last summer. She was home during a time when she normally is not, performing household chores. Her kitchen window looks out toward three closely spaced hemlock trees in her yard. Something did not look right, but she couldn't put her finger on what it was. Several times over one and a half hours, she looked at the trees trying to decide what was wrong. Finally, while watching the trees, she saw a torso move. When the creature moved, it was easier to see against the trees. It had been standing in the same spot unmoving for over an hour. Only its movement to look left then right along the road below its position revealed its true form. Once the shape was identified, she immediately understood what she was looking at! Standing inside the flowing branches of her tree was a 7+ foot tall bipedal creature. Only movement betrayed its presence against the tree trunk. She closed her curtains and did not look outside until her husband came home. From that time on, she has felt uncomfortable any time she ventures outside, even with friends present. My assistant and I walked the witnesses property which extended to within a few feet of the ridge behind their home. Evident was an abundance of oak and hickory trees. The hillside was well populated with gray squirrels which announced our movements through the woods. Several game trails are present on the property, one having the clear height necessary to accommodate a very tall animal. One large dung pile was found. It had been deposited quite a long time ago making determination of its creator impossible. Near the witnesses home and having line of sight to the back door at a range of approximately 125 yards we found several long limbs interlaced against the trunk of an oak tree. The longest limb generally pointed toward the dwelling and was about 15 feet long. It had been deliberately placed and interlaced. To disassemble this structure, it required the far end to be lifted off the ground about six feet. The area around the tree was compacted leaf litter, unlike the wind blown free scatter of leaves away from the tree. A large source of water is available. Game is available: Deer, turkey, and many squirrels. The witness is very near the last house on this road and surrounded by posted land. Generally speaking it is a place where a large animal could find a well secluded place to rest. Other observations: The tree which had its bark stripped appears to be the work of a bear. The tree is well colonized with termites. Several gullies come together immediately behind the witnesses home giving good access to hide positions. Ridges are not very high behind the home, giving good avenues of escape.  ",
