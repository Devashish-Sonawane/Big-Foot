So I think has made them angry and it seems that they are mad at us.  We didn\u0092t own the property. We are not people who want the trees cut down.  But here lately we\u0092ve had knocking on trees, slapping the side of our house footsteps and growling right outside our house.  When I walked down my driveway I heard what sounded like a stick being hit against a tree trunk.  Heard running around my house late at night.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. More details:The witness\u0092 \u0093outside\u0094 dog sleeps on the front porch and usually roams the property at all hours.  The dog will no longer leave the front porch after dark.  The family has to park the car down the driveway and walk one hundred yards to the house due to the instability of the bridge that crosses the creek in front of the house.  The family feels like they are being watched whenever they walk from the car to the house.  Her kids are terrified. They heard three thuds against the house on the night prior to me calling.  One night after walking the dog and hearing the growl she heard a branch land on the back porch.  She went inside to get her husband, who got out his shotgun and shot it into the air in an attempt to scare \u0093whatever it was\u0094 away.  They do not leave dog food near the house.  The outside dog is fed in the barn during the daylight hours.  The barn is locked at night.  They do have an outdoor light but are planning to add more lights to the area and install a security camera.  These occurrences are ongoing. ________________________________________________[Matt Moneymaker Notes:ATTN American scientists,Let us know if you'd like to document this activity on site.",
