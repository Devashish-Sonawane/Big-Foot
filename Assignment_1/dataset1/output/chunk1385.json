After my family had a suspected nighttime visit from a juvenile sasquatch about a dozen years ago, I\u0092ve developed a keen interest in the subject and have read hundreds of sighting reports in the BFRO site. By learning what to listen for and following up leads, I have identified my own research site in the northeastern US where I have had a string of auditory encounters/interactions that have included woodknocks, screams, stalking, and a possible infrasound experience. I\u0092ve located a number of stick structures on my site. I\u0092ve joined my state BF association for which I have investigated an alleged Class B sighting. I have also hiked other areas of my state in the company of others more experienced than I, and have observed tracks and learned where to look for them.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on the phone for well over an hour and have since exchanged several emails with him.  I found him to be an honest and forthcoming person. His main desire was to protect his friend who owns the house that this occurred at.  This only lead me to believe him more.  He is fairly well versed in the field and wants to learn more, I found his questions to be intelligent and to the point.  I got the impression from him that he was relieved to speak to someone that wouldn't judge him.  He also seemed more relaxed after we spoke. I hope that talking to me and relating his experience gave him some sort of closure.I was able to find the house with his directions.  I had a copy of the report with me and was able to place myself in the location the witness was standing.  Given the information that he provided me with, it is my opinion that his experience is absolutely plausible.  During the months that he was there, the human population is not as prevalent as it would be in the summer months and a curious animal would be more apt to approach a house. I will be spending more time researching this location in the months to come.  This area is not too far from the Linville Gorge, also known as \"The Grand Canyon of North Carolina\".",
