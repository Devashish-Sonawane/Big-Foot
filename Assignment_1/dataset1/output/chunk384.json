            "Observed": "Immokalee,Florida 1987 - My family and I were in having an evening of fun when we heard a horrible noise coming from the direction of where our dog was outside. My husband went out to investigate because our dog sounded as if were scarred or being hurt. When my husband got to our shed he saw a large shadow up against the siding and it sounded as if our dog were being muffled. He ran back into our home thinking it was a bear or something to the effect and grabbed his gun. He then went back outside ( us trailing close behind him) and it appeared to him as if something were running down our driveway - in the meantime our dog was hidding underneath our home. My husband fired a couple of shots towards the area he thought this creature or animal was and we heard a very loud growl howl type noise, after that it got deathly quiet.",

Trying a different approach to their hunt, they crawled under very thick vegetation to access a swamp. Her husband got the gun thinking he was up against a bear standing on its hind legs. The tracks were about the size of a large man.  After the gunshot warnings the visitor cleared a canal about 15 ft. in width.  The dog was not injured.We receive a lot reports, both past and present, from this SW part of Florida. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Although this report sounds as if the witness may have seen a bear, the witness stated that she was from Pennsylvania and had seen many bears there. She stated that she was absolutely positive that this was not a bear. She observed it for about a minute from a distance of about 25 - 50 ft away. The creature's length was estimated at 5 1/2 - 6 ft long. The witness did not investigate or return to the site as she was on her way to work. During the interview, she also added that it was walking on it's knuckles and gave her the definite impression that it was a juvenile because of it's gangly appearance. It remained on all fours the entire time. We do have a number of credible reports of this nature, indicating that juvenile sasquatches may spend quite a bit of time on all fours and adults only on occasion. Also noted was the fact that it did not have any sign of a tail. Sighting took place about 100 yards from a creek and close to the Florida/Alabama border.",
