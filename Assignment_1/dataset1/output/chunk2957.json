            "Follow-Up Report": " I spoke with the witness by phone just over four months after the incident occurred.  The information provided during the phone interview accurately matched that of the initial report.  I found the witness to be credible and sincere in her interpretation of the described events.  On Sunday, March 15, 2004, the witness and a teenager were traveling in the westbound lane of Hwy 135 in northwestern Montana on a bright and warm spring afternoon.  (Note:  March 2004 was the warmest month of March on record for Montana.)  As they drove across the bridge that spans the Clark Fork River, the witness glanced to her left, (south), and noticed two figures standing near the shore of the river, approximately 250 yards from the bridge.  She described the figures as covered with reddish-brown hair, a color similar to that of an Irish Setter, the length of which was estimated at approximately 6-8 inches.  The witness described the two figures as an adult, presumably female, approximately 8 feet tall, and a juvenile, approximately 3 feet tall.  The juvenile stood only to the height of the adult's knee.  The witness described the body shape and build of the adult as very muscular, not fat and thick, with an upper torso very wide at the shoulders and narrow at the hips.  No neck was visible, as the head seemed to just connect to shoulders.   Movement observed by the witness included the adult stepping forward on its left leg, with both arms outstretched, reaching for the juvenile as if to prevent it from getting any closer to the river's edge, while the juvenile was bending forward towards the water. The sighting lasted approximately 6-10 seconds as the witness was driving 60 mph, and upon crossing the bridge the view became blocked by the recurrence of the forest bordering the river drainage. I personally visited the sighting location and verified approximate distances as well as the physical description of the shoreline.  It is a sand and gravel shoreline that extends out into the river some 40 yards from lightly forested terrain considered higher ground, but is also completely devoid of any trees or brush.  Subsequently, there is nothing to impede the view of this sandbar from the bridge.  It is the opinion of this investigator that the witness did in fact observe the figures she described in the report.  Based upon the physical aspects and terrain features of the location, there is nothing that could lead me to believe this to be a misidentification of any kind.  A Second Experience:Four months after the initial sighting, the witness returned to this location with her 8-year-old son and the teenager who was also witness to the initial sighting.  After walking around and taking some photographs of the area, all three noticed a \"horrible\" smell, \"similar to a skunk, but a much heavier, muskier stench\".  All three were frozen in their tracks until the witness suddenly felt an overwhelming urge to get the two boys out of the area immediately.  All three quickly got into the car and locked all the doors.  They observed the area for  a few minutes, anticipating to see what caused the smell, but to no avail.  The witness then rolled down the window and immediately noticed the smell, as well as the accompanying feeling of danger.  At this point, she quickly rolled up the window and drove away from this particular location, across the bridge and to the other side of the river.  They again observed, from a distance, the initial location in an effort to see the cause of the smell.  After approximately ten minutes with no success, they left the area and drove home.  ",
