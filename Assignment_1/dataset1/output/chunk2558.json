            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the mother about the incidents taking place on and near their property and can add the following details.She had never considered the possibility of sasquatch activity until after the event in 2011. She took me through the events of the night in September 2007. The mother and six of her eight children were setting up to camp in their front yard around the fire pit. She had noticed rocks rolling into the yard, but was busy getting the tents set up and had not really paid attention as to where they were coming from. They had also heard some howls nearby, but attributed them to being a fox or bobcat. Later, after everyone had settled around the fire, she noticed another rock and became a little uneasy, thinking it might be someone trying to scare them, and made her son set up his tent right next to hers.After the creature entered the camp and bumped her tent, she was able to look through her tent window and watch as her son's tent was picked up and shaken, but she could not see what was doing it. At that point in time she had no clue what might be capable of picking up her son's tent in such a manner. Her fear and confusion were elevated realizing that even a very large person would struggle to pick up and shake the tent containing her son who at the time would have weighed over 100 pounds.I spoke with her son, the same one that was in the tent, about his sighting near the garage in September 2011. He stated that he saw a large silhouette, around 7 feet tall, about 20 feet away. There was slight eye shine, caused by the light from the porch, but no facial features were visible. He was frightened and ran into the house. When he looked outside the creature was gone. It was after this took place that the mother started researching, and made her report to the BFRO.The older son was fishing with a friend in the creek behind the house when they experienced the feeling of being watched. When they started looking around, a dark creature jumped up from behind a clump of trees across the creek and ran into the woods on two legs. The area surrounding these encounters is heavily wooded and is very close to the Ohio River and the Fort Knox military reserve.",
