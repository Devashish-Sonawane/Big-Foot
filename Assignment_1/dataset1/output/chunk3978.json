She describes how something followed them for about a half mile, but oddly, they did not panic. They could hear something moving in the brush. She never saw the creature, but her companion saw a creature on two feet from about 20 feet away as it came out of the tree line. It was very tall, as he told her five years later. He didn't want to tell her at the time as he didn't want to spook her.",
