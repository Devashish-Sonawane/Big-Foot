            "Observed": "I WAS GOING UP TO HARDY AR.TO LOOK AT SOME LAND I HAVE ON WHITE HORSE MT. THE ROAD UP THERE IS GRAVEL. AS I WAS COMING AROUND A BEND IN THE ROAD I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BLACK BEAR IN THE ROAD. I HONKED MY HORN, THEN A FEMALE BIGFOOT CAME OUT FROM BEHIND SOME TREES PICKED UP WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BEAR BUT WAS A YOUNG BIGFOOT. YOU COULD TELL IT WAS A FEMALE BECAUSE IT HAD BREASTS. SHE WAS A DARK BROWN ABOUT 7 FT TALL THE BABY WAS DARK BLACK. SHE WALKED OUT FROM THE TREES PICKED UP THE BABY AND WENT BACK IN TO THE TREES. I MUST SAY I WAS SCARED. I OPENED MY DOOR TO SEE WHERE SHE WAS GOING WHEN A SMALL ROCK HIT MY CAR FROM BEHIND ME. I TURN TO SEE ANTHER BIGFOOT ABOUT 6 FT FROM MY CAR. THIS ONE WAS BIGGER ABOUT 9 FT TALL . THE BIGFOOT YELLED AT ME WITH A SOUND LIKE I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE, I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS. THIS WAS LIKE NOTHING I HAVE HEARD OR SEEN IN MY LIFE.  I GOT BACK IN MY CAR. IT WAS STILL BEHIND MY CAR THEN IT WALKED ACROSS THE ROAD AND  INTO THE WOODS. I DROVE UP THE ROAD ABOUT 150 YARDS, STOPPED AND GOT OUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I JUST SAW I WAS SCARED AND CONFUSED STILL LOOKING TO SEE IF I MIGHT SEE AND HEAR WHERE THEY WENT. WHEN I GOT MORE ROCKS HITTING MY CAR AND AROUND ME FROM WHERE THE BIG BIGFOOT WENT IN TO THE WOODS. I COULD HEAR HIM. I DON'T THINK HE WANTED TO HURT ME BUT HE WANTED ME OUT OF THERE. THIS HAPPENED EARLY MORNING IN 2008, JANUARY I BELIEVE I SEEN A FAMILY OF BIGFOOTS",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness on two occasions, Feb 25, 2013 and again on March 4, 2013.  This is an amazing, rare sighting and I wanted to double check every detail.  Early on a January morning in 2008 at approximately 7:30 am the witness was driving to the undeveloped property he inherited from his late father.  As he came around a curve he saw a black furred animal sitting in the middle of the gravel road with its back towards the witness.  The witness rolled to a stop approximately 10 feet away from the animal.  He honked his horn then immediately saw a female  approximately 7 \u00bd feet tall, covered in brown hair, swiftly walking bipedal out of the brushy, thick woods on his right to the small animal in the middle of the road.  She scooped up the juvenile with her left hand and placed it on her back, and the juvenile then grabbed her around her short neck.  The female glanced at the witness briefly as she exited into the woods downhill to his left.  The witness stepped out of his car and stood in disbelief thinking he had just been hoaxed, but then a rock hit the roof of his Mercury Sable.  The witness turned around and saw a male approximately 6 feet from the back of his car.  The Male was approximately 9 feet tall with extremely large shoulders and broad chest.  He was covered in black hair tinged with gray except for his flat nose and up to his wrinkled forehead, and he looked at the witness with intense black eyes.  The male then roared at the witness with a showing of its upper teeth.  The witness jumped back into his car and watched in his rear view mirror as the male ran into the woods in the same direction as the female and juvenile.  The following are two sketches by Sybilla Irwin, working with the witness to depict the male, before, and as he vocalized:The witness then drove approximately 150 yards to the entrance of his property.  He got out of his car and stood there in awe looking back down the hill.  He could hear rustling in the woods and snapping of branches.  He had small rocks thrown in his direction.  He waited until the noises subsided and then got back into his car and drove back the way he had come.  When he got back to the location of the sighting he noticed a dead deer on the side on the road to his left.  It was a doe nearly torn in half and gutted.  If these events are true then this is an extraordinary sighting of a family unit. The witness was extremely reluctant about coming forward with this story, fearing his reputation, but I encouraged him to share his story and submit a report.  I also hope to meet this witness personally and have him show me the exact location in the near future.This area has varied terrains and plenty of fresh water sources, as well as game for food. ",

            "Observed": "Well, this is kinda weird because I have been wanting to see a sasquatch for many years now and I believe I had a brief look at one about a week and a half ago. I was driving east on Sagamore Rd. in Sagamore hills Ohio at about 10:33 am to be exact. It was a very Hot muggy day with tempetures in the 90's. As I was driving east on this rd. their is a jogging trail that crosses the road and is actually part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park system. The trail area was about 100 to 150 yds ahead of me when from the right side of the road I seen a dark figure come out onto the road with such speed that their was no way it could have stopped to look for cars before crossing, this thing was dark brown or black from head to toe. It crossed the road and the open area before the road when I first seen it in 3 strides and it was gone. This thing had the speed of an animal and it held its forearms up high kind of reminds me of the memorial day footage. I also seen a flash of silver or gray color by the forearm and head/face area like it looked my way in the last stride it took. When I first seen it I thought heck it had to be a jogger. The more and more I thought about it I felt that it couldnt have been a jogger for a few reasons, 1 it was 90F + and I couldnt imagine someone dreesed in such dark colors from head to toe, 2nd is the speed this thing had was not humanly possible, if I had blinked my eye I would have missed it, if I would have had a camera I would have missed it anyway because of the speed. 3rd is I am 5'10'' and it took me 5-6 strides just to cross the road in that area which does not include the area that is viewable to the right of the road where the creature first stepped out into.4th is since I have seen this I have driven that road many times to and from work, I have been at about the same distance in my van and have seen joggers cross the road and their arms look like toothpicks compared to what I had seen on that day, as far as guessing a height of the creature I would say it was well over 6ft. but cannot be any more sure than that because their is nothing their to have compared it to but it looked stocky for sure from that distance.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After the witness and I investigated the location I can add the following information to his report:The witness saw the animal crossing the road before the hike and bike trail. The area is heavily wooded on both sides of the road. Besides the hike and bike trail there are several deer paths and one path that has open clearance of about three feet on each side with no ceiling. A small park nearby has stream access the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.Upon examination of the sighting distance I was able to clearly see people crossing the road on this path. They were small to the naked eye, yet readily visible. I was able to cross the road in five large steps, compared to the three steps taken by the animal. This is consistent with the witness' statement that the animal was large.Abundant food was in evidence. I noted raspberries, wild grapes, deer and apple trees nearby. This area has had reports of sightings in the past. I am labeling this as class B because of the sighting's duration.",
