When I saw this very large, seemed to be dark in color, come running across the road at a very fast speed!!!  I was very tired and thought that maybe it was a large elk or something.  So I looked over at my girlfried and she was in shock, she could'nt believe what she saw.  She was very certain that it was on two legs.  So this is what I saw just to let you know i am not the type of person that would just write something like this if it was not 100% true.  I just would like to report what I saw and try and help you guys out.  thanks.",

He noticed, in that brief time, the animal was not evenly colored, but had some lighter, possibly grey, patches elsewhere on its body. Its height was estimated to be between 6' and 7'. The impression of its non-human nature was so immediate, that the woman started crying out of fear and insisted they keep going as fast as possible. The primary eye witness noted, particularly, the incredible speed with which it crossed the highway and described it as running. It crossed from south to north over a relatively straight stretch of the road.",
