We had just built a two story addition which is situated further back on a lot (about 150 feet) into the woods from the street. This area was considered suburban but was fairly rural at that time. There are houses built along the street that are on lots of 3/4 to 1 acre. We own several acres of heavily wooded land and our house sits back on the lot further than the others. The section of woods is borderd by 3 state highways and was about 1 mile (length) by 1 1/2 miles (width)of woods and some farmland fields. At the time there were only two dead end streets that penetrated this section of woods. Another country road separates this section on the west with a State park nearby (1/2 mile from the road). This park is several hundred acres of lakes and heavily wooded areas. The area now is filled with housing and development.",

            "Also Noticed": "I do recall now after reading some accounts - about a \"path\" deep in the woods about a mile long that ran parallel to the houses. It was about 500 feet back of my house along an old stone wall. It was covered ( canopy of trees) and very dark-even on bright days. I would occasionally walk through the woods and found this path. The entrance was through the woods 1/4 mile down the street and through a dense pine grove - you would then enter an open field and then enter this dark section of woods. I found an irregular path that rambled - but always wondered why there were many broken branches and samll trees and closed in areas(like small trees pulled together) and the rocks in the wall would be all over the place - some of them were good size. I always thought that maybe some kids used this path to school or built forts or something but I now realize it was too dense and not really in the right direction to the schools.  I never heard any kids out back in all the years I have been here (almost 30 years)",
