            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by telephone for approximately 45 minutes. He was speaking from his home in the Southeast. He is a mature, lucid, and articulate man. His demeanor was calm, yet obviously disturbed by his encounter. He explained that this was the first time he had ever seen anything like this and that he was still in disbelief. While the incident had occurred at least a year prior, the witness described the vivid imagery that still plagued his memory.Having served as a career Special Forces soldier in the Viet Nam conflict with extensive decorations, the witness related that he was an avid tracker, hunter, and all-around outdoorsman. He said his military occupation was \u0093manhunter,\u0094 but he had never seen such a creature.While the vocalizations at first gave him the impression he was dealing with a large cat, he described that once he saw the subject, it was at least 2.5 meters tall, having shoulders \u0093twice as wide as any man,\u0094 and dark, muddy brown, almost black, longer hair with a \u0093cream-colored\u0094 face.His military technical jargon and vernacular were present during our conversation.  In retelling the encounter, he detailed how the creature at first \u0093growled\u0094 which appeared to be from a distance in the tree cluster, but the vibratory sensation and sonic impact felt as if the animal were standing next to him.In the ensuing moments, he saw the creature come between him and his friend and he said panic began to set in, mainly because he felt his sidearm would have been useless had the creature decided to attack himself or his friend. The witness repeatedly emphasized the girth of the animal\u0092s legs, and the rapidity of movement, as apparently the creature was also in some sort of panic mode.The witness mentioned that the lodging he had taken during his stay in the area was staffed by a couple who were very familiar with the presence of large upright bipedal animals in the location of his encounter.I subsequently visited and interviewed the couple. They explained that the witness stayed in their inn along with Steve, as well as several other miners for the duration of their mineral exploration. The couple told me of two other encounters as recently as July 2012 by miners who stayed in their inn. Then they took me to the location of the witnesses encounter, high in the surrounding hills. While we accessed the location of the encounter via ATV late in the afternoon, one of the innkeepers spotted a \"dark figure\" on the ridge across from the switchback, in a clearing on a rocky outcrop. We attempted to spot the figure again via binoculars and 9x scope without success.This location is steep, not accessible unless by the most robust of vehicles, and known for mysterious vocalizations and sightings.All details from the innkeepers correlated with the witnesses description of the events. Since the town has an extensive mining history, there is also associated lore describing \"monsters\" in the hills.",
