            "Observed": "It was Xmas eve 12/24/1980 app. 7:00pm. It was very very cold. I had just turned onto IL. R.R. 4  4 heading north and was picking up speed when I saw something in the middle of the road. There was no other cars in the area so i turned my bright lites on and started hitting my brakes. As I got closer i saw a bigfoot just standing in the middle of the road looking at me as if it was blinded by my headlights. I came to almost a complete stop as I looked at it and moved the car into the opposite lane to avoid hitting it. I came within inches of it and was looking at it the whole time. It was standing up but seemed to be kind of bent over at the waist and its was holding its right arm up against its chest (like if you would have your arm in a sling). I estimate it was well over 7 foot tall-(at the time i had a brother 6'8\" and I know it was much taller than he was). I keep saying it because I'm not sure of its sex. I was in amazement and not sure what to do. I decided to go to the next road and turn around but it was gone when I returned (app.1-1/2 -2 minutes later). The best I can remember the temp. Was around 0-fr. Or below. This is a very rural area and there is no reason anyone would be standing in the middle of the road on Xmas eve in that kind of weather dressed up like a bigfoot - esp. Who's that tall to begin with? I am a hunter and have spent many hours in the wood but, have never seen anything like that before or after.",

Facial features were very ape-like. The entire body was covered in a two inch long dark and shaggy hair. This location is next to an intermittent stream running into Silver Creek which runs into the Kaskaskia River near New Athens. ",

She slowed down because she thought it was someone who might have broken down. The thing was at the edge of the road near a creek. As she stopped it crossed the road and leaped onto a dirt bank about 5 or 6 feet off the road and went into the woods. A day or two later as she was going to work she saw something standing by the edge of the road in the same area. It was tall and dark with reddish eyes. It made no effort to come into the road and went back into the woods. All of these events occured during the early morning hours on a remote section of mountanous road in the Stoney Creek section of Carter county on Highway 91.",
