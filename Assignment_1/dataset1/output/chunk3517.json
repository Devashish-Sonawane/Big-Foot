Depending on the moon light, we could see him coming down from the woods. One night my mom said that he was coming. We went outside and we both thought we seen him walking to the house. Mom walked out to meet him. I stayed on the back porch and watched. It was probably 9pm or so. What ever it was just stopped and stood there. Then it went back into the woods fast. Mom ran back inside the house with me by the wrist. She locked the doors and loaded a shotgun. My step dad eventually got home. Whatever that was walked on 2 legs. It was not my step dad. We live just outside Sparland, Illinois.",

Untill that night, I did not know what it meant to have your hair stand on end. A somewhat large dog that we had outside barked, cried, and ran away in apparrent terror.
