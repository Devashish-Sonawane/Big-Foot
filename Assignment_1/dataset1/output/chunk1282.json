            "Follow-Up Report": "This sighting took place in October of 2001. Prior to her sighting, the witness was not a believer in bigfoot. Now, she wants to find as much information that she can. The sighting was in Woodville, TX, in Tyler County. This is located in the general area of the Big Thicket National Preserve.  Several months before her sighting, the witness and her son had gone out to feed the goats that they raised. They had noticed that the very young goats had started coming up missing. It was at night, so it was very dark in their back yard. While they were feeding the goats, they heard a low growl behind them. The growl sounded very close, but they could not see anything. Her first thoughts were, the growl came from a big cat. The thought of a bigfoot never crossed her mind. Later, they noticed another goat was missing. She started finding dead goats. They were not eaten, but dismembered. Geese starting turning up missing. On the day of the sighting, the witness was very busy cooking dinner and dealing with family matters. It was daylight outside. She looked out her kitchen window into the back yard and saw a very large animal, standing on two legs. The animal was very hairy, and was black in color. To her, the animal looked like a prehistoric man. She could only see the profile of the animal. The animal was not moving. She had a clear view of the creature. The distance was approximately fifty to sixty feet between her and the Bigfoot. She described the animal as standing 8 to 9 feet tall and weighing 800 to 1000 lbs. It had arms like an ape, hanging low to its side. It stood hunched over. She could guess the height because the animal stood next to a tree that was nine feet tall. After watching the animal for a few minutes, she sat down to collect her thoughts. The whole incident seemed very surreal to her. After realizing what had happened to her, she stood up to get another look, but the animal was gone. She figured it walked backed into the woods. Her house sat up against many acres of woods. She decided to tell her husband and son. Her husband poked fun at her. Her son grabbed his gun and went to investigate. There was no sign of the creature. When the son was looking around he heard gunshots from the woods. He heard two men yelling at each other. One saying, \"What was that?\". The other answering, \"Let's get the hell out of here.\" Since this incident they have moved the goats to a different location. The witness and her husband live elsewhere as well. Other incidents have occurred in the area. Her son, who lives in the same house of the sighting, has heard an animal moaning, groaning and breathing heavy outside the windows. Her friend who drives an ambulance has had a very large animal run across the road in front of her. Also, another friend's grandson had seen a bigfoot step out of the woods onto a road very close to where he was standing. The witnesses mentioned in this report all said, at the time of their sighting, they were very frightened. TBRC Investigator \u00a9Copyright 1999-2002 Texas Bigfoot Research Center ",

            "Observed": "My family at the time where very much into the whole camping thing. And to this day I still hunt and fish whenener the opportunity presents itself. We went somewhere in the Aok Creek Canyon, Slide rock area and camped along the river. As usual I took off on my own too fish. I was fishing along the bank. ehind me the forest my heavily treed with dense under brush. I heard footsteps. Not your typical steps, but HEAVY thumping steps. When I turned to look I saw nothing and the thumping seemed to stop. When I decided I to get bak to the more serious business of trout fishing I heard it again. I looked around again and this time when It stopped I heard very heavy deep breathing. I was scared to  and flattened my back against a tree, trying to peer around I searched for the source of the noise, but could not locate it. I waited, I tried to make myself small, I was only 13. I stayed still for 20 minutes, my back pressed flat against the tree trying to look around without moving much. All the while I could hear that thumping walking sound and sometimes breathing. It sounded soooooooo close. Finally it stopped. I regained some courage. Shrugged it off as my very good imagination and started fishing again, but I was still nervous. I felt \"watched\". Again the thumping and breathing. And this time to my left I saw it. A shadow in the dark woods, but an unmistakable one. I saw a dark brown, black body. Maybe three inch fur. Shaggy looking. Six to seven feet tall. Moving away and at an angle. Approximately 35 to 40 feet away. As soon as I saw him he was gone. The woods where thick.",
