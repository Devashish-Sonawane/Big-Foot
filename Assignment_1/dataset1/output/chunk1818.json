            "Follow-Up Report": "Update:April 11, 2015 - This report is being updated because the witness, Dan Patino, has provided additional photos and a link to the Good Morning America video, please see below.------------Spoke to the witness by phone. Estimated height was 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall.  Its speed made it appear to be jogging and its  smooth movement resembled a roller skater.  He and his girlfriend stayed the night after all, but he didn't sleep, staying up all night with a video camera. She slept in the car.In the intervening years he has returned to the area a few times to look around, but has found nothing significant.Photos were taken with a disposable camera, the attached photo shows the size and depth of the footprints compared to his:Here is a photo of their their tent taken the following morning. Just to the right was their campfire where they sat and first saw the figure:Here you can see their tent, green in color. Its in the bluff area. The Bigfoot walked several times from North to South during the sighting, up and down the beach. You can see the witness' footprints nearby to compare.  Here the tide washes some of the prints away overnight:Here you can see how the tide washed away prints near to their area:Footprint he describes as very structured as a print, unlike the soft sand in others where the prints caved in to a point in the hole:Sandal print for comparison:Here his sandal went from the tip of the edge of a print, down to an angle to the middle or the \"V\" in the bottom center. Sandal is a size 8:Here is a long shot of the tracks, possibly two sets of tracks as it walked:This area the sand was wetter. His footprint is to the left to compare. Seagulls were participating too:Down further to the South of the sighting, about 1/8 of a mile, it was very deep, soft sand. Prints are very conical and deep, not flat:In this picture the witness is covering his face. Being in Law Enforcement he didn't want to be seen. Notice the stride:This was his attempt at leaping and putting his weight into it as he made comparison tracks:The witness returned a year later with Peter Byrne to the point he remembered the tracks went to. The brush was so thick that he had to push in to find the trail, just feet in was a honed out trail that was tall and wide. He followed the trail up the hill to the highway.At the time of the sighting Dan was a USFS Law Enforcement Level II Ranger. At the time of the airing of the Good Morning America show he moved on to also working as a Police Officer. Here is a photo taken around the time of the sighting, he was on vacation at the time of his sighting and not working as a Ranger:Photo of Dan and Peter Byrne taken circa 2005:Here is the Good Morning America story on Dan's sighting:",
