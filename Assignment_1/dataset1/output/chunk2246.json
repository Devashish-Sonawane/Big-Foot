            "Also Noticed": "My Dad had a strange occurance on the hill side opposite our house. One of our dogs he belived had downed a deer or got stuck in a ground hog hole and he went to get him back home. When he finally caught up to him, he noticed the dog was not stuck nore chasing anything. What the dog was doing was looking in a direction that lead deeper into the forest with his ears up and very focused on something. This dog wasn't afraid of anything and would rome these hills looking for anything to get into. On more than one occasion he would come back with porcupine quills stuck in him and various cuts and gashes after getting into fights with various other animals. He would also hunt ground hogs until he came up with one and killed it. He went about 85 lbs or so , so he wasn't exactly a small dog. Lab/German Shepard mix if I'm not mistaken.Anyway, here he was NOT chasing after what ever it was that got him excited in the first place. My Dad has other details I do not know about.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on 3/18/05 by telephone.Three things occurred in rapid succession:1. The horses ran up to the barn; they were very agitated, as if something had spooked them.2. The family dog was facing the field where the horses had been and was growling intently at something.3. The witness saw a creature running in the field.  It was:- Approximately 200 yards away (the witness is far from certain of the exact distance)- The creature had a massive chest, muscular shoulders; this made the most impression on the witness.- It was dark brown to black in color. The head seemed darker than the rest of the body.- It was running toward the house.  In retrospect, the witness believes it was chasing the horsesThe sighting lasted about 3 seconds before the creature veered off to the left. The witness pointed out that the area it ran to was toward a creek where other odd incidents had occurred as noted in the submitted report.I later spoke with the witness' mother.  She shared the following:She does remember the incident well. She said that her son was so scared his lips had turned blue and he could not speak. After he calmed down, he said that he had seen something running in the field. Her husband went down to check out the area but found nothing. She said that she and her husband did not realize at the time that their son had seen something running on two legs. They had assumed it was a four legged animal and could not understand why it had frightened him so. It was much later as the family discussed the incident that they realized it was a two legged creature.She also conveyed an incident of her own that occurred the winter after her son's sighting.  At the time she did not realize what she had seen. It was snowing hard and she was heading to work at approximately 3:00 p.m. She got her car stuck at the end of their long driveway. A logging service road intersected their driveway very near where the car got stuck. As she was digging herself out a \"man\" came into view down on the service road approximately 50 yards away. She did not give it too much attention because she was late for work and needed to get her car unstuck. She did think it odd that this \"man\" was walking around during the heavy snow. The \"man\" walked a short distance then sat down in the snow and appeared to be digging for something. This too she thought was very odd. The \"man\" appeared to be wearing a dark, heavy overcoat. It walked in an odd sort of manner, not quite like a human.  Only many years later did she give consideration to the idea that she may have seen a Bigfoot.",
