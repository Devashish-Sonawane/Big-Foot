            "Follow-Up Report": "The woman was driving southbound on Saturday morning, September 26, 2015. It was such a hot morning she remembered looking at the dashboard of her car to see the temperature at 86 degrees at 10:40 am. Down the road she noticed a blue car heading toward her and then saw a bipedal creature step out from the opposite side of the road just as the blue car passed it. It was about 50 yards away. She has lived in the area for many years and has seen many different animals cross this road, but never anything that looked like this or moved as fast. She didn\u0092t think the people in the blue car had noticed it.She said it was not running but crossed in a very smooth fast clip. The right arm was swinging in front just as it stepped out and she noticed the left arm swing and the right again as it made 2 steps across the road.  Right to left.The creature didn\u0092t seem to be more than 6 ft high, and it was very thin so thin, she explains that if it were a human she would say it was emaciated. It had mossy gray hair completely covering it body except the areas from mid chest to neck and the front forehead hair; those were reddish brown. The hair was matted and tangled. It was not shiny. The forehead seemed very high, higher in the front and the back of the head sloped down. She doesn\u0092t think the high forehead was hair because she feels it would have been waving or moving as it crossed the road. There appeared to be no neck. The area that it was crossing into has a clump of trees with wet land behind it. She believes it stayed in the trees as she passed it because she would have been able to see it come out the back. It didn\u0092t. She admitted she could have stopped to look but she was very frightened and she was pretty sure it was in the trees.Beyond the wetland area it is heavily forested. There isn\u0092t another public road for about 8 miles.From the side it was coming from are a few homes and a blue berry farm that grows other items in the fall. Since her sighting she was told of two more sightings. One was a group of men pulling over to relieve themselves at night very near her sighting location. Something large screamed at the men very close to them and chased them away. The other is the road crossing that she speaks of in her report.The people living in the area when asked report rocks thrown at windows, unknown screams, whistles and very bad odors that come and go.We have an open investigation at the blue berry farm due to ongoing activity.

            "Follow-Up Report": "I called the witness, B.H., on the afternoon of February 25, 2009. The witness was very credible in the retelling of his encounter, which took place two years ago in a wilderness area of the Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon. This witness was very cooperative, and sent along several photos of the area.I asked B.H; \"How far away were the strange, unidentified sounds from your location, and where was your son in relationship to you?\" He described their relative locations as an off-angled pyramid; B.H. located at the left corner of the base, his son located at the right corner of the base (1/4 mile apart), and whatever it was making those strange sounds higher up toward the ridge, about 50 to 60 yards somewhere in front of him and to his right. At first he thought it sounded like a coyote bark, or maybe even a bear making a \"woofing\" sound. He then realized that it was not one of those creatures, but something else all together. He couldn't put the screeching/guttural/howling sounds to anything that he was familiar with; and he has been outdoors for most of his life backpacking and hunting. He thought his son could be in trouble, and he took off in that direction as fast as possible.There were four to five very loud screeching/guttural/howling sounds heard over several minutes. The sounds lasted three to four seconds each time. B.H. decided to go to where his son was located. As he was leaving he heard one last moaning sound. These sounds were also heard by the son, causing him to be concerned.Two days prior, his son (L.H.) found what he thought was a large bed about 300 yards in front and to his left of where B.H. first heard those strange sounds. B.H. never saw this bedding area. The following is a hand-written message from the witness regarding the bedding area, as stated by his son: \"I did talk to my son, L.H., and asked him about that area we talked about. He said it was a large 6 -7 foot radius in and among brush and branches. The bed itself was completely void of any debris, and it was against a large fir tree. He said he could remember where it was, and I've included it with this email. According to L.H. it was approx. 200-300 yards up the meadow and to the left, about 300 yards below the ridge line. And, almost a perfect 45 degrees from the location of the calls or vocalizations we heard. Hope that helps.\"Meadow where incident happened.Note: The sounds came from the trees that are located just up and to the left of this witness as he stands in this photo, at about 50 to 60 yards up and behind him. His son's location at the time when the sounds were made was approximately 1/4 mile away, in a straight line to the witness' left.This area is located just a few miles due east of the Oregon Caves, and is close to the Bigfoot Trap that was built in the Siskiyou National Forest in 1974. The witness' directions were very precise, and I found the location as mentioned in the report on my topographical maps. The witness and his son are now confirmed believers in sasquatch creatures as being real.",
