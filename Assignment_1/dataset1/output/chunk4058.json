Steven Leanues picked up what appears to be a decomposed foot that the boys found in the woods off Pantheon Road. Police Chief Frank Alvilhiera sent it to the medical examiner, who determined it is not human, although it appears to have five toes. But what is it? Alvilhiera said it might be a bear paw or perhaps it belonged to a different animal, although it appears to be human. Until the medical examiner does further testing, its identity remains uncertain. \u0093It will take some time before we hear any official results,\u0094 Alvilhiera said. In other words, big foot remains a mystery. Lakeville Police Department Officials are trying to determine whether this object found in the woods of Lakeville is a foot, and, if it is, who it belonged to.",
