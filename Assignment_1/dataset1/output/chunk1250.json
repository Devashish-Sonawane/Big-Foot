The animal was very large and probably             weighed over 500 pounds.       2.) As it rapidly walked off to the West, he           noticed that it had very long arms.       3.) There was a street light adding illumination            several yards behind the creature.       4.) Several old mining tunnels are a short             distance to the Northwest.       5.) The occasional high pitched howls heard            in the neighborhood would last about ten            seconds and continue for up to thirty minutes. The link to a recording he is referring to is the 1994 Ohio - Moaning Howl.        6.) The story he told about his neighbor's sighting            took place in the same area.",
