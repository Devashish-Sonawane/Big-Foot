Thinking it was my uncle looking for me,i moved forward and what i saw was beyond belief.I first saw it as it came onto the road about 50 feet in front of me.It stood about 6 or 7 feet tall and looked like it had the mange.The hair on it's body was short and there was several bare spot's on it's torso and leg's.It probably weighed about 250 pounds,more or less.It's head was round,very small ears,and almost no neck.It stood and looked at me for what seemed like an hour, although the encounter only lasted a few seconds at which time it  slowly turned and walked back the way it came ,stopping to turn and look at me only once.I have never ran so fast in my life.I made it out of the woods about one hour later and never told a soul except my Grandmother,five years after it happened.",

            "Observed": "I was camping at Jones Creek at exactly the 4 mile marker on July 7, 2014. The woods were very quiet and only one guy on a 4 wheeler came past me and then again leaving much earlier that day. Just at dusk I heard a yell like no other animal I have ever heard about a quarter mile south. It lasted about 10 seconds. A minute or two later it happened again only louder. The hair stood up on the back of my neck. About 5 minutes later another yell comes about a quarter mile north of me only this time its 3 times louder. It yelled 5 separate times with about 10 seconds between each 10 second long yell. These yells were much stronger of a voice than the first two yells. About 2 minutes later the first yeller did it again only it sounded like it was further south. I don't believe a human could be as loud as this was at a distance and the voice was far too big. I was scared to death and spent the night with my gun in my hand laying frozen in my completely dark tent trailer. I was afraid to turn any lights on just pretended to be asleep. At 4:30 am the first log truck went by  followed by several others so I felt safe again.",
