I have listed this report as a class \"A\" because the witness also related a sighting encounter to me.  He was in a deer blind and looking accross a large corn field as he watched a dark figure walk out of the woods and proceed along the far side of the corn field.  He said that he suddenly realized that the corn, which was fully grown by that time of year and \"6-7 feet tall,\"  was only covering the lower part of this figure, and he could clearly see the shoulders and upper arms swinging as it walked.  He also noticed the quick speed with which the figure covered the distance of the field, even though it \"was not running.\"     The witness is from a trapping and coon hunting family.  These are activities that put an individual into the most inhospitable spots that any area has to offer.  He remembers as a child being carried through swamps at 3 in the morning on his dad's shoulders as they followed their dogs.  His dad has had encounters of his own, as well as other family and friends.  Encounters date back to the 60's.",
