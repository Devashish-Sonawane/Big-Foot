This I felt was voided when I discussed the length of the legs in relation to the size of the body.  A bears legs would be 1/4 to 1/3 the total trunk length, not equal length.  If it had been a moose or large deer looking straight on, it may have look as though someone standing but that would have been identified when the creature turned and went off into the brush. This is also about 200 to 230 miles South East of one of the two Alaska areas where most sightings occur.  There is nothing but wilderness between these two areas.Follow-up report conducted by Investigator Bryan Turner.           ",
