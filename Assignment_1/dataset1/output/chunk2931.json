            "Follow-Up Report": "The gentleman visited his brother in Red Lodge.  On June 30, they went hiking around Rosebud Creek. Google earth image of the location:He took several photos with his iPhone, and when he reviewed them that night, he saw something he hadn\u0092t noticed while taking a photo at the creek - a solid black object sitting near the creek.Original photo:Negative of the original:When he returned the next day with his father, the large black figure was no longer there. He had his father sit in the same place (there was about one hour\u0092s difference in the time of day) for size comparison. His father is about 6 feet tall, and the black figure sits much taller, and is much broader in size.  Photo comparison with Dad:Cropped photo with Dad:Cropped photo of the original:Original photo enhanced:A photo was also taken of where the black object was sitting before they recreated the photo, and broken tree branches were found: Interestingly, the tree branches were taken from was over 20 feet away.I've added a photo of a black bear sitting, to compare the posture:Also, these are images of \u0093Patty\u0092s\u0094 back, stills taken from the Patterson-Gimlin film for comparison: It is clear something large and black is in the photo. Although there are black bears in the area, what is pictured does not appear to have black bear characteristics when it sits.  It seems a bear would place its arms in a different place.  Also, most bears would have not remained still as the hikers approached.",
