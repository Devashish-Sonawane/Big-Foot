She had not heard that sound again until this current event;--during the Southern California event, as well as this current report, just before the howls, she felt that something had been watching her;--her house is in the county (well outside city limits), on a tree covered hill;--she felt the howl came from the other end of the hill from where she was;--she had a high powered flash light with her and tried to see what made the sound, but saw nothing;--what most alarmed her was her dog's behavior; and--she did not look for footprints or other evidence, because she was scared and didn't think she would know what footprints or other disturbances would look like.",

Numerous instances recently 6/29/2002.  about five thuds then in another location 3 thuds- Not a woodpecker or human in that area. Came back armed as I had a VERY creepy feeling in the area.  A whitetail deer wheezed for a constant 15-20 minutes as I returned about 15 minutes after the thuds.  I was camoed at this point, down wind, totally dark out and about 175 yrds from the deer. - basically it wasn't me the deer was alarmed about.",

Like many persons who have had this type of unexplained experience, it has made a mark on my psyche that has been permanently etched despite the ridicule poured on me (by persons who in fact were not there). Scientifically one may NOT deny or affirm the existence of a thing about which we have little information.  For instance, in the 1600's if one were to speak of electricity and television they would be deemed mad and a witch.  Now you read this by just such means as were previously thought non-sense.  We know it is fact now.  Some day, I believe, this rare ape will present us with irrefutable evidence of it's existence like being a little too slow in front of a mack truck or something.
