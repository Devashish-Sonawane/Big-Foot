            "Follow-Up Report": "I had a very nice chat with the witness. He was glad to get it off his chest. He also had many questions. As he mentioned, he was there just to get away from civilization for a while. Not hunting, just camping. Just some peace and quiet in the forest. Well, he didn't get the peace and quiet. No fires were allowed that year due to drought. All he had was a head lamp. That was all he needed because he was just going to read a book. But he forgot his book so he was just laying there watching the forest go from light to dark. When the whistling began it seemed like \"more of someone whistling a tune, more than a bird call.\" This was \"just a few feet away from me literally\" and within seconds came the tree knock. As stated the whistle was from the east of him and the knock to the south. Then came the steps. He estimated they began no more than 10 feet away. He \"felt the heavy thud-thud-thud of the steps and I could hear the gravel and rocks crunching under the feet\". He screamed \"every profanity I could muster.\" The creature stopped (as if to listen?) and then kept going. He felt the creature \"stopped no more than 1-2 feet from the front of my tent\" while he was screaming. He could see nothing because of the rain flap configuration on his tent.  After it (or they) walked off the forest became silent. He gathered himself for about 30 minutes before he called the sheriff. The only thing to add to the conversation with the sheriff (documented in the report): Neither of them brought up a Sasquatch. Second event: He was awakened by the sounds of knocks around 2AM. He started hearing more tree knocks in the same general area of the last time, and then the whooping sounds started. First came a whoop from the nearby tree knock area, and then some whoops a few seconds apart maybe a mile away, and then more whooping noises and tree knocks even farther away, possibly across the canyon. The witness had no working knowledge of Sasquatch before these events, nor any preconceived notions. He had heard of them, probably seen an item or two in the media but that was it. Even though he is a hunter and spent hours upon hours in the forests, nothing ever gave him pause for thought about Sasquatch, until that night.",

In the summer of 1999 we were working on a cabin that my friend was building in Guernsey County about three miles from Seneca Lake. Around 2 AM we were awakened by a series of screams. We had no idea what they were. Later we figured they were a bobcat. When I listened to your recording I am positive that is what we heard and everyone agrees. I have heard it one other time in 1999, but not since. My friend who owns the cabin and his son also has heard this scream on other occasions.",
