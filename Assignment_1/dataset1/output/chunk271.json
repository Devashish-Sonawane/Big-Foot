About five minutes after I went outside, I noticed a faint, but still very pungent, odor on the breeze. Kind of a cross between skunk, rotting carcass, & very dirty wet dog.  I've lived in the area all of my life, and hunted around the local hills and gulches, and have not encountered a smell quite like this before or since.  The smell came in on the breeze from the west of the trailer, up the hill from the property.",

The following details can be added to the report.--The witness lived at the house for two years, which is located at about 2800 feet in elevation.--The witness never heard anything similar during that time, except a single growl one time prior to this event.--The witness left the property not long after this event.--The single \u0093growl\u0094 lasted for 5-7 seconds and was deep and throaty.  The growl then rose to a higher pitch before it ended.--The witness is very experienced with local wildlife and had heard mountain lions before.  This was not similar.--Whatever made the sound seemed very large, due to the volume and depth of the growl.--His dog did not wake up during the event and never seemed scared to go outside or in the woods.--The witness looked for prints around the area but found nothing but dog and deer prints.",
