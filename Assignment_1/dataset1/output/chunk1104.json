            "Observed": "On the early morning of labor day a few of my friends and I decided that we would drive across the state of Florida, from Miami to Naples in hopes of surfing some of the swell that Hurricane Gustav was sending to Florida's Gulf Coast. At approximately 6:00A.M we left from Florida International University traveling west on the Tamiami Trail. The weather that day was relatively clear but as I mentioned we had a hurricane passing close to south Florida a few days earlier so everything was still quite humid and the winds were beginning to calm down at about 15 knots to the west. It was near the area of big cypress about 15 minutes from the worlds smallest post office, where the landscape had plenty of saw grass in shallow water and large trees at a distance of about a mile off the road where I saw a figure that seemed to be watching the road as we drove past. This creature was definitely not a person. I know that it was not a person because we had only seen about 5 cars in the entire length of the trip thus far. Whatever it was, it appeared to be large, at least the size of a person, but it was dark, with a wide body structure, and even from the distance at which I saw it (maybe 300-500 yards) it looked as if it was covered in hair. The creature was standing next to a palmetto, and we passed it quite quickly. about 10 seconds after we passed it It came to my attention that I should probably tell my friend to turn the car around to see if I could get a better look. We stopped, drove back to the site, and It was gone. But as I got down from the car there was a very strange smell in the air that was nothing like I had ever smelled before, almost like a wet dog that had been covered in eggs. My guess was that maybe the creature had crossed the road, heard our car and checked us out, and that it realized that it did not like us so much and simply crouched down and hid. Nobody else in the car saw the creature, I was sitting in the back seat on the passenger side, the front seat passenger was asleep and the driver was simply concentrating on the road. I only saw this thing for a few seconds but it left quite an impression on me. Before this I thought that stories about Bigfoot were interesting but I would dismiss them saying that I would believe it when I would see it. But after seeing how remote this area was and how large the Everglades really are, I am now certain that there is a possibility that there is something out there.Thank you for responding to my report and feel free to give me a call at your convenience, if I do not pick up the phone it is probably because I am in class so leave me a message and I will contact you as soon as I can. Thanks David and let me know if there is anything else I can do. All the best,XXXXXXXXXXFlorida skunk ape witnessMiami",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness was interviewed by phone on 09/19/08 for approximately 45 minutes. He acknowledged that he was not necessarily an \"all out believer\" in the existence of Sasquatch at the time of his experience, but had seen numerous television specials on the subject and was well aware of many of the details of the phenomenon. In addition to his report, he also acknowledged the following information;-They were driving with the windows open.-It was the instant smell he described as a rotten egg/wet dog smell, that alerted him to look up and out the window.-Upon looking out the open back seat passenger side window, he immediately noticed the silhouette of the figure, standing next to a small sable palm, looking at the road, at about 300-500 yards, standing in the tall grass. -He later surmised that the creature crossed the road, which is why its strong smell lingered.-He stated that the sighting lasted about 5-7 seconds before roadside trees blocked his view. -The witness stated that the figure was 5'-7' in height, and appeared dark brown to black in color. -The figure was standing, facing the road, with arms at its side, and appeared \"REALLY wide\", with a shoulder width of 3 1/2' to 4'. -It appeared to have a proportional head, with no visible neck.-It's arms hung below the grass line and appeared disproportionally long.-No other people in the car noticed the figure. -The witness alerted the driver to turn around, and upon their return, the figure was not visible.-The witness was adamant about what he saw, and steadfast in his assertion that it was not human. It is the impression of this investigator that this witness likely saw and identified a Sasquatch creature. Additionally, this sighting occurred in the same general area of previous sightings of Sasquatch creatures, footprints of an apparent creature, and was the general site of the BFRO Florida expedition of February 2008 where calls, knocks and a probable sighting occurred through a thermal imager.",

The road went down to a creek.We went down to the creek and on our way back, we pushed our bikes back up the road because it was steep.The road goes up along side a canyon,and was old asphalt turned light gray and crumbling.We were maybe a third of the way back up.It was quiet ,then suddenly a crashing breaking sound came from across the canyon.There was something running like a man,covered in dark hair, face humanoid ,right towards us, down the other side of the canyon.It was breaking small trees about 1 to 2 1/2 inches in dia. on its way down like they were made of balsa wood. We both saw this at the same time.It was making a bee line towards us.It scared the hell out of us and we ran as fast as we could trying to bike up the hill but it was faster running in the end, until we got nearer the top.There was no way it was a bear.It was clearly running like a man and the head was small like a man, with dark eye sockets .It was moving fast as it was a steep grade it was coming down.Whether it was running from something or at something, i dont know.",

They were on an abandoned mining road coming up from Deer Creek when \"everything went cold and silent\" right before their sighting.For three or four seconds they had an unobstructed view of a bipedal creature, approximately 100 to 150 feet away, running down the side of the canyon.  While the witness didn't get a good look at the face, he did see that the creature was seven to eight feet tall, covered with dark brown hair, and had big shoulders and no neck.  There were leaves stuck in its hair from the small trees it smashed through as it ran.  After frantically pedaling and pushing their bikes uphill for about a quarter mile, they stopped and looked behind them. At that point they could no longer see or hear the creature.",
