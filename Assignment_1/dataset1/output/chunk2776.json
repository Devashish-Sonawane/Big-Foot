I spoke with all three witnesses about their experiences.At about 2 a.m. while walking near the cemetery John found what appears to be a large barefoot footprint, 14 inches long and 6 inches wide. I could see all the imprints from the toes. The print, which was in mud alongside the road and appeared to be several weeks old.[A possible 14 in x 6 in footprint in the mud alongside the road.]",

            "Observed": "It happened so long ago it seems surreal to me but I saw bigfoot with my friend in 1974 in Woodinville Washington. I lived on a piece of property that had 4 houses on about 20 acres. I was 9 at the time and so was my friend.  There were 8 to 9 ponds with a creek connecting them.  They were small ponds average size probably 20 by 30 feet.  There was a field on one side of the upper ponds and a hillside on the other with dense fir trees of various size. It was a fall day probably October and around 4pm and it was kind of dark and cloudy with a medium rain fall.  From the start of one pond to the end of the last pond it was probably 150 to 200 yards. My house was about 100 to 150 yards from the sighting.  My friend and I were catching crawdads in the ponds. We had probably been out there for a couple of hours when it happened. I was close to the ponds on the field side and my friend was behind me about 10 or 15 feet on the field side.  I looked up the hillside 20 feet up and 40 to 50 yards away where I saw a creature 8 feet tall walking upright at a angle going up the hillside.  The hillside was about 125 feet tall. It was big I yelled at my friend, it turned and looked at us.  My friend did not know what I was yelling about.  I started to run towards my house.  I ran right by my friend yelling.  He then saw it and started running behind me. I was terribly scared as was my friend. I only saw it for about 5 or 10 seconds but I know what I saw.  It was big and walking upright.  It looked like the bigfoot from the patterson-gimlin film honestly.  I recall it being black or dark brown with short to medium hair.  I talked to my friend a couple of years ago and we talked about the incident and he agreed with me about what happened.  I had not talked to him for 20 years plus about it. We live in different places now and alot has changed but we know what we both saw and with out a doubt it was a bigfoot.",
