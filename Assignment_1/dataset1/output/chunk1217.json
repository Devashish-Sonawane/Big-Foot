            "Observed": "I was on my way from my house in Stevens Point, Wisconsin to Hayward, WI for a fishing tournament on the Chippewa Flowage. My team partner and I left Stevens point at 3 AM in the morning on Friday, July 12 to practice for the tournament on the following Saturday. The route that I take goes through Phillips, WI. However, I have a shortcut that takes me around the town of Phillips. Specifically, I turn west onto Dama Rd. off of HWY 13. I then take Dama to Mink Ranch Rd. and turn right heading north. I then take another right onto E Wilson Flowage Rd. It is at this point when we saw what we believe may have been a Sasquatch. It was roughly 5:15 AM when I turned onto E Wilson Flowage Rd. When we turned about 70 yards in front of us in the middle of the road was a big black animal that had its rear end facing us. At that point it we startled it and it took a quick look at us and ran into the woods. That's when we both thought we had just seen a gorilla. It was easily six ft tall and when it ran into the woods we could tell that the creature had a 45 degree angled back from head to rear end. Not at all like a bear. Additionally, it ran into the woods using its front two arms like an ape. Using its knuckles like an ape. We continued on with our trip questioning what we saw. I just happened to google Sasquatch in Wisconsin and saw that Phillips is a hot bed for activity. So I had to make a report.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Matt on 8/8/2013. He vividly recalled the incident. When they came to the intersection of Mink Ranch Rd. and East Wilson Flowage Rd. they saw a tall, black creature crouching in the middle of the road about seventy yards ahead.  Immediately both witnesses exclaimed, \"Bear!\" The creature had its back to them, and when it heard the vehicle it turned its head and right shoulder towards them, paused for a second, and then ran, on its back legs only, very quickly off into the woods.  Its back was angled forward from its waist at about 45 degrees, and it didn't use its arms for locomotion; rather it appeared the arms were used only for balance, and its palms were turned outward.  There was no natural neckline, and the head was shaped like a gorilla and appeared to be sitting directly upon its shoulders - \"...like a football player on steroids.\" And its upper torso was extremely thick and broad.Both witnesses observed that it ran into the woods with ease, and not like a circus bear.  They slowly drove past the spot where it ran into the woods, but it had disappeared. Neither one said anything for a couple of minutes.Price County is located in the far northern part of Wisconsin, and has a total area of 1,278 square miles (3,310 km2), of which 1,253 square miles (3,250 km2) is land and 26 square miles (67 km2) (2.02%) is water. The highest natural point in Wisconsin, Timms Hill at 1,951 feet (595 m), is located in Price County. The Chequamegon National Forest is partially located in Price County.",
