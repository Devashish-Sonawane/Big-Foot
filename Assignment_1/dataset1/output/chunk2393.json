It was about 300 feet from me and I pulled my rifle up on it to see it with the scope and was able to follow it just long enough to see that it looked to be dark brownish with what looked to be possible moss on it.",

            "Observed": "Hello. My family and I took a trip to the Sequoia National Forest and were walking a trail near the Bear Hill Trail. I was taking pictures and videos of my children when I noticed a couple of footprints up the side of the hill.  The toes and heel indentations were very noticeable, very large and very deep into the dirt. The stride between the prints were approximately 6 feet apart. I also took photos and videos of the prints and with my foot next to them. What was very intimidating was that I am 6'6\" and weigh 380 lbs., so I'm no small guy at all. I wear shoe size 13 extra wide. These prints made my foot look childish. I tried my hardest to dig my foot into the dirt as deep as the prints were, but to no avail. Whatever made these prints had to be a considerably large animal. I then went back to the entrance of the Bear Hill Trail and walked up that trail and matched the area where I found the original prints, but higher up. It was there I found a third print and took a couple of pictures of that print as well, with one being my foot next to it to get the size. I have always been an avid believer in the Sasquatch animal, but I never thought that I would ever find anything like this.",
