            "Observed": "I was telling a long-time friend about a BF sighting a common friend of ours had related to me. He said, \"You know, I saw something several years ago.\" He went on to say he was fishing on the Sioux River near Big Rock in Bayfield County as he had for nearly 20 years. He was upstream where the River crosses Big Rock Road. He was walking along the bank on the way back, focusing on his footing as he had chest waders on carried his rod. He looked up as a black animal, 3-4 feet tall, on the next bend in the river, about 60-70 feet ahead of him, seemed to do at the same time. He watched as it immediately \"launched\" itself away from him \"arms outstretched\" and a \"blur\" it moved so fast, \"cut into the water at least 10 feet into the river and made a splash\" then disappeared under the water. He watched and waited at least 3 minutes for it to surface but it never did. He thought about going to the sandbar it was originally on to check for tracks but would have had to backtrack several bends in the river, cross, then \"bushwhack\" all the way on the opposite side. He was already sweating and decided to just walk on out to the car. He said, \"I can just kick myself for not going back to check.\"",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Joe, the actual witness spoken about in this report. As described, he was walking downstream on the Sioux River, after trout fishing. He saw an approximately 4 foot tall creature with black fur, on the opposite river bank, \"launch\" itself into the deepest pool of water in the river. The head was rounded, no snout, no pointed ears. It held its outstretched arms in front of it, and dove into the water, head first. He said the creature launched itself like a frog, and dove like a human would into the water. The fur was coarse, not long. Weight estimate at 200 pounds. Joe has frequently seen bears, when fishing the area, and definitely knew it was not a bear. Especially because the arms and legs were completely outstretched when diving. A bear cannot do this.He saw it for 3 seconds, before it entered the water. It did not surface. Joe believes it swam away underwater. Joe continued to his car, saw nothing else, heard nothing else, smelled nothing unusual.To this day he is puzzled as to what he saw.",

            "Observed": "My wife and I had been working as the cleaning crew for a new housing development displaying various model homes on the edge of the city for a couple of months. As part of our contract we were required to clean a trailer used by the construction workers as an office, the trailer itself was at the bottom of a hill at the back of the development with a road coming down to it and turning to the right making a wide U. One night my wife and I had just finished cleaning and were getting ready to load all of our equipment back into our car, when my wife walked out of the trailer carrying supplies and looked off to her right to a shallow clearing near the trailer. She claims she saw a tall hairy figure with a pointed head watching her from behind a tree with Y shaped arms surrounded by small brush in the middle of a small clearing about 25ft. from us. She immediatly froze and watched it for 2-3 min. where she claimed it leaned to the side to look at her from around the tree, she then got upset and ran back in. I was rolling the cord to a vacuum when she told me of what she had seen, we turned off the lights because she felt we were being watched and I walked outside looking at the area she described but saw nothing so we ran to our car which was parked an equal distance in the other direction facing the area and turned on the headlights. We saw nothing when we did so we left the lights on and ran back in to finish locking up and then got back in the car, before we left we turned the car off and sat in the dark for about 10 min. hoping to catch a glimpse of whatever she saw. The following day we showed up early while there was still daylight and looked at the area, we were quite familiar with the immediate area and could not find anything nearby that she could have missidentified, nor did we see anything that may have been placed there the night of, the tree itself was about six feet up untill the arms split, and what she saw was a good shoulder profile. We followed several paths in the area that all lead into a thick wooded area with no housing behind it but found nothing before turning back.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on September 9, 2008. These details can be added: The couple had been cleaning the office trailer for several hours. During that time they had heard brush popping and movement around the trailer but had attributed it to deer because deer were plentiful in the area. The witness stated that the blinds were open on the windows and on at least two occasions something banged on the side of the trailer.  She turned off the vacuum cleaner and they both stood and listened but heard nothing. Then she started it again and it happened a second time. Her husband stepped outside thinking it was possibly a branch banging against the trailer. He returned saying that there were no branches close to the trailer. They continued to work and had nearly completed their cleaning when the witness stepped outside to take trash to the dumpster. The dumpster was twenty five feet from the trailer and the tree where her sighting occurred was five to ten yards away from the dumpster. The witness had the feeling of being watched so she turned to her right. She looked at the tree and saw a tall silhouetted figure standing behind it, looking at her. She froze in her tracks and stared at it. As she stood there staring at it, it leaned to the right side of the tree to look at her. Terrified, she ran inside the trailer.The witness could see the top of its head, shoulders and its arms. She estimates the height of the figure to be at least 7ft. She could not see any facial features. She reports that the hair appeared to be black. The hair on its head was relatively short and became longer as it reached the neck and shoulder area. The hair on the arms was three to four inches long. It was shaggy and messy. The body was stocky weighing approximately 350 lbs. There was no odor associated with her sighting. Before leaving the area they sat in the car and heard a strange chirping or whistling in the bushes. Her husband whistled back and was answered by more whistling. The witness stated this occurred at least four more times along with rustling in the bushes. Her husband got out of the car and investigated but did not see anything. This area is very close to the Government Canyon State Natural Area, 8622 acres of protected wilderness. ",
