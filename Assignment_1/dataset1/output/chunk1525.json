            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke on the phone with the witness, who lives in the SoCal area, for approximately one hour. He related his experience in a clear and lucid manner, and was articulate with regard to the details of the event.He had, along with his traveling companion, been camping/hiking/fishing various locations in OR and WA for vacation and had found this campground to be ideal, being close to the highway but also lush, and having good access to the river.Their campsite was located close to a path that lead to the river and was next door to one of the campground comfort stations. There was only one other campsite occupied in the campground, also a couple, and it was on the other side of the campground about 60-70 yards away.The witness related having been awakened at approx 5AM by the very loud, very close, \"human-sounding\" groans. He described the sound as \"almost human\" but so deep and loud that that the sound vibrated his diaphragm. His girlfriend was awake and asked him if he had heard the \"three grunts\" and he knew instantly that he was not dreaming, and that it was not a figment of his imagination.The witness remarked that his experience with bear raiding a campsite usually involved rifling through the cooking gear, and in this case, there were pots and pans as well as plates with food residue still on them left out on the picnic table that were not disturbed in any way. Also, he could not visualize a bear grunting in such a way to have heard it 2 feet above the ceiling of his 6-1/2 ft tent from a distance of about 6-7 feet from the back wall of the tent.The witness described himself as a 51 year-old CPA professional and his companion as 48 years old.After analysis of the campground layout, the localized topography, and the witnesses account, I determined that in all likelihood, the witness and his girlfriend were visited by a large sasquatch at that location.",

I was with the stragglers, a few of whom were suffering from the cold and thin air. The trail had only been opened, as I recall, the previous day, and ours was the first group of the season to make the ascent. Lots of snow remained in shaded areas and in many places on the trail, and it was obvious no one had walked ahead of us, although a couple of older men on four wheelers passed us at one point. We were getting fairly close, within a half mile or so, to the lake; the slope was very steep. I remember our little group went past a switchback and we were uphill from a stream.",
