We had left our house, which sat atop a ridge and went down into our hollow.  We had planned to go down the creek about a mile to the next hollow, turn right up this hollow, follow it all the way up, and climb the hill back to the top of the ridge. We would then have an easy walk home on a gravel road, which was the main road in the area at that time. We were about three miles from the nearest blacktop road, which was WV RT2 running beside the Ohio River.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "In my conversation with Ron B. the first thing noticed was his attention to detail.    His accuracy in describing the native flora and fauna to me was very apparent. Here is a man who has spent a significant amount of time in the outdoors and it shows.  His familiarity with different species is superb.  He told me how frightened he was at the time of his incident.  He also related how he remembers the low rumble that could be compared with the low base vocalizations of elephants.The only North American species I am familiar with that does that (emits a base vocalization so low it can be felt)  is the male American Alligator (Alligator Mississippiensis) which obviously does not occur in West VA, on a hillside and is certainly not active in November (since it's ectothermic).  I suspect that some large bears may be capable of a low growl that, depending upon the size of the bear, may be similar.   Regarding the likelihood of a bear, that doesn't explain the scream call that Ron heard (or the dog's behavior patterns either).  He imitated it to me over the phone.  He is familiar with cougar and bobcat screams.This was actually intimidating and ended with a heeee heeee heeee sound.  Obviously whatever it was that Ron and his grandfather experienced that night did not want company.Additional notes will soon be added on this particular report.** Additional comments from Ron:   -  The sound rose up in pitch to a really high note.   -  It was a kind of a bellow that had to come from a really       large animal.  -  The area at the time of the experience may well have had     only he and his grandfather in it one time a year. -  His great uncle did not like the area as when he entered it;    the dogs acted very strangely.  This was so out of    character for them, he did not go there much if at all. - Regarding the possiblity of bear, no.  They feared nothing.   Except this. - The only other stories Ron had about the area was that    his grandfather's wife's father once heard a blood curdling    yell from down in the hollow.   - Back in the late 50's and early 60's those hills were    completely overgrown and had brush real thick so visibility   was impossible. - Back then there was no deer season, so there wasn't a     reason for lots of people to be tramping the woods. - Anything that screamed back then, like now, was attributed   to a panther scream.  It wasn't like anybody was going to    check it out.Ron is interested in hearing about anyone from the area who might have had similar experiences.  If you have had a sighting or experienced something that could be a sasquatch,  please contact the BFRO and fill out a report.  This will help us learn and share the behavior patterns, distribution and natural history of this incredible unknown primate.  We can post the information for all interested and still protect detailed information or individuals.It appears that this creature's pattern of distribution in West Virginia on the west side of the state has an association with the Ohio River, and Ron's experience was no exception.  This location was approximately 2.5 miles from the Ohio River system.  It was about 15 miles northeast of Huntington on Hwy 2.   Reports still come from these areas from along the Ohio River.",

            "Observed": "Was at a creek where I hung out almost every summer with my brothers and friends. Was probably sometime in July,1969. there was a huge tree about 300 ft. from a bridge that went across the creek. Myself and 2 younger brothers were on this bridge on our bikes. I saw something big in that tree 300 ft. away. I kept an eye on it, then I saw something same size as a full grown chimp. About 4 ft. tall, swinging from limb to limb and just playing in the tree. I told my brothers, look at that huge monkey!. We sat and watched it for 5 incredulous minutes. I could't believe my eyes. All of a sudden, I had this incredible over whelming sense of terror. Didn't see anything threatening; just felt terrified. I told my brothers we have to go and right now! I made them follow me and on the way up, my middle brother said go fast! There is a man chasing me. he was in the rear of us. We rode as fast as we could about a half mile home and he said it was a strange hairy man chasing us. I think it was a bigfoot protecting its young in the tree. It just chases us off. I didn't go back to that creek the rest of the summer. Scared me to death.",
