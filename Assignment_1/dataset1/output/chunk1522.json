            "Observed": "It was the middle of August & about lunch time. A friend of mine & I was heading south of Union town & decided to go to Ft. Scott for lunch. So we cut across on a gravel road. I was reading a Big Nickle (advertisment paper) and we were talking & going along when my friend suddenly seemed to quit talking in mid sentence. I looked up and saw somehting running upright manlike all hairy, about 5 feet tall but it was going so fast it was to the trees & gone by the time my eyes had focused. My friend (who was driving) says \"did you see that?\". I said was it about 5 feet tall & reddish haired. He said \"it looked at me\". I said what was it, you saw it better than me, I just looked up. He wouldn't say it but it was a Bigfoot. It ran very quickly across the road. Otherwise I would have always thought it might be a prank but it ran way faster than I could. It was about 1 block ahead of us when it crossed the road. It was on the east side of a creek & we were just coming to a low water bridge. It was very windy that day. As we drove past the place it went into the woods I looked but saw nothing more and I could see 3-400 yards up a grade to a ridge. As it ran across a small group of birds flew up out of the ditch as it ran into the woods.",
