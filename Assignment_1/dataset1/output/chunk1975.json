We were on route 32 in Illinois, just north of the Shumway turnoff by about a mile or so, when a large bi-ped appearing around 9' tall, came running out of a cornfield, crossed a ditch as if it weren't there and crossed the highway in three steps then over another ditch into another cornfield. It appeared to be greyish in color and ran with its arms down in a pendulum type motion. It was approximately 30 yards ahead of us. We both turn to each other at the same time and said, \"Did you see that?\" We slowed down, but it was too dark to see much. We returned late in the afternoon the next day to look for signs, but the area farmers had harvested the corn on both sides of the roads earlier that morning.",

The sound literally gave me cold chills and made the hair stand up on my neck. Then there was a clearing in the trees and saw a dark figure walking around in the creek lit by the moonlight. I was really scared of moving and after a few minutes, I lost it in the trees. Then I got up and went back inside.",
