            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness said when first seen it walked to and fro on the road, crossing it several times as if it was looking for something.  .When it noticed him it left by leaping and clearing a twelve foot expanse of water and then moving effortlessly into a bog.  This creature went right through difficult ground. Its coloration was reddish brown.  Other things noticed were that it had no hair on its hands.  The skin was dark gray.  He said it was built like a large man and had \"man height\".  Specific features were not noticeable and it seemed very dark at the distance he watched it from. There is approximately 1500 to 2000 acres of swampland in that area that has little or no development.  The habitat is  substantial.The reason that the witness did not shoot was he was concerned it was a man in a monkey suit.  He tossed that idea aside after he watched its catlike agility.  He thought if it was a man in a monkey suit it would be a very energetic person, but he ruled it out after he saw the ground it covered and the length of its jump.  It covered ground in the bog very quickly which he felt also ruled out a person.  ",
