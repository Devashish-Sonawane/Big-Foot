            "Observed": "At around 11pm on July 26th my wife and I we're night fishing on the backwater of cranesnest river in Dickinson county Virginia. My wife's head was hurting so she decided to take a nap we had heard something large walking in the woods but wrote it off as a bear or deer as both are plentiful in our area. She had been asleep for about an hour when I heard a large knock about 50 yards up in the tree line then about 15 to 20 seconds later several hundred yards up the ridge there was another knock. Both sounded as if someone had taken a 4x4 post and struck a tree with it. Then about 10 min later there was a splash in the water about 20 feet away from our boat. This splash sounded like something weighing 20 or 30 lbs had struck the water waking my wife. It's not unusual to hear large fish jumping at night but this was different after the splash no more than a couple minutes had passed and there was 2 more knocks. And they were closer than the first one.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness. He's a 47 year old carpenter. He sounds very credible. This is a location to check out soon if you have a boat and a thermal imager. On Google Maps, Cranesnest River Road appears to terminate at a distance from the river. The witness says it is now blocked off where it bends away from the river, so the incident did occur approximately across the river from where it ends now. He described more than one tell-tale Class B incident along that portion of river, including near the cove where Neel Branch meets the river. Here is the map pin for where he and his wife heard knocks, etc., two nights ago: Click here. For discussion on this report see official BFRO Facebook group.",

It's more than 700 feet to where we need to take our garbage so the garbage company will pick it up.  At that time we had a vapor light that gave enough light to see to the top of our short driveway.  Once they got to the top of the hill, they couldn't see a thing because it was so dark outside.  As they were walking together (carrying the can), they heard loud footsteps following them in the nearby bushes.  When they would stop, it would stop and take one more step.  They started up again and it started up walking beside them making very loud crunching steps.  They stopped again and it would stop by taking one more step than they did. My husband called \"George is that you?\u0094 thinking it was our neighbor, but got no answer. They then decided to put the can down and run for home!",
