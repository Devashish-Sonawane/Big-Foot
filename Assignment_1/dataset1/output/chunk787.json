At the time, the witness was going to college in Humboldt, training to be a police officer. I have talked with several people over the years who have had sightings and auditory encounters in the immediate vicinity.The description of the odor was consistent with other sasquatch reports. According to the witness, all of the trees were on his right when heading East. Two were directly next to each other and the other was approximately 15 feet further down. In hindsight the witness wishes they had looked for more sign, tracks and so forth.",
