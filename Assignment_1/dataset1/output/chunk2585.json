I happened to glance up to the right of the road and couldn`t believe what I saw. A very large reddish brown animal was walking upright about 125 yards from the side of the road. It was very large. I don`t know exactly how big or how much it could have weighed but I do know the hands of the animal hung to about the tops of the fence posts it was walking next to. Those posts are about three to four feet of exposed post There were two of us who saw the creature walking.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On August 20, 2001, I called Danny B. who was the driver of the van, when he and one other passenger observed this animal walking, in 1999. Because this was a sighting, I asked Danny the following questions:*Where did this incident occur?  \u201cWe were east bound on U.S. Highway 90, between Livingston and Bozeman, Montana.\u201d*What date did this take place?  \u201cDuring the summer of 1999.\u201d*Do you remember the month? \u201cI think it was in July.\u201d*Was it day or night?  \u201cEarly morning about 7:30 AM.\u201d*Describe the area in which this incident occurred. \u201cIt was walking toward us on the south side of the Highway in a rolling foot hill area. It was a low brush area.\u201d*Where about in Montana did this happen?  \u201cOn the south side of U.S. 90, about twelve miles east of Bozeman MT.\u201d*Near what area? \u201cI believe it was in the Bozeman pass area.\u201d*What distance would you estimate you were from this thing when you first saw it? \u201cThe animal was about 100 to 150 yards from us, heading in a westerly direction.\u201d*What was your first reaction?  \u201cI did a double take, because what I was seeing was so out of place.\u201d*What was it doing? \u201cIt, the animal, was walking towards us down a fence line, and it was taking very long strides.\u201d*Were you alone when you first saw this? \u201cNo, there were several of us in the van, but only two of us were awake.  The other eye witness was in the passenger set, and he seen it first, and his first words were, \u201cDid you see that?\u201d*What's is his/her name? \u201cHis first name is Brian, and he said it looked like a Chewbacca.\u201d*Did it stand and walk on two legs?  \u201cYes, that\u2019s all I seen it do, was walking very fast with giant strides, and its arms swayed in a rhythmic manner.\u201d*Did you see it go down on all fours? \u201cNo!\u201d*Was it covered in hair?  \u201cDefinitely.\u201d*What color was it?  \u201cIt looked reddish brown, and it stood out from the back ground because the back ground was a light tan color.\u201d*How tall would you estimate this thing to have been? \u201cIt was between eight feet and nine feet tall. I was using the fence as a guide.\u201d*What would you estimate its weight to have been?  \u201cIt looked to be about four to six hundred pounds, but I am only estimating.\u201d*Did you see any facial features?  \u201cNo, the main thing that I noticed was, its head and upper body seemed to be one, like it had no neck.  And, I noticed the arm and leg movements as it walked.\u201d *Could you describe any facial features?   \u201cNo, because I was not that close to observe such things.\u201d\t*Did you observe any ears?  \u201cNo, ears observed.\u201d*Could you describe the arms?  \u201cThey seemed long, I was judging them against the fence posts.  I remember that the top of the hands were at the top of the fence posts.\u201d *Could you tell if it was a male or a female? \u201cI could not discern its sex at that distance.\u201d *About for how long did you see it?  \u201cOnly about five to seven seconds.\u201d*Did it ever make any noise? \u201cNo, we were moving down the road at about seventy miles an hour.\u201d *Did it ever make any animal sounds from its mouth? \u201cAgain, no.\u201d*Did it see you?  \u201cI don\u2019t think so, it seemed not to be concerned with us or anybody else that was on that highway.\u201d     \t\t\t\t*Did you smell anything? \u201cWe were moving too fast to smell anything.\u201d*Did you check for footprints? \u201cWe never stopped or went back.  But, I now wish we had gone back, or at least stop and watch it a little longer.\u201d*Did you report what you saw?  (i.e.) Like your parents or any agency?  \u201cNo to that answer, but I did tell some friends.\u201d*What was their response? \u201cThey just though that I was crazy.\u201d*In your own words describe what happened.  \u201cWe were just driving east bound on Highway 90, about twelve miles out of Bozeman Mt., and we observed this animal walking towards us along a fence line, about one hundred and twenty five yards out.  I have never seen anything like it before or since.\u201dIn Summary:  Dan still seemed very excited about his sighting in Montana in 1999. Since this sighting, Dan has moved to Portland Oregon, and he now takes short expeditions into the Gifford Pinchot N.F. in Washington, to look for this mystical creature.  This short sighting encounter with a possible bigfoot, has made a large change in Dan\u2019s life.  After talking with Dan, I believe that he has seen a bigfoot creature, on that early morning drive between Bozeman and Livingston, Montana.",
