            "Observed.1  ": "\u0093For every sighting we have heard about, there's probably 10 more that we don't hear about,\u0094 said Olson, who spoke this past week about northeastern Minnesota Bigfoot sightings at Lady Ocalat's Emporium in downtown Duluth, a shop that sells \u0093eclectic and magical\u0094 items. \u0093One of the ideas is that these creatures are moving east away from what could be a cataclysmic disaster,\u0094 Olson said. Signs, reports Olson is one of a handful of northeastern Minnesota Bigfoot researchers who say they've seen signs - or received reports - of Bigfoot \u0093beings,\u0094 also known as Sasquatch, across northeastern Minnesota. Within the past two years, there have been about 20 documented sightings across northeastern Minnesota, Olson said. The creatures have been described as having human-like faces with cone-shaped heads, hairy, stooped, with long arms and palms that face backward. \u0093And they can run,\u0094 said Olson. \u0093There's probably no animal in Minnesota that could catch them.\u0094 Sites of sightingsMany of the reported sightings have been in rural areas surrounding Leech Lake, some in the day and some at night. But sightings have also been reported in other areas. \u0093We've had actual sightings near Bovey, Nett Lake and around here,\u0094 said Donald Sherman, a facilities manager at Cass Lake Hospital and a member of the Leech Lake Ojibwe band. He documents Bigfoot sightings and stories in the region. \u0093They have like a human footprint, but the prints are extremely large. We have photographs where they have made shelters, where there's animal bones lying around the shelters.\u0094 Indian beliefsStories of Bigfoot - a large brown, hairy human-like being that roams forests - go back hundreds of years in American Indian beliefs, Sherman said. In Ojibwe, the word for a Bigfoot-like creature is \u0093bugwayjinini,\u0094 meaning \u0093wild man,\u0094 Sherman said. Indians believe that Bigfoot beings were sent by the creator long ago to guide and care for Indian people and give warnings, particularly of impending sickness, Sherman said. \u0093It's how we learn medicine,\u0094 Sherman said. \u0093Bigfoot teaches us medicine through our medicine man.\u0094 Sherman believes 300 to 400 - perhaps even 500 - Bigfoot exist in Minnesota. \u0093A man was hunting during the day in Nett Lake (about 20 years ago) and thought he saw a bear,\u0094 Sherman said. \u0093He put his 30.06 scope on it, but then, it stood up on two legs. It looked like a human, and he couldn't shoot it. Then, it just took off.\u0094 In 2005, a woman reported seeing a Bigfoot near Bena, Sherman said. \u0093She was driving her car and saw it walking near some railroad tracks,\u0094 Sherman said. \u0093She said it looked right at her and she started crying. She said it looked into her soul.\u0094 In 2006, a woman driving at night reported a sighting near Ball Club. \u0093She had come from the Deer River Casino and a small one came out, saw her and went back into the swamp,\u0094 Sherman said. \u0093Nobody knows if they're human or animal. Some Native Americans say they can change themselves and go into a different dimension and disappear right in front of you. . . . There's a lot more people seeing them in the last two years, or else more people are starting to come out of the woods who are willing to talk about what they've seen.\u0094 No evidenceThere's never been any evidence to support believers' claims, said Keith Matson of Deer River, a retired U.S. Forest Service inventory technician who worked in northeastern Minnesota forests for 28 years and knows Olson. \u0093I have had contact with a lot of professionals who work in the forest and they have never seen signs,\u0094 Matson said. \u0093Unfortunately, [Bigfoot] tracks are easy to fake. I'm not doubting their sincerity, but did they really see Bigfoot or did they see a bear or a moose, or is it a repressed dream? Footprints foundJody Hansen of Keewatin said he's been researching the existence of Bigfoot in northeastern Minnesota since June. This summer, Hansen said he found a footprint 17 inches long, 5 inches across the heel and 8 inches across the toes in an anthill near Carey Lake east of Hibbing. He said he's also found piles of branches and stick figures created by Bigfoot for communication. Hansen and Olsen said Bigfoot also communicate by knocking on trees. Sherman says he and other Bigfoot researchers know there will always be doubters. \u0093There's always skeptics,\u0094 Sherman said. \u0093But it's like bears - there are a lot of them around, but not too many people have seen them. It's like people who don't believe in God.\u0094",
