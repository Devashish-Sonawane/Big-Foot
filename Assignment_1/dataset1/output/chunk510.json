            "Observed": "My friend and I were backpacking in the Redwood National Park, north of Eureka, on [a particular trail in the National Park]. We started hiking at about 3 in the afternoon, and hiked for a few hours. Then we walked off the trail up into a small canyon for about half a mile and made camp. Found bear tracks, started to get worried, so we hung our food from a tree. About this time (7 o'clock) we heard the first scream. It was short, and didn't repeat. We started to get a little freaked out, so we started a fire, and heard nothing for the next 3 or 4 hours. Then at about 10:30 11:00 p.m. the screaming started again, this time lasting for about 10 minutes. It sounded like it was about half a mile away on one of the surrounding ridges, a very eerie wail.  It didn't sound human.  I know what elk, coyote, and wolf calls sound like, and this was nowhere near... very similar to recordings I have heard of supposed bigfoot calls.  We went to bed at about 2 a.m., and left the next morning without incident.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "In an online interview, the witness added the following details:Each vocalization lasted about 3-5 seconds, and was similar to the Ohio Howl found on the BFRO website. The first vocalization was a short scream sound, nearby, which occured as they arrived at camp location and started to set up. The howls began later, at an estimated 400-500 meters, and were reported to be rhythmic; repeating over and over again for possibly 5 minutes. On a second trip to the area, the same howling sound was heard, but at a greater distance; possibly more than a mile away. This series also repeated for about 5 minutes. Attempts to record the sound on the second trip failed due to inadequate recording equipment. The initial scream was heard around 19:00, the howls began at 22:30. On the second trip, the howls began at about 23:00. Witness states that they thought only one animal was involved each time, as there was no other calls from any other direction in response to what they heard. When asked about wood knocks, the witness was not aware of the phenomenon, and stated that they possibly did hear wood knocks along with branches breaking or falling; but thought they were natural forest sounds. Note: He also mentioned that the air was still and quiet at the time of the vocalizations.",
