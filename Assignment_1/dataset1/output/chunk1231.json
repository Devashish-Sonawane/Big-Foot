            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness I can add the following information:During one evening of a camping trip in the Fall of 1995, members of the group had played a game of capture the flag, in full darkness. A small group of people did not make it back to camp so the witness joined in an impromptu search party that went out to look for them. After locating them a half mile or so upstream from camp, and up on a ridge, the members collected together and began making their way down stream toward camp.At this point large rocks began dropping into the stream behind them, as if being thrown from the hill side above. They could also hear the the sounds of movement on the hill above, rapid footsteps and shuffling in the brush. They thought it could be a bear, or possibly a hunter. Unnerved they moved quickly downstream through the dark toward camp. Occasionally they would stop and listen, and hear the movement on the hill above keeping pace with their travel. If they continued to hold their position more rocks would eventually come down from above, bouncing off trees.It took 20 minutes to travel back to camp. As they finally drew close and could hear the sounds of their camp, animal-like vocalizations began on the hill above them. But as they progressed toward camp these vocalizations seemed to back away to a greater distance.The witness did not think any more of the incidents until years later when a friend of his, with an interest in bigfoot, described harassment behavior. This brought back the memory of those nights and caused the witness to become curious, leading him eventually to the BFRO.  The expedition and harassment behavior referred to occurred at the BFRO West Virginia Expedition.It is interesting to note that while this incident occurred in the mid-90's, a wood knocking incident described in report 28449 occurred very near this location, in Fall 2010.",
