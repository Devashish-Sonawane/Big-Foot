            "Observed": "I was traveling down Highway 61 between Canady and Givehans headed East at ten minutes after eight in the morning. I saw what I perceived as a man walking up to the side of the road. The sun was up high enough that I had put the visor back into normal position, but it back lit the man so all I could see was a silhouette. I assumed it was a man going to cross the road to a mail box. He was far enough ahead that I did not take my foot of the gas peddle, but watched him cross the road. As I approached I was concerned he may step back into the road without looking so I let off the gas and looked for him. He was gone! There was no mail box, no man, not even a house. Both sides of the road were thick woods. I slowed way down to look for him but I could not find hide nor hair of any one. He was no where to be found.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was interviewed by phone just a few days after his sighting. A field investigation to the area was conducted with 3 BFRO investigators one week after the sighting.-The area in which the sighting occurred is relatively rural, with farms and houses dotted along the highway.There is also a sand mine in operation about a mile or so away.-The Edisto River is just north and parallel to the sighting area.The highway crosses the river a few miles away as it meanders south and and there are numerous swamps and wetland areas in and around the river and the sighting area.-The point at which the sasquatch crossed the road in front of the witness is heavily wooded. On the south side of the road there is an embankment which leads to a path through the woods and eventually part of a farm.-On the north side of the road there is another embankment that leads into a heavily wooded swampy area.There is also standing water at the bottom of the embankment which is part of the wetlands/swamp.- He did not see any facial features.-The figure walked from one side of the road clear to the other side in 4 strides, moving at a steady pace, but in no way was the animal in a hurry.-The witness was on route to an appointment and was short on time. He returned in the early afternoon and spent some time at the site looking for tracks or any other evidence.",

I was looking to see what the parking situation was there for a future hike so my eyes were on the right side of the road when out of the periphery I saw what I thought was a ground hog on the left. It was very large and I realized that it would have to be a huge ground hog so I looked fully to the left and I saw an approximate 3 to 3.5' tall creature stand up on two legs as I passed by. I did not get a good look at the face and I almost continued but I decided to turn around about 150 yards up on a dirt road that's on the right.",
