My sister in law's grandmother lived in Buttonwillow which is in Kern County, and my grandmother lived in Porterville, which is in Tulare County. It had just grown dark by the time we were about five miles outside of Paso Robles still in San Luis Obispo County on Highway 46 heading toward Shandon, and had just passed a lone farmhouse to our left when I had to pull to a quick stop. Just in front of us stooped down in the road and holding a chicken to its mouth was a creature about the size of a 12 year old. It stood up on two legs and ran quickly past us to the left of my vehicle, still holding the chicken. We turned to watch it veer off to our right behind us and up over an embankment. I asked my sister in law, \"Did you see that?\" She did.",
