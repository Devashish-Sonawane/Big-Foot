Turned on overhead light in living room, was standing behind recliner waiting for my wife to remove her coat and put it in the hall closet. The windows to the south, saw an upright creature walk past the window on the deck attached to the house.  Could not determine the height, was poor visibility.  Creature was sandy brown in color, had short, very clean wavy hair.  Waves were in verticle appearance, not horizontal.  Over the years, we have heard vocalization and loud bangs (only one at a time).  This activity occurs in the months of October/November.  I do not believe that they reside here, I think they are moving south for the winter.  Our house is on a high promenade high above a valley.  This seems to be a runway for all animals.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I had the pleasure to interview George, a lively 82-year old who is anything but retired.  He and his wife live atop a tall hill which has a deep valley on two sides.  On November 2 they had just returned home from dinner, and had parked in the garage.  After parking George walked through the adjoining hallway from the garage to the house, put away a doggie bag, walked over to a chair, and looked out a double window.  His wife was in the hallway hanging up her coat.  George turned on a lamp and observed a figure on the deck slowly walk past the window.  All that was visible was from the shoulders down to the hips - no head was visible.  \"The hair was smooth, like a dog,\" and not fluffy like fur.  George stated, \"It was wavy like a 1920's woman's hairdo, and maybe an inch long, and it was brown in color.\"  The figure moved from left to right so all that was visible was the right side of the body.  George waited for \"maybe ten seconds\" before turning on the porch light, but by then it was gone.  He was positive it wasn't his wife's reflection in the window because he would have been blocking it.George went on to describe other instances over the past five years, including vocalizations (long moan-like howls and he mimicked a howl for me - \"Put your hands on each side of your mouth and yell AHHHHH!\") in the fall, the house being slapped or hit late at night and early in the morning. And on only one occasion while relaxing in the hot tub on the deck late one night he was overcome with the feeling of horrible fright and that he had better run.  Tree Knocks were heard on November 1 and November 2 as well. As of the census of 2000, there were 22,780 people residing in the county. The population density was 30 people per square mile (12/km\u00b2). The natural vegetation is mostly oak savanna, with a belt of prairie bluestem and composites across the center, and into the southeast and south-central areas of the county.  The area of the sighting is part of the Wisconsin River watershed and is in the northwest corner of the county. There are also a lot of caves in the general area. ",
