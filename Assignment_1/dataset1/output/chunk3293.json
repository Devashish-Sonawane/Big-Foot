One of the many incident reports came from almost the exact locationand sounded so similar to his experience, S.H. felt compelled to share his story. Please see related report # 3202 \"Nighttime sighting by family on hwy 12 near Packwood Labor Day weekend. I found this witness to be very credible. He was not eager to have his name out there to be considered crazy. The reason for not reporting for so many years.A truck driver broke down in the same area (mid 1990's). The driver had a large animal watching him from a distance. The animal was described as dark black and covered with hair. It moved back and forth between the trees as if hiding, but too curious to stay hidden. The truck driver got a good look at it in the moon light. This was a second hand story from the drivers employer who rescued him that night. The employer knew the guy well and never saw anyone more scared and eager to get out of there.Another story from the same general area, had a motorist slamming on the breaks then swerving to miss a large hairy animal in the road squatting down. It rose as the car approached and quickly got out of the way on two legs, swinging it long arms. The driver returned to find a large wet spot were the animal had been. The incident was in the late 1980's. I don't have much more information about either of these sightings. This report was also in the early morning hours.Both were second hand stories told to this investigator.",
