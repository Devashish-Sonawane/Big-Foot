            "Observed": "We were walking down the road enjoying our summer vacation.  When one of us noticed that there was something walking in the pasture North of where we were standing.  It was close to 7 feet tall, had long white hair (at least a foot), was walking on two legs.  It stopped when it noticed us standing there watching it.  Actually we were almost too scared to run.  Anyway it acted like it was going to come our way so we took off for a little ways then stopped to look again.  Everyone knows that a fence with 6 strands of barbed wire is at least 5 feet tall right.  Well, it stepped over that like it wasn't there and kept on going to the East taking long strides and swinging its arms back and forth while it walked.  A few days later we were in the same general area and noticed some long white hair hooked on the top wire of the fence.  We took it home to prove our story we told the day before.  We called it a Honka.  Have to say that we were more careful about how late we stayed out from that day on.  Always made sure we were home before dark.  Until the moment we saw it we had heard lots of stories but never believed them.  Seeing is believing.",

            "Other Stories": "yes, lots of people talked about the Honka.  I was probably 10 years old.  I had taken a peanutbutter and jelly sandwich into the pasture to have a picnic lunch by a small pool of water that was surrounded by tress.  It was very quiet and I liked the peacefulness that I always seemed to get when I went up there.  I had just set down to enjoy my sandwich and koolaid when I heard something walking in the trees behind me.  I listened for a moment and knowing there were no cows on our property the hair on my arms started to stand up.  The foot steps were getting closer and there was a smell in the air that I could never describe again.  I left my lunch and ran toward the house.  As I was running away I could still hear the footsteps behind me.  I returned a few days later with a friend to retrieve my jar.  It was shattered and the bag my lunch was in was shredded.  I never went that far into the pasture again by myself.  The memory is still so vivid that it is almost as if it happend yesterday.  My father told me stories after that of some strange encounters in his younger days while he was coon hunting.  Our property was at the base of a mountain.  There is a lot of trees on it.  A creek that runs through it also.  Now that I think back I can understand more about what I heard.  It was definately a two legged animal of some kind.",

She recalled that the creature she saw was a \"dirty white.\" She said she and her nephew must have watched it for several minutes, before the animal turned to walk toward them. At that time, the two children were overcome with fear and hurriedly left the scene. Upon arriving home, the witness told her parents what she and her nephew saw. Even though her father had told her before of \"the honka,\" the witness's parents still did not take the children seriously. Even after the children found the hair and showed it to the adults, the adults dismissed it as horse hair. The witness told me that the visual encounter made \"quite an impression\" on her. ",

            "Observed": "At the time, I lived in Umatilla, Florida.I used to work on CB radios and such and occasinally a deputy would stop by my little shop at my house and we would shoot the bull. One nite a deputy stopped and said they had a Bigfoot sighting in the Ocala National forest, and being the curious type, I asked where and he told me. The next morning 6/30/1980, I got a friend of mine and decided to go and see if we could find the prints. We stopped at the hardware store and I bought, some plaster of paris. Already had the buckets in the Jeep. When we arrived we could see where casts had previously been taken, we decided to look further. So, we drove further thru the woods and had to cross a pretty deep creek to get to the other side, where the road continued, if you want to call it a road. I stopped the jeep and we got out to look around and LOW AND BEHOLD, there were prints coming from a clear cut area (where trees have been cut down and removed), across the sandy road and leading into the swamp. It had stopped at the edge of the road and must have eaten bay tree blossoms because up about 10 to 12 feet in the tree you could see where it took the blossoms and there were pieces of the blossoms on the ground. The prints were about 4 to 5 feet apart when it walked, and about 1 to 2 inches deep. As I walked or tried to walk in its stride, it was a stretch for me as I'm a pretty big man myself, 6ft.3in. I actually put my foot in its prints as i walked deeper into the swamp. The further I got the deeper the prints went into the ground and my foot and leg went all the way to my groin area, this thing was BIG. I took 2 casts and gave one to my buddy and I kept one, which I still have.There is NO DOUBT IN MY MIND after seeing what I saw and casting the prints that this DOES EXIST.",
