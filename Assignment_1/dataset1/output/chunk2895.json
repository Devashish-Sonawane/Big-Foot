            "Observed": "In early to mid October of 1981 I was 17 years old. I was working weekends in Fayetteville, a town 28 miles from where I lived in Siloam Springs. I usualy left for work around 5:30am.I would drive the old highway #68 towards Fayetteville-Springdale. One morning I was on my way to work and as I was coming close to where Fairmount road was I could see something by the bridge at first I thought it was a coyote or large dog scratching around the bridge with its back legs as I got closer I realized it was not and that it was a sasquatch, it was a reddish-brown color, I could see its face area had almost no hair and the skin tone was lighter than the rest of it. It looked up at me as I passed on over the bridge, my car was a vw bug and the lights were not very bright, it seemed to be startled. I lokked into the rearview mirror to see it jump up and run across the road. It moved in long strides and very quickly. It was tall maybe close to 7 feet and was thinner than I would have expected it to be. The activity it seemed to be doing when I first saw it was digging at the ground next to the bridge the motion it was using was similar to what primates do, the manner in which it moved across the road was however more like a human would move.",
