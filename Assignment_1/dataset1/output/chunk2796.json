            "Observed": "Ok, I feel as if I need to qualify this statement. First of all, it was the discovery of this website and report submission form which inspired me to come forward and reveal my sighting incident. I have held off for over four years for fear of accusations of incompetence and lunacy-- after all, who doesn't poke fun at the \"freaks\" who tell of UFO and Bigfoot incidents? Second, I will confidently say that this sighting is absolutely true, and I will continue to have vivid memories of it all of my life. Third, I am a highly reputable source: I am a licensed English Teacher currently working at a large public high school in Oregon. I am educated, am of sound mind, and am not wasting my efforts here on a hoax of any sort. Finally, my most accurate narrative memory of my sighting: at the time of my sighting (see above for details), I was alone in a two bedroom residence located approx. 1/4 mile north of US Hwy. 199, on a gradual wooded slope. On this three-acre property, there are two horse pastures--one below the house and one above the house. Both pastures are surrounded by active hot- wire fences and contain two horses which may move freely between both lower and upper pastures.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "L.P. has taught 10th grade History and English at a public high school in Oregon for the last two years. He has just changed careers and is now a police officer for a metropolitan police agency in Oregon. He has a Bachelor's degree and is nearly finished with a Master's degree from the Univ. of Oregon. He was a highly decorated military police officer in the US Army. He is an intelligent man with above-average observation skills. L.P.'s recollection of the property and landscape in Wilderville are very consistent with that area. There are several small farms and houses in that area of Hwy 199 and most of these parcels have horses and other livestock. Although his observations of the creature were limited in detail, due to the fogginess and reflection of his flashlight, L.P. is absolutely positive that the creature moved on two legs and was tall. L.P. is 6'4\" and estimates that the creature was quite a bit taller. He does not recall any particular smell associated with the creature. I found this witness to be truthful and credible. Witness is receptive to further interviews by members of the BFRO.",

A dog returned home from fighting with something that had torn him with cuts pretty badly. A dog was found dead in his wire pen enclosure, and an impression of a large animal having \"caved\" in the wire. The dog had no marks on him and seemed to die of fright. One early morning hour last fall I was awakened by something pounding on the wood siding of my house, almost like an open hand or fist was smashed into it. Also, I was awakened in the late summer or early fall of 2008, with something very large (it sounded like a man walking) on the metal roof of my house and when \"he\" leaped off it seemed that he didn't clear the edge and slipped nearer to my window which was on that end of the house. Very nearly scared me to death! I live in a modified A-Frame house, this was on a room addition which juts out toward a heavily wooded hillside.

            "Observed": "Just two nights ago,( 2/16/09) my brother who lives up the hollow from my house called a little after 8 p.m. to say he had seen something outside in his yard. It seemed to be turned in the direction of his chicken house, at an angle to him, where it could keep a lookout both toward his house and the driveway which passes on up further into the hollow where there is another house. I have another brother that lives right across the driveway from the first brother. This brother says that two nights (2/14/09) before my brother saw what he did, he thought he saw something standing at the end of my 1st brother's screened in porch, my second brother was smoking on his screened in porch, and when he opened his screen door to get a better look, my 1st brother's pole light (which has a short in it) went out, and he couldn't see anything at all in that direction then. A few years ago, a third brother and neighbor to these other brothers, was walking in the dark without a light to my 2nd brother's house, and something screamed like a woman at him, and terrified him. This is a man standing 6' tall and over 300 lbs. My 1st brother is also 6' tall and over 300 lbs, and the creature he saw was taller and weighed more than he did. But he said it didn't seem to be fat. It had reddish brown fur-hair. He did not see the facial features due to the profile stance the creature was in and he said that it seemed to be aware that it, my brother yelled out loud, \"What the heck is that!\" and ran toward his front door that opens to his screened porch, he said that he felt the creature heard him and knew it had been observed and when he went to the front door and stepped out on the screened in porch, it was gone. The dogs didn't show up until my brother yelled for them. I myself have had a couple of things happen to me, that at the time they happened were unexplained but now I wonder if they are not related. Last fall my daughter and myself were leaving her house, she lives at the bottom of my hill near the creek, when something that screamed like a women terrified us. Then I heard what sounded like someone hit the side of my house under the breezeway where my bedroom is located, and I have had what sounded to me like a man walking across my house again over where my bedroom is located and in a minute or two it retraced its steps. I was very frightened to say the least!",

I have advised them to keep in touch with me should anything else happen.  Plans to more thoroughly investigate this area are in the works. ",
