            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness in a telephone interview and found him to be very credible. He said that he had recently spoken to his friend about their sighting and that both of them recalled the same details. He said his friend hasn't spoken to anyone about the sighting, fearing that no one would believe him. The witness told me that to this day he is still amazed by what they saw, and believes that the creature had been at the pond the entire time they had been fishing.  According to the witness, they had been fishing for about half an hour to an hour and never heard anything that would lead them to believe that any kind of animal had approached them.  The witness said \"I can't even tell you what possessed us to go fishing in the dead of winter. There was snow on the ground, and here we were fishing and then I notice something stand up!\"   The witness said the creature was tall, large, and had a lot of dark brown hair. The witness said it stood up and walked up the side of a steep hill. At the top of the hill it turned its body to look back at them and then left. Consequently, the witness left as well.  This county, as well as the surrounding area, has a long history of sasquatch sightings.",
