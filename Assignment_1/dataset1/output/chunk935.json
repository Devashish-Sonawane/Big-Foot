I have contacted the reporter covering the story, Andrew Haworth, and the witnesses, Jackie and David Hutto. Andrew is covering the report sincerely, and responsibly. Jackie and David seem very sincere, and egar to answer questions, offering details that they are not prompted for. When they first reported the story, they told the reporter that Jackie was a 23 year old woman, apparently in an attempt to remain anonymous, but on further consideration, they decided to be truthful about all facets of their encounter. They want others to feel that they can contact the authorities if they have seen something, and want people to know that they feel bigfoot isn't dangerous. ",
