            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted MS by phone stating that I wanted to go to this area and check it out. He tried to give me better directions. He also wanted to go along but couldn't get away right then.I traveled to the area on 10-26-02 at 9:30AM. I arrived at the turn off to go up to Big Hill at 2:30PM (FR 5900). The Entiat river valley is very picturesque! I saw a large doe cross the road in front of me in broad daylight. The river is level with the ground with a lot of sandy banks.I found the exact locations MS wrote about. The lower road is 5901, the upper is 5902. The roads are covered in 1/8\" of very fine reddish brown dust. Anything walking on it left tracks. I saw at least 500 deer tracks there. The elevation of 5901 and Silver Creek is 3780' (N47deg 48.224 / W -120 deg 31.897). I walked around quite a bit but heard nor saw anything except for a rapid series of gun shots lower down and at least 2 miles distant.I could not locate the tree with the missing patch of bark or the willows with stacked logs amongst them, but that doesn't mean anything. The area is very steep.He stated that the scat samples he found were from 1.25\" to 2.25\" in diameter and had white marbled looking flecks through-out. There was nothing but fine grained material in them otherwise.He also doesn't think he smelled or heard anything.",
