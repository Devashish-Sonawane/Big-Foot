            "Also Noticed": "A few days after that incident, the property owner stopped my buddy and I and asked why we had torn up the flood fence that crossed the creek at his property line? We told him that we didn't do any such thing and that the water was cold and over waist deep at that location. He still blamed us. We told him that the fence was not mangled and torn when we were there. That really made us wonder because whatever the being was, it had come back on the same path and and tore up the fence in just a couple of days.",

We were several hundred yards from it and I remember all three of us shooting BB guns at it. I do remember that it did not even turn to look at us. We got home, told my parents, and got in trouble. They said we were shooting at a hobo. (That wasn't a hobo but my dad said there weren't any monsters) 1972",

            "Observed": "Seen big dark something twice. I grew up on the eastside of Weatherford, born and raised on town creek, which stretched from Sunshine lake thru Weatherford all the way to Annetta South. During the winter, I trapped and hunted fur bearing animals. One nite on weekend, I was walking the creek hunting coons and came upon a part of creek where we all swam during the summers and remember a horrible foul odor that would take your breath. I was shining my light in the trees looking for eyes and heard what sounded like someone fall in the water. But by the time we got to where the noise came from, there was nothing. Only thing was  the water was disturbed and kind of murky. I was 12 years old at that time and didn't think too much about it at that time. Now I think back to that time and one other incident and I know what it was.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by telephone. He said that he had 2 or 3 encounters when he was a boy. The first occurred when he was 6 or 7 in 1971 or 1972. He and two other boys saw a large hairy biped step over a 5 strand barbed wire fence, walk over railroad tracks, and disappear on the other side as he and the other boys shot at it with bb guns. He said that it was reddish brown in color and did not look back at them. Five years later while coon hunting at night with a friend, the boys heard something very large fall in the creek. In two steps, whatever it was, made it across the creek. Another time while camped on the creek, the witness and a friend experienced a rotten mud smell and heard large rocks being thrown in the creek. They also heard growls and a grunt that frightened them, and they left. Other incidents included a tree that they found that had been uprooted and planted upside down. A rancher friend reported calves missing and a cow killed and its intestines pulled out.These incidents occurred in an area that has now become a suburb of a city on the outskirts of the Fort Worth/Dallas Metroplex. I have investigated several historical and recent encounters in this area, but due to the fact that nearly all of the land is privately owned, permission to do night investigations on site have not been obtained.I found the witness to be very sincere and lucid about his experiences. I found him to be a credible witness.",
