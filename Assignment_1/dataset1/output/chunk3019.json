            "Follow-Up Report": "This report came in as an email from the contact@BFRO.net line.  I was interested in this story because it comes from the area where I went to college as well as where I did my student teaching and had my first coaching job.  Further, I have been doing a great deal of research in central Michigan including the counties of Isabella, Mecosta, and Gladwin.  Gratiot County has some impressive river systems running through it.  The sources of the Saginaw River, which flows into Saginaw Bay, as well as the Pine and Maple Rivers, act as a travel route for all types of animals as the banks of these rivers are more forested than the surrounding land.  This is particularly true of the Maple River State Game area to the southwest and the Gratiot-Saginaw State Game Area to the west of the county which is near to where the incidents related below occurred. I emailed Ms. M in response to her contact.  I wanted to encourage her to submit a report that we could use to further our research.  I knew that she was concerned about privacy even though she no longer lives in the area. I introduced myself and she provided her phone number so that we could discuss what she had experienced.  Normally when I am conducting research on a phone I ask a lot of questions\u0097on this day, I listened.  I was fascinated with the stories that I was being told.  I was immediately struck by the manner in which Ms. M was speaking. We spoke for over an hour.While many people might be most interested in the sighting, I was particularly intrigued with the multiple possible interactions Ms. M had as a young girl growing up in the area.  As a child, Ms. M frequently walked in the woods with her sister.  On one occasion they had gotten lost and began to feel a sense of fear that did not seem connected to the fact that they were disoriented.  It was as if they were being watched.  They found their way back but this would not be the last time this sense of awareness that somebody or something was watching them was felt.  At Fifteen, Ms. M got into an argument with her father.  She left for the solitude of the woods and was not paying enough attention to her surroundings and became lost.  Dusk was approaching and it began to rain.  She found a spot on a log and quietly sobbed.  Initially she felt a peaceful feeling.  But suddenly \u0093like a switch was turned\u0094 she again got that feeling that she was being observed.  She ran and was lucky to make it back to her house before it was completely dark.Three years later and in the same area, Ms. M and her boyfriend were walking down a dark road.  She was pregnant at the time.  They both got the same feeling of being watched.  They picked up their pace and never saw anything but the feeling was unnerving.  Not long after, Ms. M gave birth to her son.  She was living in a mobile home and when he was a week old she was feeding him in the living room when she heard five very loud knocks on the side of the house.  She looked outside but saw nothing.  One week after this incident Ms. M had gone to console her son who was crying.  When she got back to her bed she again had that strange feeling of being watched.  She then heard a growl that was similar to others recorded near central Michigan. (Please see the links below) We discussed the growl and it seemed to sound like a grunt that turned into a growl.  She turned to the window and with the dull interior light and some available light outside she was able to see just the head of a reddish-brown hair covered human-like face.  This is the point where she said it could have been a guy in a mask but the window was nine feet high and later inspection showed that there was nothing for a prankster to stand on.  She got a good enough look to describe the hair as covering most of the face and the figure had huge nostrils.  She tried to explain that the figure looked very angry and seemed to be staring at her sleeping boyfriend.  I asked her how long the experience lasted, if she had made a sound, or if her boyfriend had responded.   The last question is why she added the comment about an ex-boyfriend to her report (which was filed after our discussion, explaining why some of this detail is repeated in this report).  She thought that the whole thing lasted a very long time, from the initial feeling of being watched to when the head suddenly disappeared.  She could not move and attributed this to fear.  She tried to speak in order to wake her boyfriend but was completely frozen and even when she did regain the ability to speak she found it difficult to explain what she had seen.  This is similar to an experience felt by a camper in report Report #35357 Later, she contacted her sister and found out that around a similar time and in a similar area, she too had been visited by something that looked in her window.  (The sister later described the \u0093face\u0094 and it was remarkably close to what Ms. M had seen).  She contacted the police who arrived on the scene but attributed it to someone in a mask.Our discussion then moved to why she would get these feelings while walking through the woods.  Was something out there attracted to her because she was crying?  Was something watching over her?  Did that \u0093protection\u0094 take the form of a menacing growl when Ms. M was observed with her boyfriend?  There is no way to know, but the idea is certainly very interesting.Here is a compilation of possible vocalizations from central Michigan:CentralMichiganmontageMore vocalizations can be found in this report from a nearby location:Report 32981",
