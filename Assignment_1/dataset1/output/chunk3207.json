It was later at night, they told me about seeing a bigfoot that began chasing them, they said they were doing about 30 mph or so, and that it was gaining on them, so once they got off the gravel drive and the road straightened, they sped up and lost it in the shadows. They were in an old Ford type El Camino with several people riding in the back that witnessed the event). However I doubt it's true for the simple fact that they were a bunch of drunken loudmouths and I just really didn't believe them. They had a knack for trying to out lie each other and their stories just didn't match when they told me about it at a later date.",

            "Observed": "It was midsummer of 1990, I was living alone in a mobile home in the woods adjoining Shawnee National Forest. I decided to go for a walk in the woods because I was bored and was thinking about shooting my rifle a bit. Nothing special, just what I normally did as a youth (since I'm not much of a people person I spent a lot of my youth in the woods). I was walking up a field road that passed thru a patch of woods that led to a larger feild on top of a hill a few hundred feet away. As I got halfway up the hill, I was suddenly shocked by a very loud whistle that was quickly followed by a scream that I had heard many times before as a kid.",

Right after turning off 60, I usually stop and turn on trailer backup lights and remove tailgate turnbuckles so I can see to back up at farm. On this morning, as I was walking to the back of the trailer, I heard a lot of noise, snapping limbs, sounds like something was pacing back and forth, in the patch of woods on the east side of road. As I got to the back of the trailer, I suddenly had the smell of a dead animal, strong, coming from the deep ditch on the west (field) side of the road. This road had one little property light up by the intersection, otherwise it was dark except for the small amount of light from the tractor and trailer backup flood lights. Suddenly I'm struck with fear. Now, I'm six foot 230lbs and don't scare easily, and cant explain the feeling that came on me. The noise in the woods was intensifying, getting louder, almost impatient, while the smell got more intense and I felt like there was something in the ditch staring at me. I was overwhelmed by the feeling of fear and ran back to the cab, took off into the farm and unloaded. I got out after unloading, this is just on the south side of the patch of woods and couldn't hear or smell anything and the feeling was gone.",
