Twice in the last month, witness has come home between 2-3am, while entering from the \"backside\" of his subdivision. That area is bordered by thick forest that eventually leads to a large lake.As witness entered the subdivision, on both occasions there were a large number of deer gathered beside the road. As witness passed the deer, he could see in his rearview mirror that the deer suddenly dispersed at high speed, moving away from the forest. Then he could see a large, brown biped emerge and run toward his car for a few steps before turning back and out of his view. Although he has frequently come home at this time of night and deer have been present, this same occurrence has happened twice now, and he says he was scared.Witness could not give a detailed description of what he saw, other than it was huge and definitely running on two feet. He does not remember any particular odor or sounds.He has, however, also heard howls from his home coming from the woods on several occasions. He described those as long and powerful. The witness' subdivision is new construction, built 3-4 years ago. The land was previously forest. ",
