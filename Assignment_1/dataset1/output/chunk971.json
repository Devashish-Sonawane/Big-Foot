            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness to discuss her experience.  She is very credible. Though her experience occurred when she was 13, she remembers the encounter well.During the encounter the animal was as close as 20 feet.  Throughout the incident the creature seemed to remain in a somewhat crouched position even while running along side her.  She is currently 5\u00924\u0094 tall and was close to that height at age 13.  The creature\u0092s shoulder, while in this crouched position, came to the height of her head.  She described the creature as being very \u0093massive\u0094 and \u0093muscular,\u0094 and this was the primary trait that most impressed her.  She, also, described the creature\u0092s hair as being about 3-4 inches long and being a \u0093glowing auburn, reddish-brown, almost orange\u0094 color.  The face was \u0093human-like\u0094 and was darker brown, almost black, in color.  The eyes were dark, the nose was wide, and the lips were \u0093not thick\u0094 with the upper lip being \u0093very wrinkled.\u0094  In drawing the shape of the head, the witness drew what could be interpreted as a possible sagittal crest.The creature, while running, apparently crashed through small pines and shrubs effortlessly knocking them down.  Once the witness reached a clearing, the creature did not venture out from the vegetation and remained in a position of cover.",

We were standing outside on the porch waiting for my husband and son to come home when we heard an awful scream coming out of the reserve. We lived right next to the Reserve. I owned peacocks so I know what they sound like. Some people say they sound like a person screaming. I always liked them and their call never bothered me. This was something I`d never heard and it scared us both. We ran to the car and locked the doors and waited. My husband said it was probably a panther. I never heard one so I don`t know.",
