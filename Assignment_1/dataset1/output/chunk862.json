They stated that it was 25 - 30 feet away, on their left and stood facing them. It then turned quickly and ran bipedally a few steps to an embankment that was approximately 6 feet behind it. When it reached the embankment it scrambled up it on all fours. As they passed it, they turned their heads to look back but it was gone. They were in a state of shock. His wife asked - \"What was that?\" Although the encounter was very brief, they were able to make these additional  observations:- The eyes shone white in the headlights, like a deer.- The hair on its head was shoulder length, while the body hair was   only 1 - 2 inches long.- The face was covered in hair, culminating in a beard.- The body hair was matted and filthy looking.The witness went back the following day to search for footprints, but could only find skid marks where it scrambled up the embankment.
