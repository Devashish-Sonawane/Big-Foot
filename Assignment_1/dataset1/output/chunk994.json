I poked my head out of the tent because my buddy and I had forgotten to zip it. I looked around and I was about to pull my head back in when I saw a strange figure slightly in the brush staring at me. I yelled not knowing what to do and woke my buddy who was in my tent up. I proceeded to tell him what had happened and he didn't believe me. In the morning we proceeded to get up and investigate. We found no foot prints but the brush had obviously been disturbed, there were also several stones by the side of both tents that seemed to have been thrown there. Although we had planned to stay another night, we left promptly after I shared my story with everyone.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness several times about the incident, and what he observed. Though not many details could be discerned about the figure, the witness was certain that it was very large, and covered with hair. I found his testimony to be truthful, and the witness himself credible. ----Rabun County has more of the Chattahoochee National Forest within its borders (148,684 acres / 601.7 square kilometers) than any of the other 18 counties with land included in the forest. It has an annual rainfall of over 70 inches per year, making it one of the rainiest places east of the Mississippi River. In terms of the terrain and the environment, it is one of the most likely places for sasquatches to thrive in the southeastern US. Members of the GA-BFRO team (including myself) have had encounters in the area, as well as finding and documenting fresh sasquatch tracks in remote portions of the county.----Historically, there are several references to sasquatches in the area. There are a few places with Cherokee names that refer to these animals, as well as European settler references. The oldest written account describing these animals in the area comes from 1812. According to an article printed in the Delphos, Ohio Daily Herald, a number of men from Virginia formed a search party with the sole purpose of locating one of these animals in 1816, but their efforts were to no avail.

I was about 2 miles from Bald Hills Road on Johnson's Road. I noticed in the forest a movement on my right. Then I noticed a large man-sized being, striding very fast away from the road. Then it jumped off an embankment. The early evening air was clear with sunlight showing through the forest. The being looked brown and gold in the forest and sunlight. When I went by, there was a bunch of dust in the air, where the being jumped off the embankment. I drove a little ways and came out onto the prairie. The creature was very fast and took long strides.",
