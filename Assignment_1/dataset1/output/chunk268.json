We followed them back into the woods till they faded out due to the wind and snow. We got back into our trucks and headed home when i got a flat tire and another truck ran out of gas. I headed back to town in the # 3 truck while the other friend who ran out of gas waited in his truck with his girlfriend for us to return with a spare and gas. while we were heading down blacksnake back to town we saw another set of fresh track coming ut og the woods, walking down the road a bit then off into the woods again.  we got out to look these over and it took two steps of my friend to match one step of the Sasquatch tracks. we  made video of the tracks and wen into town to get our supplys.  apon coming back u blacsnake the tracks were gone due to weather.  We repaired the trucks and went home",
