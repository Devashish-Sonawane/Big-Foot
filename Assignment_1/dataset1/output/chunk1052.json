            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness at the sighting location, and as I spoke with him I found him to be very credible as he related the details of his sighting without the least degree of variation.Additional details that can be added:- The creature was about 20 feet in-front of the truck.- The creature took three steps to cross the road.- The creature's hair was shaggy, and from 1-2 inches in length.- The hair color was light brown, with its back being a somewhat darker brown.- The arms were really long.- The witnesses have previously heard footsteps and a faint scream in the woods, and smelled a strong body odor/dead fish scent near their truck while they were parked near the area of the sighting.-  The creature had to come down a steep bank in order to cross the road.  - The area where the creature ran into is a stream bed with a lot of vegetation within a ravine.  - There was a discernible trail leading up the other side of the ravine from the sighting area.It is highly probable that the witnesses were privileged to see a sasquatch that evening.The picture below is the sighting area from he witnesses' point of view.  The creature crossed the road from right to left.The picture below is the bank which the creature descended in order to cross the road.The picture below is the area that the creature ran into after it crossed the road.Here is a closer image of the area that the creature ran into after it crossed the road.Hilltop road is in North Marysville and is directly west of a large wooded area that runs virtually uninterrupted into the Cascade foothills, and has ample room for large animals to move undetected.  The direction that the creature was traveling when seen was towards the wooded area.",
