            "Follow-Up Report": "First, I would like to disclose that the witness and I shared an office at work. He is aware of my interest in the Bigfoot phenomena and as we were discussing a recent BF Townhall that I attended, he related his sighting to me. After listening to his account of what he saw that night; I suggested that he file a sighting report on the BFRO Website.After I was assigned this report I met the witness at the house where the incident occurred. He has since then sold the house and the approximately 17 acres that it sits on. The driveway loops around an area about 75 feet in diameter where the witness parked his fifth wheel camper. I had the witness repeat his steps of that night and can add the following details to his account. After taking the garbage to the road and returning down the dirt driveway, he was using the flashlight to avoid stepping in the many dips that are scattered along the length of the driveway. As he got closer to the house he noticed movement coming from the direction of his garage. His first sighting of the creature occurred when he was approximately 50 feet away. The creature was moving away from the garage and toward his fifth wheel camper walking in a bipedal motion which, the witness described as gliding and very smooth. His truck and girlfriend\u0092s car were parked in front of the garage and would have blocked some of the light emanating from the garage. His adjustable flashlight was set to a narrow beam. Pointing his flashlight towards the figure he illuminated the creature\u0092s torso, which along with the vehicles blocking the light from the garage may explain why he did not see the creature\u0092s legs. Observing the creature from the side, the witness estimates that the upper torso width, back to front, ranged from 20 to 24 inches and the shape of the head from the side was cone-like. The creature did not look in his direction and continued walking away from the garage and disappeared behind the fifth wheel. Using the 12 foot height of the fifth wheel as a reference, he was able to estimate the height of the creature at 7 \u00bd to 8 feet tall.When the creature went behind the fifth wheel, the witness quickly walked up to the fifth wheel and observed the creature enter the woods on the other side of the circular driveway about 100 feet from the front of the fifth wheel. At this point the creature disappeared quietly into the swampy woods which are very thick with many downed trees and brush covering the ground.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The gentleman contacted a BFRO Volunteer, who in turn contacted me about this sighting.The man was driving to work in the dark at about 5:15 am on a Tuesday morning. He was southbound on Markham Woods Road nearing State Road 434.  He was passing a church on the left when he noticed what he thought was an up-ended couch someone had dumped on the other side of the road. As he neared it, he realized it was a hairy figure that was squatting and it suddenly stood up, facing him. He passed it so closely, his mirror almost hit it. It never tried to step aside as he approached. He checked the rear view mirror once he passed it and the figure was no longer there.When he passed in the car, he was only able to see the chest and arm thru his closed window. The witness is 6\u00924\u0094 and can stand near his truck with his head reaching the window. The figure was much taller than him, as the arm and chest were only visible to him. The witness states that it clearly wasn\u0092t a bear and at the time he thought, \u0093But, bigfoot doesn\u0092t exist!\u0094 Its hair seemed about 6 inches long and was mixed brown and some white in color. It was muscular and the chest was very wide. The area isn\u0092t an area you would expect to see a bigfoot until you look at a satellite photo of the area. It  is heavily wooded and the homes are set apart amongst the woods. The Little Wekiva River runs parallel to the road just a few hundred feet from it and the other side is I-4.  This river flows out of Wekiva Buffer Conservation Area which has been the subject of many reports.  The church, and the rest area near the sighting have dumpsters. From the witnesses\u0092 description, it seemed the creature was heading towards the river. Google earth image of the location:",
