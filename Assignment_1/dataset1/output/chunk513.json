            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness over the phone. A site investigation is not possible at this time due to winter snow pack.As stated in her report, they camp in this area often. For several years, they went there every Thanksgiving weekend. This would be about as late in the year as one could access the area. The hunting season is long over by this time in this area. She also said that there is a lot of food in that area. Rabbits are all over the place. Most of the time when they go to this site, they have the feeling that they are being watched. They usually hear wood knocking and whistles. This particular time they both experienced repeated very loud screaming anytime they ventured very far from camp. On one occasion, she attempted to walk down to the lake, and she was screamed at with every step. She said that it was so loud that she could feel it. She turned around and went back. Her husband reported smelling something that was described as \u0093a very strong rotten-sour-putrid smell\u0094.  Further, that night during a wind storm, she could hear the pots and pans clanking around, and expected to find a mess in the morning. What she found was that everything was right where it had been. She also reported the heavy thump of what she thought was a pile of logs being thrown onto the ground beside the trailer. In the morning, there were no logs to be found. It is possible that a tree fell over nearby during the night which they did not notice, but that is just a guess.I asked her specifically about the hot links which she mentioned being thrown out. She said that they were so spicy-hot that she could not eat them, so she threw them about 20 feet outside the camp. She said that what she heard was like someone eating something that was unexpectedly hot and was reacting to the spiciness by making a \u0093hoo-hoo\u0094 sound in the same way we might do it.There is a combination of occurrences here which taken together, lead me to the conclusion that this is a credible report. These are the persistent screaming in reaction to the actions of the witnesses, the foul stench, the sound of something eating the hot links and the reaction to that, and the activity outside the tent trailer with the cooking gear.The name has She also said that there is a lot of food in that area. Rabbits are all over the place. ",
