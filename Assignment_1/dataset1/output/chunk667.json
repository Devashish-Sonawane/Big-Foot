The witness asserted the knocks suggest up to three Sasquatch actively communicating with each other.",

That was probably Sept. 2018. A deer scared me from across the road and I bolted out of the forest then winter came. It looks like the trees are not in the same shape now put we can't get the truck back in there to look at it yet till the road drys out.",
