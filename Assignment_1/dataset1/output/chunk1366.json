            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness shared an amazingly detailed account of his experience.  He described what he first thought was a cross-country skier crossing the trail behind them.  As he stared at the figure, he noticed that if it were a skier, it would be male due to its body shape: very broad at the shoulders and narrowing significantly at the waist. He was also very tall, \"like Shaquille O'Neal size.\" The witness noticed that the figure must have been wearing a ski hat due to a cone like shape of the head.  What seemed strange was everything the figure was wearing was the same color.  His hat, coat, gloves and pants were all a dark, rusty red glistening in the light.  Where the eyes and nose would be was very dark to black. He said, \"I thought it was a skier at first, but then I didn't see any skis!  Maybe a snowshoer?  No!  No snowshoes!  Then it was gone!\"  While trying to rationalize what he saw, many thoughts went through his mind.  He thought it would be very strange for someone to just be walking around in the area. He realized at this point that he must have seen a sasquatch.  The witness resides in Seattle, Washington and is an avid fly fisherman who is very familiar with wildlife sightings, including grizzly bear.  \"This was not a bear, it was bipedal, it walked upright like a man, taking huge strides,\" but its arms were long, hands falling at or below the knee.  The witness watched the figure cross the trail and disappear over a ravine into a cedar swamp.  The witness had to travel back over the area where the figure crossed, but he did not want to stop and look for tracks. His wife was on the snowmobile with him, but she did not see the figure cross the trail.  The witness did not tell his wife what he thought he saw until later that evening and he has only shared this incident with two other people.   Two photos of a possible structure I found while investigating this report:It is about 5'10\" at the center.  These are trees in this structure. This was just off the power lines.  I drove the power lines for about a 1/2 mile from a main road.  I could see this structure from my car right at the tree line.",
