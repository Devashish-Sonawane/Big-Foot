            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness and investigator Brad Kennan at the location on November 28. I had already talked to the witness by phone shortly after he filed the report. We had, prior to the point of going to the sighting location, had the original pictures looked at by members of the BFRO to make sure there had been no tampering and to try and get a better look at the images.This took place at Clear Creek Park which is a 5000 acre portion of the Columbus Metro Park system. This portion is just south of Lancaster, Ohio. While the park itself is not large, it is located in the Hocking Hills Region of southeastern Ohio. It is very close to the Wahkeena Nature Preserve, Old Man's Cave, and is just a couple of miles from the large Wayne National Forest. The park valley itself is the farthest southern point of the glacier reaches, providing rich flat bottoms surrounded by hardwood forests. There is one main road that runs through the park.The sighting took place at Lake Ramona which is a five acre lake. In order to access the lake you must first park and then walk in. If anyone else was in the area it would have been readily apparent. After viewing the pictures, talking to this witness and realizing there had been several other reports within two miles of this location, we decided to go and take measurements and get a better idea of the terrain. After reviewing the pictures, and being at the location, investigator Brad Kennan and I can agree on the following:  The location has an existing history of sightings; this area is prime territory for these creatures to exist; the witness was very sincere and believable; and stick breaking and rock throwing is behavior often reported during encounters with sasquatches.We find the pictures themselves inconclusive. They do resemble a lot of pictures taken around the country and may very well show a bigfoot, it is just impossible for us to say with any certainty. Nonetheless, the pictures are included for the public's own evaluations and opinions. It should be noted that his three photos were taken as he held the camera up with his arm extended, one right after the other, at the direction the noises were coming from. (We have not included the photo mentioned of the boy having his senior photo taken. The background in the photo is just not very clear and not worth this boy's privacy.)This is one of the images taken, note the dark figure circled in red.The following two images are an attempt to get a closer look at the dark figure circled above in red.  The second image draws attention to possible features of the unknown figure and a white object.This is a photo of me in the same location as the figure for comparison and for measurements, unfortunately taken at a different time of the year. I am holding a six foot post. As you can see, even with the leaves off the trees the area still provides good cover. We determined the rocks were being thrown from a location that would have provided a secure view, with a readily available escape route to the deep forest.  Using a laser we were able to determine that the unknown figure was about 95 yards from the photographer/witness.  This is a blown-up image of me in the above photo for comparison.In the photos it almost looks like the figure is next to a cave or rocks, when in fact it was next to this rootball pictured below. The creature would have been on the other side of this rootball, as seen from this photo, as we are looking back toward the lake and where the witness stood.The original larger photo can be downloaded here.  It is 5 Meg and can take some time to download.Click here",

            "Observed": "A friend and I were hiking up to Franklin Falls on a warm, late afternoon in August. The woods were pretty quiet with just the sound of the river and the distant sound of traffic from the interstate. As far as I know, we were alone on the trail though it's a popular one. We were walking along talking and all of a sudden there was a high, throaty, wailing scream (or rather three or four of them) that echoed off the mountainsides and made the hair stand up on the backs of our necks. We were both raised in Washington and have spent a lot of time in the woods, heard the sounds that a lot of different kinds of widlife make and agreed that neither of us had ever heard anything like that before. It didn't sound like the source was really close but the volume was incredible and with the screams bouncing off of the hills around us, it wasn't possible to judge the distance. It was a scary sound and un-nerved us so badly that we turned around and went back to our car and drove away. I don't know if it was just fright or what but we felt watched all the way. I will never forget that sound and the closest thing I've heard is the recordings that supposedly are the sounds of the Sasquatch. The memory of it still raises goosebumps and makes the hair at the back of my neck tingle. We've only told a few friends about this and I must admit feeling a little odd telling it now.",
