He spent several hours listening to other wildlife vocalizations, including owls and coyotes, to match what he and his father heard. He could not match it to anything else but was able to closely match the vocalizations to both the ('73) Puyallup, WA and ('78) Snohomish County, WA recordings on the BFRO site. Both he and and his father were visibly shaking from what they heard. The vocalization lasted approximately 10 seconds.  He described the vocalization as either a \"hooting\" or \"whooping\" sound. I found this witness to be very credible and sincere with what he heard.",
