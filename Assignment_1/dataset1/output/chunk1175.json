That's when I took off.",

Since this, I have met a person who believes he has been having encounters while camping in this forest. I have seen pictures of tracks made approximately 10 miles from this location. When you talk to the local folks, they will tell you about these creatures. However, nobody is doing any real research there, so it stays fairly quiet. I did contact the rangers station headquarters in Warren Pa but have never heard back from them.",

I find him 100% credible.These details can be added: * There were no trees between him and the Sasquatch to obscure any part of his view.* He originally thought it might be leaning forward because the arms were so long.* The witness had a camera and a gun, but it never occurred to him to use either.*The witness described the eyes as being totally dark, seeing no white in the eyes at all.*The creature was very thick chested, 3 feet wide, and very muscular weighing approximately 500lbs. It's fingers were unusually long, and he saw much muscular definition in the biceps.*The hair was shiny black and was 3 to 4 inches in length.

While sitting there in the dark, I continually had the feeling that I was being watched. I have had this same feeling 2 other times, and in both situations I spotted a Mountain Lion watching me from a distance.",
