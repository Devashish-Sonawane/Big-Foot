            "Observed": "First of all I have kept this to myself for many years, for fear that people would say we were nuts. It was early summer late spring my brother and I were test driving his new toyota pickup,  I guess it would be south and east of the millcreek watershed near the wash. oregon boarder.We had just crossed millcreek and passed the watershed entrance about a mile or so up the hill.The road was gravel and one side was steep embankment down into the gorg and the other went straight up.We had stopped to take a leak on the side of the road. As I stand there I looked across the gorg, it was approx. 100 yds. and there on an old tree stump was this thing, just standing there motionless looking at us. It was about 2:30 or so in the afternoon clear sunny day  about 75 degrees. I quickly turned to my brother who was standing at the other end of the truck and told him to look up on the hill. We both stood there looking at this thing look at us for a good 5 min. or so. then as if it were never there it turned and disappeared into the trees. It looked like a large hairy man kinda brownish with dark streaks and patches on the shoulders and hips and legs.It moved so quickly , it was there one second gone the next. I do not recall any significant smells but it was big what ever it was.We could not get to the area where it was standing do to the terrain so we could not see if there were any tracks. But if they are out there that area above walla walla is where they are.",

This past June,2003, around the 17th, about 5 PM, we were hiking the Quinault Rainforest Nature Trail,on the south shore of the lake, down at the Cedar Bog area. While at the bog, something dark and large moved behind the reeds/ tall plants there, about 10 yards from where we stood. It could have been a bear, or something that had been crouched down looking for something.Whatever it was, it moved away, and we never got a [good] glimpse of it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I followed up with the witnesses on several occasions and scouted the site of the incidents twice.  I visited the site(s) on April 10th and May 14th, 2005.  The area(s) were lush and thick, with streams threading the area near the lake.  One of the witnesses noted that when he heard the sound of the [animal], his \"jaw dropped.\"  This is of some significance, as one of the witnesses is a retired zookeeper, and said that he had never heard anything like this animal.  He investigated animal vocalizations on-line and determined that the noise was similar to other sasquatch recordings.  The witnesses indicated that the vocalization lasted for approximately five seconds.  The witnesses also verified that they had definitely heard three loud taps that sounded like a stick or rock rapped against a tree.The witnesses stated that they had seen snapped off branches near a game trail, and that there was an inaccessible print nearby.  The branches were large and twisted at the top, but they were unable to reach them.  They also smelled something that was \"strong, like an outhouse, but not fecal in origin.\"  It was \"putrid, disgusting and powerful,\" and there was \"very little breeze at the time.\"    While the witnesses are uncertain regarding their large animal sighting, they are certain that the vocalization was a sasquatch.  One of the witnesses stated that, \"It's... such an uncommon sound.\"  This witness' zookeeping experience provides much support for his experience and his findings.  ",
