            "Observed": "This past wednesday night I was watching TV in my game room above the garage. It was around twelve or twelve thirty when it sounded like something hit one of the garage doors. I waited about five seconds before I looked out the window because it freaked me out a little. I then looked out the window to see a large thing, well over six feet tall, covered in hair right below the window. The hair was almost dread like, it was long and matted. When I saw it it was already heading back into the woods. It was gone within two seconds.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness who recounted his siting as described in his report. Additional information was revealed and included his surprise at what he saw, that the animal had large arms, hands, and feet, and that it moved very quickly. While the night was dark, there was sufficient light coming from the open garage for him to see these details in the brief time that he observed the animal. He woke another family member who went outside but there were no tracks or any other type of physical evidence. The area is along Cat Creek Road, locally known as the old Valdosta Road.Other than a friend hearing an unusually loud \"Whipporwill\" type whistle two weeks later during an evening visit, the family has had no further incidents.This is a rural area dominated by an agricultural economy, thus large areas of pasture and crop fields. The area has abundant water and cover. There is a high concentration of deer and wild hogs in this area. Much of the area is swamp and there are numerous rivers and creeks with very thick vegetation. The Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge and Swamp is about 40 miles away. There are several additional reports in this general area.",
