Darrel explains that they were not looking at something moving, they were looking at the creature for several seconds, standing in the middle of the road, 10-15 feet from them, with the high-beams on it.  The large, round eyes were reflecting orange-red.  The head movement he described was similar to the way a dog might cock its head when you talk to it.  The impression was that it was very curious about them.  He stated everything about it was \"huge\" and the color was very dark brown and/or black.  The following day they found no tracks where it had exited the road thru an opening in the trees and bushes, made by heavy equipment clearing the now developed land.  Haines Creek runs nearby and the area is surrounded by several, large lakes.",
