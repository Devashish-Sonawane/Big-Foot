            "Observed": "at the time i saw this i was driving an 18 wheeler on highway 71 south of fouke ark near the crossing of the sulpher river going north at around 1 am the headlights of my rig picked out what i thought wat a dead tree trunk about 6ft or so tall off the right side of the road next to the water. i saw eyes shining in the headlites and thought it must be an owl or something in the tree but as i got closer the \"tree\" walked off into the swamp i never saw anything so weird as i went by the  place it had been something screemed load enough i could hear it over the sound of the truck with the windows closed and i sure wasn't going back to see what it was.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness I have the following to add:The witness is a truck driver and he had just made a delivery in Shreveport, LA. Around 1:00 a.m. while heading north on Hwy 71 he approached the Sulphur River bridge  and saw  two bright red eyes in what appeared to be a dead tree off of the right side of the road on the edge of the water about 200 yards away. The eyes continued to shine until he got within 100 yards, then the \u0093dead tree\u0094 turned away from the road and walked into the brush on two legs. As the witness approached the site of the creature, he let off his throttle to slow down. His engine brakes made a deep rumbling sound. He immediately  heard the deafening scream and left the scene.The creature had a dull gray color, like that of a dead tree. It took huge steps  and covered the ground quickly without any noticeable arm movement.The witness had never heard of a bigfoot-type creature outside of the Pacific Northwest.  The location of this incident is adjacent to the 16,000 acre Sulphur River Wildlife Management Area. The area consists of one of the last remaining large tracts of bottomland hardwood habitat along the Red River valley. The Sulphur River runs for about 10 miles through the management area. Bottomland hardwoods, cypress breaks, and numerous oxbow lakes cover the land. The area is known for its remoteness and lack of access.",

            "Observed": "On or about 00:30 Hours (12:30 AM), February 10, 2015, give or take 30 minutes, I was on my way home from work.  I work in Overland Park, Kansas and live in Lansing, Kansas.  I have been working a special project and my hours are from 3 PM to Midnight.  I was driving North on K-7 Highway just past Leavenworth Road near Falcon Estates Subdivision when a very large animal darted across the road in front of me running on two feet.  I did not slow down and was only able to see the back end of the animal.  The only thing in my mind right now is the fur pattern that I saw.  The fur looked a little longer than my hair which would make the hair about 2 to 3 inches and a little darker than color tan but a lighter color than the color brown, more of a dirty blond, it had waves in the hair, almost curly in areas.  It was larger and faster than any deer that I have ever seen in the area.  The size could be a large horse or elk.  I am glad that I did not hit it because of its size it would have totaled my car.  I cannot be 100% sure but it could have been a Big Foot.  The tail bone was about even to the middle of my driver\u0092s side window.  I drive a Ford Focus.  I was just amazed by the fur color and texture.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with the witness for 40 minutes or so. Witness is a retired police officer. After retiring as a police officer, he worked at both the Federal prison at Leavenworth and minimum security prison in Lansing KS, just up the road. He was clear, precise, just as he would have been as a police officer. His account is as follows: He was travelling north as stated, at about 65-70 MPH. The bipedal creature ran in front of his car at a diagonal angle, going east to west. He was in the passing lane, and the second car was behind him as stated. The lights from that car illuminated the creature as well, so as far as he was concerned, the area was very well lit. The creature was no more than 5-6 feet away from him at the initial sighting, and \"if my arms were 6 feet long, I could have reached out the front passenger window and touched it\".  His physical description is as follows: 9ft tall and appx. 600-700 lbs. Hair, (NOT fur) was 2-3 inches in length and flapping as it ran. Definite upright bipedal creature. Musculature was observed as it ran and as stated, the tail bone was at mid wind height if his Ford Probe, which put that portion of the creature at 4-4.5 ft. tall. That is how he arrived at the 9 ft. estimate. He did not see the face and or upper body, as it was running away from him and he was driving and trying to keep his cool and control of the vehicle. He was a bit surprised the car behind him did not see anything, or at least they did not indicate by stopping or slowing down, that they saw anything. That was part of the reason he did not keep looking at the creature as it crossed over to the driver's side, because he was trying to keep the other car in view to avoid an accident. Time \"seemed to slow down considerably, much as it did when I was a police officer in high stress or critical situations\", and thus his recollection of the event was crystal clear. There is no doubt in his mind now, as to what he saw. After the event, he went home, pulled out pen and paper, and stated that he \"wrote my report as I would if I were still on duty while things were still fresh\". As he stated, everything was in slow motion, his recollection of events did not waive. I am familiar with this area, having traveled it once a month for three years. It is rich fertile farmland, rotated with corn & soybeans. Deer are plentiful, as are turkey, good water sources, and the Missouri (Kansas) river is close, and numerous creeks. Not heavily wooded but enough timber certainly for cover. If I were to pick a witness whose clarity and recollection of events were not likely to be called into question, I would pick a law enforcement officer. He was clear and precise. I believe him. ",
