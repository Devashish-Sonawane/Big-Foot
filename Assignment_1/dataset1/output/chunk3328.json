            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness in length on numerous occasions. I also visited the location of the encounter with the witness and another researcher on the morning of July 1st 2006. The following observations where made.Possible knuckles print and tracks where found and photographed, which are attached below. The tracks were not well defined as the forest floor was covered with a thick layer of pine needles. One track measured in at 12\" long by 6\" wide. There was a row of tracks in the pine needles leading deeper into the forest off of the trail. These tracks had little or no definition, but you could make out the path by the disturbance of the pine needles. The tracks were in a straight line and in my opinion were made by a bipedal animal, not a bear or a deer. Also the distance between each track (the gait) was 4 1/2' to 5'.At one point I heard a thump that sounded to me like a large rock hitting the sand trail just behind us. I was able to recreate this sound by having one of the participants pick up a rock and toss it. There were no smells or other noises. The witness did show us some bones of a deer, but nothing distinctively relevant was observed. After meeting the witness and surveying the location I feel this person did indeed encounter something unusual there. Therefore this is a solid Class B report.",
