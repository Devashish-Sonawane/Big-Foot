He stated that he smelled the animal before he sighted it, thinking there was something dead in the area.   It was laying on the other side of a fallen tree.   As soon as he struck the tree with the tree branch, it immediately jumped up and ran away with great speed. He is not sure if it was black or very dark brown.   The fur was kind of matted in places and looked to be about 3 or 4 inches long. He stated several times in the conversation that the one thing he remembers most clearly is the enormous size of the hind end of the animal (buttocks).  He stated that the hind end was just enormous and very powerful looking. The bedding area had the fallen log on one side, and the entire area had the ground scraped up and cleared, with about 8 to 12 inch sides where it apparently pushed up the soil and debris.   I am planning on meeting the witness in the location after firearms deer season ends.",

At about 3:00 am I woke to what sounded like rocks being smacked together or stacked, I woke my boyfriend, (now husband) and a LARGE animal/animals proceeded to CRASH through the woods around us. It was big and breaking branches huge crashes I was Scared! It eventually made its way around our camping site and walked off but I was waiting to be attacked. Sadly in the morning we never investigated the area, we woke up early and left the camp site. I don't camp deep in the woods anymore!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "While on Twitter one night I found a post regarding a possible encounter that happened to a group of campers near New Era.  I was intrigued by the possibility of a report from a place I was so familiar with.  I had previously researched this area and have camped for years in the Manistee National Forest so I am familiar with the location and the availability of forage for game animals as well as year-round water from numerous streams in this area like the many branches of the White River along with many acres of marsh and swampland.  This location is heavily forested.  If one were to travel from the town of Whitehall and head west you could almost completely stay within the forests until you reached the shore of Lake Michigan.  I decided to contact the sender of the Tweet.Mrs. S responded immediately and filed a report on our database.  We began discussing her case and there were similarities between her encounter and other reports from campers nearby.  After speaking with Mrs. S I found out that there was more to the story.  It appeared that she may have also had a sighting of a creature lying in the road.  Before I knew about the possible sighting I asked Mrs. S about her experience.  She very clearly told me where the incident occurred, who she was with and what they had been doing.  I asked her to describe the night in as much detail as possible including everything she could remember regarding what she heard and what it sounded like to her.  I further asked if she thought it might have been people pulling some sort of practical joke on her.  The following is her story in her own words as dictated by me:\"The encounter lasted maybe 5-10 minutes, it started with just rocks being smacked together and that's when I woke my then boyfriend now husband.\" What follows is a sample of possible stone clacking recorded by this researcher in central Michigan in 2012: Central Michigan sound recording \"Whatever it was made no vocalizations and we did not smell anything. The reason I knew it wasn't a deer or bear was because it was so loud but there were no vocalizations from an angry bear or a deer blowing. It crashed through brush like it didn't care who was around.  It sounded like it circled our campsite and headed north off into the woods.The reason I do not believe it was a prank is because only five people knew where we were. None of which would have been up for or willing to go out at that time of night just to scare us. Also the two-track leading to our campsite had been blocked by loggers and you have to go on foot.  I think there may have been a couple of individuals in the woods because of the rock clacking, (Thought by many researchers to be a possible form of communication) but I do not know for sure as it could have been echoes.  I'm sorry I cannot give any more info. As I said we were scared and did not want to investigate.\"I needed to know about what she saw in the road.  Mrs. S stated that in 2003 or 2004 she believed that she saw something lying in the road as she drove in an area not too far from her camping experience four years previously.  Mrs. S provided the following information and then added a sketch of what she had seen:\"As for the creature in the road, it was fall and at night so it was dark. If I had to guess a time I would say between 7-9 pm. There was no rain, snow or fog but it was dark so you can only see really what your head lights show you.  The roads were clear, we had just passed (omitted), I had to slow nearly to a stop because a car was in the opposite lane and I had to drive out of my lane to pass the creature in the road.  I am not completely or even partially sure it was dead there was not blood or anything like that, only the chimp-like body laying there.It looked like a full grown chimp lying in the road, its fur was shaggy black to brown, and its face was flat, that why I know it wasn't a bear. Also its limbs were long, almost longer in the arms then in the legs. Its torso was skinny too skinny for even a starving bear. If I saw this creature standing I would say it would have been 4 to 5 feet tall.As I said, we were scared because we did not know where an animal like this would come from or if there were bigger ones in the woods. As soon as we got around it we left. When we finally got the guts to drive back, about 10-20 minutes later it was gone, with no blood or visible marks in the road so we just left.  Again I do not know if the creature was dead, because it was gone.  I look forward to hearing more from you and am anxious to hear what other people have seen since this has left us feeling a little crazy. It\u0092s hard having your family or friends look at you like you\u0092re nuts when you KNOW you saw/experienced something like this.\"",
