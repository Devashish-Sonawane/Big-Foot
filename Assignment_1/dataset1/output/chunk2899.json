            "Follow-Up Report": "   I spoke with the witness on the phone. I found him to be credible and eager to share his experience with someone.He and his family have been using this hunting spot for many years.   In the previous year he heard several vocalizations throughout the night, until he and his dad left the camp to go into town. No other activity happened that trip.Then the following year they sighted two, 7-8 foot, black, hairy, bipedal, upright walking creatures. He said that one of the things that he remembers the most was how fast and nimble they were going up very steep terrain, which would have been impossible for a human to accomplish.They left later that night because a member of their party no longer wanted to remain in the woods. He and his father returned a few days later to look for evidence of what they saw. There were small trees placed across the road and when they got out to investigate they encountered a strong odor that was only in the area of the broken trees. They continued to look around the area and found possible footprint impressions, but they lacked detail. They followed these footprints for a short while and found a large scat.I attempted to reach the campsite where the events took place but due to recent snowfall the area is impossible to reach until next spring. However, given the history of the Mount Hood National Forest and sasquatch I do believe they had sasquatch activity and a brief sighting of two creatures on two separate occasions in the same location.",
