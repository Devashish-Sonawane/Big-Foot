            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness and found him to be very credible.  He has years of experience driving a snow plow through rugged mountain canyons and had no particular belief or experiences with Bigfoot before this occurred. The lights mounted on the snow plow were much brighter than average headlights and easily lit up the road several hundred yards ahead of the truck. While sitting in the cab of the truck the witness estimated his view was about seven and a half feet off of the ground and even with the animal's eyes. The animal did turn and look at him but didn't break its stride or slow down. The witness did check for footprints the next day but couldn't find any because of the recent snow storm. Based on my field investigation of the area I determined there are plenty of herds of both elk and deer with miles of thick cover and water that can support a population of bigfoot. The area is known for bigfoot sightings. All of this combined with the lighting conditions of the snowplow lead me to believe this witness saw a bigfoot that night. We interviewed this witness for the show \"Finding Bigfoot\" and he joined the cast and local investigators for a few days.",
