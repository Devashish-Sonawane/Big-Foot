            "Follow-Up Report": "Excerpts from interview with witness, who is familiar with both black and grizzly bears, having once worked with the Great Bear Foundation. \"It was kind of weird. I was coming out of my tent, and had to turn in a half-crouched position to see it. When I did, I froze. (What did you see?) It was just this giant furred animal that was not a bear. I live in bear country and this was not any animal I have ever seen.\"\"This face that was staring at me was very humanoid, fur covered, much more humanoid kind of face, and it was so big. I'm used to big. My brother is 6''7\" and my nephew 6'10\" and growing. I had a great uncle called Shorty because he was only 6-2, so I'm used to big.\"\"My guess is this animal was 7.5 to 8 feet tall. After I got back out of the mountains, I looked at an 8 foot ceiling and thought, yeah, that would have filled the space.\"(How close?)\"It was very close, so close its legs were hidden by the end of the tent. What I saw was roughly from the waist up. As soon as I turned and froze in place it did too. It's hard to know how long we actually looked at each other without moving. It may have been a minute, just staring at each other. It was looking directly at me...\"(On the creature's unusual vocalization.) \"It made this glance at the goats and looked back at me. Then it made this low rumbling sound. I'm a musician. This sound was so much on the low range, I got the feeling that there were frequencies I couldn't hear. Then it moved, and I got a glimpse of another one behind it. I only had a glimpse of it but when it made the low rumbly sound, the other one kind of looked in at me.\"(Witness describes its gait.)\"It loped off, gracefully. It had a lilting walk. It left fast. By time I got around the tent to look where it was, it had totally disappeared.\"(I asked about the light at the time.)\"It was dusk. It was getting dark, but it was still adequately light to see well. Earlier in the day, it had been overcast and  there had been a lot of electrical storm activity, no rain, just lightning.\"(On witness's reaction to the encounter.)\"I didn' feel threatened at all. My instincts were to just freeze. I felt completely terrified and completely in awe --amazed -- simultaneously, but I felt so unthreatened, I stayed for the night.\"(On the pepper spray the witness carries.)\"I don't think pepper spray would daunt what I saw. It might have been a very minor annoyance, at best. Nothing in its behavior made me want to use it.My younger dog kept sprinting off into the woods, like she would get real interested in something. I think she perceived whatever was there was kind of a human-type creature.''Addendum 1/13/2003The witness originally asked that we not publish her report out of concern that she would be easily identified as the one who made it. Because the report was so singular and compelling, we tried to address her concerns while maintaining the essential details. One change was that we agreed to change pack-goats to llamas, because the goat-packing community is so small.After she agreed to be interviewed for a story in The Denver Post in Nov. 2002,  She asked that her BFRO report be corrected to reflect that the use of goats and not llamas.",
