            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with two of the sons and son-in-law by phone. I also met the witness, his wife and son at their rural family home. The following on-site interview were conducted by me. The first names of the witnesses have been changed.   Tom - Me and my brother and my brother-in-law were down the road here, we were walking through some brush. We came out, it's like a corn field, it has path for a combine to get down into it. It is all surrounding by trees. We came out of the brush on one side and we were walking in the corn field where it had just been plowed. We saw a deer along the tree line and stopped and sat there and listened. We had a spotlight and the deer definitely wasn't making any noise and he was looking around. It was like nothing I have ever heard and my brother-in-law, who lives in the mountains, have never heard anything like it either. It was weird sounding. If I would have had to guess, something like a bear but louder.Stan - Was it a growl or a scream?Tom - More of a scream. It would scream, pause, and we would be looking for it, and then it would scream and pause. We never did find anything and we ended up leaving because we couldn't see anything.Stan - How many times did it scream?Tom - I would say four or five screams before we left.Stan - Did it seem like it was walking away at the time?Tom - We had the feeling it was watching, it was always in the same direction and it was always the same pitch level, we just couldn't see anything. It freaked us out pretty bad so we pretty much ran back home.Stan - And what year was this?Tom - 2006.Stan - And then a different time you had another experience?Tom - Yes, I was with a different brother and my brother-in-law. We had taken the path, we went down to where we had heard it the first time. We were walking through beans that were still green about knee level high. We were walking through and we see these three deer come through the little patch of trees and they stop and look at us and they keep looking back. They keep creeping towards us.We heard a scream and the deer didn't know which to be more afraid of, so they started running at us and then they went off to the left and into the trees. And then we heard it a few more times and we couldn't find it again and so we got out of there.Stan - And was this after dark?Tom - Yes, both times was after dark. Stan - And what year was this?Tom - 2007.Mike - They came home and they were all scared, I had never seen my oldest son that scared before. I said \"You guys are dreaming, I want to hear it myself.\" We passed out the weapons, shotguns, deer rifles, high powered rifles and stuff. We took off down there as fast as we could, we got down there and they were showing where all this stuff had happened. We had these big hand spotting lights. We had one, I hadn't turned it on and we started walking by and all of a sudden I just hit this big field on the road, I was lead, and I hit it.And I seen a big dark, dish-water type dirt, it wasn't black coal like a bear. I have seen bears before, it wasn't like that, it was a lighter color and it had its arms spread apart. And when it ran it spread its arms apart like that, and boom it was gone. Just a split second like that.Stan - So you saw it using the spotlight?Mike - Yes, so we could hear something, so we ran down there into the trees. It sounded like it was walking. We didn't hear it again. So we left and came back home. So that is what happened with that and I don't think we've been back over since that. It pretty well scared everybody pretty good.Stan - How tall would you say it was?Mike - It is hard to say, it was a rolling hill and I don't know how close it was to the top and it just disappeared like that. It was wide through the shoulders, a good three and half feet, but the thing I really noticed a lot was no neck, really no neck, but long hair from the upper arms.  Stan - From the upper arms?Mike - Yes, that hung straight down with its arm spread apart, that is weird, nothing like I've read about or anything. (The witness demonstrated to me that it ran with its arms horizontal to the ground, sort of spread eagle style.)Stan - What about height?Mike - I really can't tell you, it was big. Just from the shoulders, I thought, that is big. He was tall.Stan - What about weight, could you estimate?Mike - No, it was quick, it was big.    ",

            "Observed": "It\u0092s taken me a long time to write this report because shortly after the incident, I managed to convince myself that it couldn\u0092t have been a bigfoot.  A few months later, a friend had a nearly identical incident at the same location which made me reconsider.  As a mechanical engineer, I am trained in the hard sciences and as such, I am a scientist.  I really don\u0092t believe in something unless there is hard evidence or the scientific community is in agreement.  Since the incident and my friend\u0092s incident I have been doing a lot of research and feel that there is substantial evidence that a forest primate exists in North America.  As a scientist, my previous position was that something could exist but there was not enough evidence to prove it.  I do admit that I have always had an interest in the bigfoot phenomenon and knew some things about it like wood knocking, howls, etc.  I also took a natural anthropology class in college.  My teacher was one of the most famous anthropologist of our time and I learned well about all of the primates, the australopithecines , early hominids and of course gigantopithicus. My point is that I am an intelligent person who had an informed skeptical position concerning the bigfoot phenomenon but has come to believe that the forests are inhabited by either an early hominid or a great ape, or something in between.  I am known for my situational memory and feel that my remembrance of the incident has not diminished.  I have told my story many times and every time I get goose bumps.",
            "YEAR 2": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness by phone on 1/28/12.  I asked about the knocking sounds and if the source could have been turning toward him then away, making it seem like the sound was closer and then farther.  He believes the source was actually moving quickly away and then back while knocking branches together. He noted how the sound varied like hitting a knot in the wood but the interval was consistant at a very close 2 second interval.When he exited the trailer the knocking ceased at the farthest distance however the whoops came in quick succession from the direction he shined the light which was the closer proximity of the knocking sound.  This supported his feeling that there were more than one animal out there.Obviously this witness has given this incident alot of thought and consideration trying to find some other explanation for what he experienced. He believes as others have come to believe that there is an unknown intelligent species out there. ",
