            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke at length with the witness by phone. Her sighting occurred in 1999 a little ways east of the town of Brimley. She and I attempted to find the road she was on, she stated that right after she had her sighting, there was a motel nearby but not sure exactly where that was and that it was a rather remote stretch of road. She left her home in Houghton around 11pm and was returning to school at Lake Superior State University. It was a Sunday night/ Monday morning.  She first spotted the animal standing on the edge of the road and started slowing down. She stated the animal looked in her direction and walked across the road.  She slowed and watched it, but did not stop. She described it as being around five foot six inches to five foot nine inches tall and dark reddish brown in color.  The animal walked with a loping gait and was slightly hunched over.  She stated several times that it had very long arms that swung while walking and once she approached in her car, it never stopped.  She did not get a clear look at the face but said it looked dark in color.  She stated her tire blew just a minute or two later, which unnerved her even more. She continued on to the town of Brimley, where she spent the night in her car until she could repair her tire in the morning and continue on to school.I found the witness straight forward and honest and she stated that at the time she had no idea what she was looking at, as she did not know what a sasquatch was. It was years later when she seen programs on tv and realized what she had seen. This area is part of the Hiawatha National Forest and has numerous creeks, small lakes, rivers and thick forest that would provide cover and numerous food opportunities. ",
