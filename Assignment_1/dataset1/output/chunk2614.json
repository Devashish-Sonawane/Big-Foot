            "Observed": "I was hunting with a friend for wild boar in the Los Padres National Forest near Lake Cachuma, Ca.  The lake runs on sort of an angle from west/northwest to east/southeast.  Just above the lake when travelling north on hwy 154 is an access road leading into the forest to a point near the northwest end of the lake (probably about 2 1/2 miles from the lake).  Near that point and about 3/4 to one mile away from the ranger station located there, my friend and I hunted along the west side of the road.  We were both armed with high powered rifles (I had a 300 H&H Magnum with 200 grain roundnose bullets).  This is rough country!  We were sitting on a hillside looking down the hill when we noticed what seemed to be movement.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone on 12/20/05.  The following details can be added to his report:\u0095 The movement that was initially noticed was about 100 yards away.\u0095 There was very little cover available on the hill, but there was very thick cover nearby.  \u0095 The footprints indicated that the maker was traveling west (more or less) along the trail, the same direction as the two hunters when they walked into this area.\u0095 The prints had to be made in the ten minutes the hunters were investigating the movement down slope from the trail.  \u0095 The print length was estimated based on the witness\u0092 foot length.  The witness has 12 inch boots, and these prints were \u0093half again as long\u0094.  \u0095 The witness estimates that the prints were 4.5 inches wide at the heel, and 5.5 inches wide at the toes.  He was struck by the \u0093straightness\u0094 of the print, with very little narrowing over the length.  He noted that it seemed like a flat foot made the impression.  There was no visible arch.\u0095 The toes were described as being nearly all of equal size.  There were no claw marks.  They seemed short and stubby, making round or slightly oval impressions in the dust.  The witness commented that they seemed \u0093close up to the foot\u0094.  \u0095 The step length (left foot to right foot) was estimated at between 38 and 40 inches.\u0095 There was very little center straddle between the prints.  In other words, the prints traveled in nearly a straight line.  \u0095 The witness followed the tracks west down the trail, knowing that whatever it was that made those prints only had a five or ten minute head start.  He followed it with the intent of shooting it.  \u0095 The witness did not initially equate the footprints with Bigfoot, having never really considered the possibility of such a creature existing..  It was several years before he came to this conclusion.  He just knew the print maker was large and bipedal.  \u0095 The witness is a Vietnam veteran who had high level military clearance.\u0095 The witness didn\u0092t want to talk about this event for many years.  He said he finally reported it because it had been gnawing at him for so long. ",
