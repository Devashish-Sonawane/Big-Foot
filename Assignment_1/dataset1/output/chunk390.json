The following details can be added to the report.--The witness is a regular hunter.--The witness saw the creature from about 30 yards and they stared at each other for several minutes.--The witness got a good look at the creature from the waist up.  The creature had large shoulders and large arms.  It was covered in long black hair.  Its head was round and its face flat.  There was no hair on the face from the lips up.  The face was leathery and ape like, and the skin was black.  Its eyes were very dark.--There was no smell of any kind.--After the creature left, the witness went to the area where the creature was sitting and sat in the same location, trying to get a better feel for what the creature had been doing.  After a few minutes, the witness then followed the creature a ways into the forest, but it got too thick so he left.--The witness and his dad were supposed to stay the night that evening, but after the event, they decided to go home.--Hair sample is from Kings Canyon/Hume Lake area and the witness is mailing it to me.  I will update the report after the analysis is completed.",

Me and my brother were driving South (me behind the wheel) on Hwy 85 about 7 miles south of Crestview Florida at 1:30am when we spotted what at first we thought was a really big black bear on the side of the road (West shoulder) next to the woods. I decided to make a U-turn at the next open medium to get a better look as big bear sightings in this area are not all that common; Usually they are very small black bears. We took a U-turn at an open medium about a 1/2 mile from the initial sighting and started heading back North. We got to the point where we had first seen what we thought was a large bear and started looking across the median for it. My Brother looked to his right and spotted the thing that we had seen. It had apparently crossed the highway putting it now on the East side of the road. When we looked we saw a large upright walking (like a human) black big foot type of creature. It paused, looked like it turned its head toward us, and ran into the woods. It was too large to be a human and it definately was not a bear. I'd guesstimate approx. 8' 6\" to 9' tall.",
