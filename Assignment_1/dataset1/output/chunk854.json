            "Follow-Up Report": "The couples' description is pretty consistent. I spoke with the gentleman for over thirty minutes and found him to be a levelheaded and a thorough reporter of the events he and his wife had. There are very few details to add: The first event happened roughly 150 yards off of the main road and into the forest. He says that he and his wife both \"felt\" the encounter a minute or two before they actually had the \"auditory\" encounter. He feels that the animal possibly used \"infrasound\" as a way to intimidate or convince them to leave the area before it began to growl at them. They both felt a low-level but significant inaudible force being directed at them; something that was felt through their body and affected their middle ear. They then heard a low pitched growl that over the course of a minute grew louder and more intense and more insistent. He says he knows for sure that this wasn't a \"dog, wolf, bear, or cat...this sounded like a very big man\". After this they left the area very upset but also excited. Just over a year later (9-4-06) they stopped in an area close to where they had been before and after giving a few \"whoops\" they heard tree knocks and possible tree breaks accompanied by a \"wet dog\" smell. Shortly thereafter they left the area. ",

I couldnt believe my eyes.  I didnt tell my husband for two days. we also have something like a bedding area it was staying in I do believe. I dont know anything else that would have done that a tree snapped up high.",
