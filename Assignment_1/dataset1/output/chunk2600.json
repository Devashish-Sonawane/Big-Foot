I spoke to both the witness and his daughter by phone. The witness wasn't exactly sure where they were at the time but after some discussion it was determined that they were actually driving down Hwy 97 South at Blewett Pass and not Snoqualmie Pass on I-90 with another passenger when he noticed an animal walking on the right side of the road. The witness slowed the vehicle down and noticed that what he thought was a person was actually an animal walking upright. The vehicle was traveling down hill and the animal was walking uphill. The animal was described as approximately 6 feet tall with an extremely robust build. The arm length was unusually long and the creature was covered in black hair. The headlights of the vehicle flashed on the creature and the eyes reflected red. The animal was approximately 8-10 feet away from the vehicle. The total elapsed time of the sighting was 5 seconds.The passenger of the vehicle during the sighting was not available for an interview. The witness was just giving that person a ride to Seattle. The witness was extremely shocked at seeing something so unusual and was disturbed for many weeks after. The witness stated \"Thought I saw a devil.\" He was extremely fearful and kept mentioning that it looked like Homo Erectus during the interview. He had never heard of Bigfoot or that any type of animal like that even existed. The witness and his daughter seemed like very genuine and honest people. Based on the witness' description, and being a farmer that is not up to date with current culture, having no knowledge of even the idea of an undiscovered animal such as Bigfoot, I believe he had a sighting.",
