            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is an experienced outdoorsman, and an avid hiker; holding a membership to one of the more prominent hiking clubs in the state. He and a friend were dayhiking along the Fiery Gizzard Trail, which the witness had hiked many times before. The two had noticed no other vehicles or hikers in the area when they arrived at the trailhead. After a considerable amount of time and distance had passed, the two had focused completely on finishing the hike, and had stopped conversing with each other on their way back to the trailhead. They began descending deeper into the gorge, which consisted of quite rocky terrain. The sound of their footfalls was dampened greatly as they moved out of the leaf litter onto the rocks. As they moved further down into the gorge, the forest around them erupted into screams and whoops that the witness described as comparable to \"Indian war cries\". The impetus of the sounds was one major scream that had incredible sustain, and seemed to emanate from an animal with a huge lung capacity, followed by several \"whooping cries\" from other individuals in the immediate environment. The vocalizations carried on for a total of four to five seconds, crescendoing into complete silence. The witness estimated that at least two to three individuals were responsible for the vocalizations. The sounds were being generated from within a fifty to one-hundred yard radius of the witness. Neither hiker had any visual contact with whatever was making the sounds. The two finished their hike without any other interruption. These sounds are highly characteristic of sasquatches, in that they serve both as an intimidation to intruders, as well as a warning to each other. These sounds can not be made by any other animal that inhabits the area. Moreover, the possibility of a perpetrated hoax on the hikers is highly unlikely, due to the fact that the terrain is quite difficult to navigate (even on the primary trail), and that there were no signs of other humans using the trail that day. In all likelyhood, the witness and his companion ventured close to a small group of sasquatches that were already in the environment. They were able to do so by being extremely quiet, and therefore relatively uninvasive. At some point, one or more of the sasquatches were alerted to their presence, and vocalized a warning call, both to each other and the intruders. The witness has hiked the trail several times since then, and has heard nothing out of the ordinary. He has also tried mimicking the vocalizations himself in the same area, and confided in me that he couldn't come close to the volume, or sustain that the calls had. The gorge in the area serves as a funnel for running water sources, as well as wildlife. The terrain would be inviting to large, evasive mammals; in that it lends itself to strategic movement and avoidance of humans. ",

Mitchell is the highest peak east of the Mississippi River at 6,684 feet, and as a result, the mountain gets heavy snowfalls well into March and sometimes April. There had been some heavy snowfall in the weeks preceding our drive, and there were some deep snowdrifts piled up alongside the road, although the road had only a dusting of light snow on its surface. Almost no one goes up on the mountain in the wintertime, and as I remember it, we had to skirt our way around a barricade to even get on the road to the summit.",
