            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness and he recounted the events of his experience in detail. I found the witness to be very believable. He stated his reluctance to file his report for fear that he would not be taken seriously. The witness stated that he was confused by what he was experiencing because he felt the location was too close to human activity for any type of Bigfoot encounter. He was not aware that historically there have been other reports of Bigfoot activity in the general area where he lives. The witness was reluctant to enter the river bottom after his experience and was still reluctant to enter with me accompanying him.We spent about five hours walking the river bottom near his home where the events took place. The witness pointed out the area where he felt something was watching him and throwing small objects like rocks and sticks at him. I scrambled up to the top of the ridge where the objects were coming from and found a slightly discernable trail leading down the ridge to the river bottom. I found no other trace evidence on the ridge. There is plenty of cover and concealment in the area for wildlife to hide undetected by nearby hikers or fishermen. The North Fork of the Nooksack River experiences several salmon and steelhead runs during the course of any given year. At current, a run of steelhead are migrating to their spawning grounds further up river. The area is popular with local fishermen. We found plenty of signs from beaver and deer as well and saw numerous ducks rise up from the backwater sloughs and beaver ponds. There were abundant Chinook and Chum salmon carcasses deposited from recent flooding. We also found a number of trees in a single location freshly marked by a cougar.The witness later contacted me to state that on a recent evening while out enjoying some fresh air, he saw the cougar cross the road near his house. He also stated that he has continued to hear occasional wood knocks and vocalizations off in the distance late in the evening coming from a southern direction. He described the vocalizations as being \"just like the 1978 Snohomish recording on the BFRO website\".Additional note: The witness continues to experience some strange activities that could be attributed to possible Bigfoot activity. I have visited the witness on a number of occasions and find him to be credible. I am currently working with the witness in an attempt to gain additional corroborating evidence. ",

            "Observed": "Me and my friend Aaron were at my uncles house, we were on the back porch playing darts. We started to notice that there was a lot of meteors. We stepped into the back yard to get a better view. We were facing towards the front yard, I was looking up when I noticed something move out of the corner of my eye, I looked and there was a creature around 5 foot tall running through the front yard, from left side of the yard to the right side, it was not large like most reports, it had muscle definition, black or dark brown hair, no neck ,no hair on the face, chest and stomach area, inside of the arms or palms of the hands. It was going at a slow jog, then it must of smelt or heard us. It slowed down, turning its head while slowing down. then it stopped looked at us for around 3 to 4 seconds. Then it ran towards the dark area of the yard, it ran so fast no man can run that fast. I sat there thinking what was that, I was quiet for a while, I didn't want to say anything and sound crazy, hey i just saw a Bigfoot. I looked at my friend Aaron, he had a strange look on his face and he was shaking his head,he looked at the same spot in the yard. I asked did you see something? He replied yes. I then asked did it look like it was on two legs running up right. He replied yes, then my heart really skipped a beat, not only did I just see something , but my friend did to. My uncle did not see the creature, he said yaw didn't see anything yaw just messing with me. After that we went inside, nothing else happened, we continued to talk about what we had saw . My uncle said that we are crazy.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with this witness on numerous occasions these details can be added:\u0095 The approximate viewing distance was 30 yards. Length of observation: 20 to 25 seconds. The creature was first seen in a slightly hunched over jog. It slowed down, possibly as it detected the witness, and came to a complete stop. The creature did not have much of a neck and it pivoted at the waist to look at him. The witness reported that it never looked aggressive but rather had a surprised look on its face. It looked at the witness for several moments.\u0095 The creature rapidly covered 75 yards in a matter of seconds. The witness commented multiple times on the speed, agility, and distance that it covered stating that no man could possibly do what he witnessed the creature do that night.\u0095 These details can be added to the creature\u0092s description: Height of five feet, possibly taller. Weight approximately 175lbs. Its face was small for the size of its head. The eyes were small, with a turned up nose. Its forehead stuck out slightly just above the eyes. Ears were not observed. It was stocky and muscular and gave him the impression that it was very strong. It had very wide shoulders and a large flat chest that did not taper at the waist. Its thighs were \u0093huge\u0094 and its arms were long. It had thick, black hair that did not look matted or nasty. The hair was generally 2\u0094 in length all over. Its skin was dark where the hair was thinner on the face, chest, inside arms, palms, and stomach. It had the smell of wet dog combined with the strong smell of a skunk.\u0095 Large sticks have been thrown against the house. Patio furniture has been thrown against the back door and grunts have been heard. A week after I spoke to the witness he reported that a friend of his had stepped outside to smoke a cigarette when he heard a low guttural growl that was felt as much as heard. When his friend walked around the corner where he had heard the growl, something ran rapidly away through the darkness. Activity increases in the cooler winter months.\u0095 This artists sketch was created using feedback from the witness who said it is very close to what he saw that night.",
