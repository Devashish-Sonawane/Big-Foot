It was tall and it walked away from us and it hollered again.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness and husband walked out into their yard one evening in December and smelled a skunk smell coupled with red eyes. At that point they didn\u0092t give it a second thought. The next night they walked down the country road for about a mile. At this point they came upon an 8 foot tall creature with brown and gray fur. The creature hollered and growled at them, then just walked away. As it walked into the fog it hollered at them once more.Since then they have seen what was probably a male 8-9 foot tall, a female about 8 foot tall with breasts, a small juvenile about 4 foot tall, along with one about 5 foot tall. The little one was seen cupping its hand to drink from the fish pond. The neighbors have seen the same creatures and have heard howls twice in recent weeks. There has also been several possible wood knocks heard in the area. The family has had activity as far back as the 1990's. The husband has seen one look into the kitchen window.  On January 25, BFRO Investigators went to the site to interview this family in person. The site is rural, quite a distance from any towns. On site we asked and investigated the recent sighting and the details. All the neighbors and the witness have pole lights that could make it possible to see in the road, since that night there would have been little or no moon. Also, there is the Florida white sand around to reflect any light. Its a farm community with pastures, some woods, pine farms and several power-line cuts. The property itself has a lot of objects that a large creature could hide behind, including tall uncut grass.  On our night hike in the area we saw deer and several small animals along one of the power cuts. This is a very noisy area, we could hear a band playing at the local bar, dogs barking, chickens crowing, and every once in a while we could hear what sounded like howls. Also, some possible whoops and knocks. Hard to tell with all the noise. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.The area he visits is just east of the Colville National Forest in the Kaniksu National Forest. On September 3, 2017 he found two tracks about thirteen inches long and four to five inches wide, 1 1/2 inches deep in dried mud. They were four feet apart, heading uphill out of a dry creek bed. He could see a big toe and separated/spaced toes but no claws. He mentioned that it looked like a human foot with five toes. The tracks were not aligned.When he was back at the vehicle and still daylight, he did several howls mixed with several tree knocks. The knocks were always a sequence of three. There was no response. Then at dusk, he did another howl and within five seconds a three second long howl came from the southeast about 100 yards away. He did another howl. About ten to fifteen minutes later, a howl came from the east. This one sounded different as was higher pitched. After submitting this report, he returned in October, 2017, he is unsure what day. This time he was a couple miles farther east. Nothing happened but when he returned to this spot one week later, he found broken trees all around.  He is six foot three inches tall and some trees were broken one to one and one-half feet above him. A couple were broken waist high. See photos:After dark, 7:30 to 8:00 pm, he did some howls and knocks. No vocalizations were heard. About 45 minutes later while sitting around the campfire, a baseball sized rock landed six feet away from the witness.I find the witness very observant. He looks forward to returning to the area in the Spring of 2018. ",
