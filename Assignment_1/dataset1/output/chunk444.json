            "Observed": "While waiting (not knowing my son had been injured and was taken to Orlando Hospital) I was inside the camper and had lowered the tent flaps slightly to allow air flow. The opening would have been approx. 7 feet off the ground.  I suddenly heard the loudest breathing right outside the opening. I became very frightened and screamed, \"get out of here!\". Just about that time a ranger pulls in with my husband and son.  The shock (I fainted) of seeing my son made me forget this incident. We are huge BFRO fans. After watching stories of sightings, my memory was jarred. This thing had to be 7 or 8 feet tall and huge. After recalling this, I don't believe I would camp there again.  My grandson encouraged me to file this report as we have been reading the BFRO website reports. Better late than never.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness extensively on the phone, about her experience.  Towards the end of August in 1983, she, her husband, and three children stayed at Fort Wilderness at Disney World for a week. Being that the weather in Orlando in August averages in the high 90\u0092s with 60%+ humidity, there were not many campers present.  She remembers the camp site was in the 1500 site of Cottontail Curl. The site was surrounded in sand and the back of their camper faced the canal. (See photo)  They had a pop-up type wheeled camper that had a peak of approximately 8 ft. high and zippered windows at the top. She also remembers how dark the camp ground was as it didn\u0092t have any artificial lighting at the sites.One night, while her husband and son were at the hospital, her daughters (aged 2 & 4) stayed in the camper as night approached. The mother zipped the two windows down about a foot, trying to get the air to circulate better within the tent.  Around 9:00 PM, after the girls had gone to sleep, she was startled by a loud \u0093heavy breathing \u0096 growl\u0094 outside the window.  The sound was so deep and scary, she yelled to it, \u0093Get out of here!\u0094  The sound stopped immediately, and the girls woke up.  She knew it wasn\u0092t a person, but could not identify what kind of animal it could have been. Recently, she has been watching the Finding Bigfoot series, and is more aware that it could have been a Bigfoot. The sound had come from up high (about 7 feet) by the unzipped window nearest the water, so whatever had made the noise, would have to have been very tall. There were no trees by the camper, thus eliminating that it could have been something in a tree.  The family stayed two more nights that proved to be quiet. The witness believes that a Bigfoot had been looking into the camper watching her and the children. Walt Disney World opened in 1971 and is 30,500 acres (47 square miles) and only 7,000 acres are developed. Although over 200,000 people are on Disney property daily, there are huge forested and green areas that the public cannot trespass. Plenty of water, deer, turkey, and wildlife are present, making it very possible that Sasquatch inhabit the property.  8,200 acres of the land owned by Walt Disney World will never be developed because it is a designated wildlife preserve.Google earth image of the area:Photo taken from the camp site, looking across the water.",

The lanes are separated by a wide grass median, maybe 50 feet wide that serves as a drainage feature for the highway. It was September 29, 2012. The time was about 8 pm and it was dark and raining a little. The sighting occurred about a quarter mile east of the junction of 339 and 27. My truck has loose steering and it drifted a little almost going into the grass median. A large creature jumped up from a squatlike stance like it was startled and raised its arms over its head. It ran on two legs to the north across the highway. The creature was brownish/reddish color and very muscular. It was between 7 and 8 feet tall. We could only see the back of the creature because it ran away from us and we were past it in an instant. We turned around but it was already gone. We heard no noise or sound from the creature.",

This stretch of road between Chiefland and Bronson is particularly dark with woods close by on both sides of the highway. The witness says he sees a lot of road kill here regularly. His small pickup had just drifted over the yellow line in the left lane so he was just 5 ft from the crouched figure at the closest point. When they first noticed it, they had the impression it may have been eating something as it was crouched over with its back to them. Within a second, the animal jumped straight up and threw its arm above it head, then took a couple of bounds, and was off and running. The witnesses' observations included long and muscular arms (past the knees). Very dark brown hair that appeared wet and stringy. It was much wider in the shoulder area than a man (like a football player), and when it rose up, it appeared to be between 7 and 8 1/2 feet tall. Both witnesses said this animal was huge, and ran on two legs. They  turned the car around to get another look at it, but it was already gone.",
