The caller refused to give his name on grounds the officers would think he was crazy.  The man's companion, also declining to give his name, said he had seen tracks of the monster. \"If we could get these people to come in or call and tell us just what they did see, we could make a lot more sensible approach to this thing,\" Huntley noted.  \"We would listen with reason and wouldn't put them in a strait jacket.  If they did see a thing of the description, it's important to the community, the sheriff's office and everyone concerned.\" Sardella feels the creature spotted Sunday night was a bear.  \"This the first year I can remember we haven't had snow in the mountains by this time,\" he notes.  \"Those animals are nervous and hungry.  They're usually hibernating by November.\" The noise heard by Huntley and reserve Deputy Elbert Miller, Sardella said, could have been made by an owl or a mountain lion.",
