But as he slowed his car, he was closer to 30 feet as it walked down the embankment to the creek. He added that he did not see its front side.  It walked past the stop sign and down the hill into the creek bed.  The one thing that stood out when he saw it was the width of this animal.  It was very broad.  And that it had very large gluteal muscles. I was able to visit this location when I had to drive through for work. Great area.  The brush it walked into was very thick. ",

At 6.20 in the morning I heard loud footsteps walking through the pasture off to my right shoulder. I thought it was another hunter going to the third pasture to his ground blind. I stood up to see what was making the loud footsteps. What I saw was something large and hairy with a huge stride in its steps. Walking very quickly like it knew where it was going I would estimate it to be 6 to 7 feet tall. I was freaked out. The other hunter always wears blaze orange when he walks to his spot. I saw he and his son go by my stand that day at 11.30 am.",
