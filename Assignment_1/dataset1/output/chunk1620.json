            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length on November 20th and found him to be very credible.  He has a very strong recollection of the day in question, even after 28 years.  This event made a very lasting impression.  After speaking with the witness the following details can be added:- When the bigfoot dashed into the road the uncle who was driving slammed on the brakes so hard that the truck spun 360 degrees and then slid sideways, stopping approximately 10 feet from the startled creature.  - The witness had the distinct impression that this was an adolescent.  He remarked several times that although very muscular the animal was thin without much bulk.  - The witness noted the following details:   - Extremely large eyes - he compared them to the way      we 'flare' our eyes when in shock.   - The nose was flatter than a human nose.   - The hair coat was dark brown to black and the hair was     long with most of it appearing to be 6\" long or longer.   - The animal appeared to be as startled as the witness and      its mouth was open in an \"O\" shape.   - Whatever the animal was holding (it appeard to be      clothing) was hanging at hip level in a gangly left arm.   - The height was estimated as \"the height of a door\" which     would be approximately 7 ft.   - The weight was estimated at 200 - 220 lbs.   - The hands were very large and the large fingers were      articulated.

It sat on all fours with its rear end down and its front end higher, kind of like a gorilla. It ran, then stopped and looked at me for a few seconds, then ran away. It ran in the same manner it was setting, on all fours with the front end highest. It never stood on its hind legs. The rear legs definitely seemed shorter than the front. It was dark brown in color and covered in hair. The hair seemed to be short. On all fours it stood about 21/2 or three feet tall.",

He is a lifelong resident of the area and does not believe in a local \u0093skunk ape\u0094 or Bigfoot type creature. He believes his sighting to be an escaped or released exotic ape or monkey. He did not get a good look at any facial detail. He described the creature as being \u0093thick through the shoulders\u0094.  No tail was observed, but since the sighting was in a grassy area it may not have been visible even if present. The area of this sighting is in close proximity to Report #721 and Report #7205..",
