The hair was shaggy around the squarish shaped head.  As such she was only able to clearly see the eyes and could not see any other facial details.  She was able to make out portions of its shoulders, arms and legs.  The animal did not move as she watched it.  When she spoke with her mother and looked back towards the animal it was gone.  ",
