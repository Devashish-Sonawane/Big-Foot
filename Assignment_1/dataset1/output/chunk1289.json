            "Follow-Up Report": "Note by Matt Moneymaker (chief editor):The elements of this Iowa report that make it a possible bigfoot-related incident (rather than just a possible horse or cow in the reeds) and thereby justifying its inclusion in this database of possible bigfoot-related incidents:1)  Proximity to the Des Moines River. This river basin has a history of reported sightings extending back several decades, at  least. The zone is rich with well fed deer herds.2) The correlation with two other visual sightings nearby, reported in the local newspaper at the time.---------------------------------------------------------------------Comments by Iowa BFRO investigator Steve MoonI spoke with the witness on the phone on two occasions and found him to be very credible. He relived the experience from thirty years ago as though it was yesterday, and added a remarkable amount of vivid detail about the incident. A day later I interviewed the reporting witness' mother, who also could recall the incident. I found her equally credible and her account of the incident equally compelling. Although the area where the incident took place is urban it is situated on the edge of a broad river valley which is extremely wild. The Des Moines River is the largest river of interior Iowa. There have been many sasquatch related incidents reported along the central portion of the river where this incident took place, as well as along the lower reaches of the river in southeast Iowa. The following information is from an interview with the reporting witness:In the Spring of 1980 the witness had a new puppy, 'Gus', who was not well, and as a result the witness was not sleeping well. If he heard Gus whimpering he would get up. Gus was in the basement of the house. At about 1:30 or 2:00 he heard Gus whining. He then heard the two big dogs from down the street. He got up and found his mom in the kitchen looking out the back window toward the corn field and swamp. Something had awakened his mom by walking close to the house. Neighbors next door also had their lights on and were watching. The kitchen window and back yard faced west toward the swamp. It was about 70 feet to the field from their house, and then there was a fence another 120 to 200 feet beyond that, with dried cat tails, storm damaged trees and a small swamp with open water. The big dogs from down the street that were in their back yard that night were viscous to the point of being feral, and had the run of the neighborhood. Their owners typically made no attempt to control them. There was about a 130 lb. great dane mix, and Primo was about a 70 lb. German shephard-husky mix. The dogs were running back and forth together from the light in the back yard of the witness' house out to the fence on the far side of the corn and back. When the dogs were up by the house they were quiet, listening and looking at a point in the darkness. You could hear something crunching reeds beyond the light. You could tell from the sound and from where the dogs were looking where the animal was. At the time the witness and his mom weren't thinking bigfoot, but horse. But it didn't sound like a four legged animal. His mom made the point that it sounded really heavy and walked like a man, making a \"crunch, crunch, crunch\" sound. The dogs seemed horrified. They would run into the dark, and then would instantaneously scream as though hit by something. When the dogs charged into the darkness you couldn't hear a strike by the animal, but the dogs would go from a growling attack to a shriek, like both dogs were struck hard simultaneously. Then they would be back into the light right away. The witness reported that it was the sort of sound you hear when a dog is hit by a car. This happened eight or ten times. The dogs wouldn't take their eyes off of the animal the whole time, and they were looking in different places each time they came back to the light as the animal moved. It was unnerving to the witness and his mom.The fence beyond the corn field enclosed the swamp, and there was an opening on the north end of it that was about 60 feet long and one on the south end that was about ten or twelve feet long, with sections of fence laying on the ground. The fence was a typical woven field fence that came up to about chest high on the witness. The animal was moving back and forth on the other side of this fence, moving as though it was lost. The dogs would run to different places to attack each time. They were acting like feral animals. There were no smells, and no sounds from the animal other than the heavy crunching. The witness's school chum lived next door, and his dad was a hunter and sort of a river bottom guy. This animal had the friend's dad confused. He had no idea what it might be. The houses and swamp were on the edge of the Des Moines River valley, which is very wide and quite wild at this point. There were people who lived in shacks along the river there, and police would go there to find bodies when there were murders, that sort of thing. It was a notorious place, and still is. The area had a reputation for strange things going on, and there was a story of a swamp monster that lived down there that was called \"orange eyes\". The witness's grandfather had lived along the Des Moines River and farmed back in the 1920s and 1930s, and he reported that he had never seen anything like that. But it was an unnerving area. You can still get lost real easily down there because it's so overgrown, and at the time of this incident it was much worse. On the edge of the valley, in the neighborhood, there was a dirt road that went between two schools, Woodside Middle School and Saydel High School, and the witness and his friends were scared whenever they walked it. The witness and his friend were terrified about going back to the swamp after the incident, but did go back on their dirt bikes about a week later. They found a noticeable path on the swamp side of the fence. About 400 yards or so southwest of the house there was about an 8 by 8 or 10 by 10 foot area that was all mashed down that led to speculation. No foot prints were found, but it was not the sort of place where foot prints would show. A few weeks later at Cherry Glenn Park, not too far north, a park worker saw a bigfoot standing next to a shelter. It's head was as high as the low part of the roof, so it was about eight feet tall. There was also a sighting on I-80 by a truck driver outside of a nearby community at about the same time.I interviewed the mom, and she provided the following details about the incident:She heard something large walking past her bedroom window, which faced south. The walking was in the corn, about 50 feet away. You could hear the corn stalks crunching. It was very heavy sounding. It was like a two legged animal. It made a straight bee-line past the window toward the corn and tree line on the west side of the house. It made big strides with heavy steps, but there were no other sounds. It startled her, and she turned on the back light. She and her son stood and listened to the dogs. The animal would stop in one place, the dogs would strike, circle back, then after a while the animal seemed to move. It went on for about an hour. It was shocking. The previous Fall and Winter of 1979 had been strange. A woman saw a bigfoot looking in the window of her kitchen near Van Meter, which is to the west, on the other side of the Des Moines River. The window was quite high, so the animal had to be huge. There were several sightings at that time. There were five or six sightings in the Spring of 1980. Her son's friends' grandfather worked for the Sheriff's Department and had lots of stories. Her dad told stories. He saw a creature down by the river that looked like a cross between a bear and something else.",
