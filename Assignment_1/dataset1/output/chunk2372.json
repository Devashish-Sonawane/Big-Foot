            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness has worked in the woods and is an avid off-roader that spends many hours each year in the woods in some very remote areas. The witness hunts on a large family owned private parcel within 1/8th mile of thousands of square miles of Escanaba River State Forest. The family has owned the land for around 10 years and on several occasions has heard wood knocks, tree falls, howls and samurai chatter. The area is relatively remote considering its proximity to the towns Escanaba, Bark River and Cedar River. The calls heard are very similar to the calls that James \"Bobo\" Fay does on Finding Bigfoot except they were a lower tone and last a few seconds longer. The knocks heard before the howling were to the northwest of the hunting blind while the howling seem to come from a sand pit area to the west/southwest about 3/4 mile away. I visited the sand pit area with the witness and was shown around the property. According to the witness the knocking and vocalizations start every year around April and will continue through the year until just after the firearm deer season ends on November 30th. It is also worth noting that this are a has a high population of wolves, high enough that the DNR has signs posted on the trees warning hunters. The following pictures are what 70% of the land looks like.",

He could also hear a low grunt. He referred to the head as being pointed. When the witness's brother woke up, he made a slight noise that got the creature to turn around. In doing so, the witness saw the profile of the creature; it had a flat face and was hunched over. The witness and his brother ran down stairs to the back door and saw that the creature was covered in black hair with brown tips walking away. They hit the glass on the back door and the creature stopped and looked around. The animal then continued to walk off. This took place in the outskirts of town; there were other houses around.",
