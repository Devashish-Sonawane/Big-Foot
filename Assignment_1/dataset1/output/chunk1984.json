            "Observed": "In June of 2005 my family had a strange occurance.  My son and a couple of his friends wanted to camp out down in the woods.  My husband and one of the other boys' dad went down to check on them before we went to bed.  It was a full moon out and they were sitting down there with the boys when my husband saw something move between the trees.  He wasnt sure what it was and kept watching when he seen it move between the trees again he could see the moonlight between its legs.  They got scared and came up out of the woods.  Of course I didnt beleive him so the next day I went down there and found footprints.  One was a really good one that we actually poured a mold of.  Upon further scouting I found some odd things.  There was a bunch of little pieces of tree bark in a circle and it looked and felt like something might have been chewing on it.  We found moss rolled back, not tore up just rolled back.  And we also found tree limbs stuck in the ground kinda like markers.  Our friends didnt believe us so one nite we got a bunch of us together and went down in the same place my husband first saw it.  I had been interested so I did some research on the internet and took a little hand held recorder and recorded what was suppose to be bigfoot screams.  Around dusky dark my husband started playing the screams on the recorder he played them a few times and then all of a sudden we heard the god awfullest scream we've ever heard. It was high pitched and drawn out.  Everyone was shocked.  I dont know what it was but it wasnt too long after that, that a log, about the size of a piece of firewood came down out of the woods and landed by my vehicle.  After everyone got calmed back down we were standing around the fire when I thought I saw something just outside of the fire lite walking toward the creek.  I went and got back in my truck and about 2 minutes later it sounded like it picked up a creek rock and slammed it back down.  We all left after that.  The next weekend it was around midnite when my husband, my son and a couple of friends drove my truck back down there.  Without a fire it was really dark, they had a spotlight and my husbands' friend was just randomly shineing it through the woods when at the same time my husband and another person in the vehicle said, \"there it is\" so he brought the light back to the spot where they seen it, my husband instantly started the truck up and his friend told him to shut it off and when he did they could hear it running through the woods.  They said it was just trashing it way up the hill.  But they saw it when he brought the light back down through the woods, it was behind a tree and they said it had red eyes.  Another odd thing was that all the grass was laid down flat kinda like in swirls.  And there is nothing down there that would lay it down flat.  I've seen deer bedding before but this was a large area that was flat by the creek.  We still go back there sometimes and we haven't seen anything or any signs like we did that year.  Everyone thinks we are crazy which I probably would too if I hadn't experienced it for myself.  Anyways thanks for taking the time to read this sorry its a few years late but it came up in conversation again and I wanted to share my story.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and found her to be credible.  Although the witness observed a wide range of unusual activity, she had no sustained view of the creature. However, she measured the footprint cast at eighteen inches. The husband and wife described the animal as about seven feet tall with wide shoulders, a cone shaped head, and no neck. The apparent red eyes were thought to be a reflection from the white spotlight. A  unusual circle of apparently chewed bark was laid out on the ground.  Apes often chew bark to obtain minerals.  The use of a bright white spotlight probably accounts for the cessation of observable activity in the area.",

            "Observed": "This incident occurred in early September 2012. Bear hunting season had just begun in Minnesota and I was running a few bait stations. It was maybe 07:20 in the morning when I left my house to go to my first bait station. I have never harvested a bear and this was my most promising bait station I had. It was hit every single day from the first day it was legal to bait. I had a trail camera on this bait station the week before season for a few days so I had an idea of when the bear were coming in and the general direction they were coming from. The morning was beautiful, cool and the sun was just over the horizon. This is my favorite time of day because it seems this is when the woods \u0093come alive\u0094. I turn off the dirt road and start down the logging trail. My bait station was located about 150 yards through the brush. The area holds a bunch of mature poplar mixed with a few maple and balsam trees. As I was sitting at the fork about to get out of the truck I was looking down the left trail, \u0093which over time was widened out a bit by trying to avoiding the muddy areas\u0094 when I saw it. It came across the trail fast. It was about 50-60 yds from me and if I hadn\u0092t been looking at that second I would have never saw it. Most stories about \u0093Bigfoot\u0094 are that he is brown or black\u0085 well whatever this was was big and gray/white in color. I kind of sat there for a second, shook it off and told myself, \u0093No, I was imagining things\u0094. So I get out of my truck and go to grab my bait bucket when I could hear it running through the brush towards my bait station distinctively on 2 legs. I\u0092ve bow hunted my entire life so I know the sound a 4 legged animal makes when it runs or trots.  I realized that I was not imagining things and that it really just happened. I promptly climbed back in my truck and left. Even though my goal for many years was to harvest a bear I was too shook up to return to that bait station. All bait stations are required to have your information affixed within a certain distance of the bait station. So I knew I had to return to the bait station to get my sign. A few weeks later I had a good friend of mine come out there with me. We retrieved my sign and left. This was the last time I was in that area.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness has been a hunter his entire life, recently starting to hunt bears. While visiting his bear bait stand, he clearly saw a whitish-grey, 8-9' tall creature cross the path at only 50-60 yards in front of him. He does not believe the creature was fleeing, but heard his approaching truck. It stayed on 2 feet while moving, took 2 steps to cross the two-track he was on, and was deliberate. The footsteps were bipedal and made resounding \"Boom-Boom-Boom\" noises as it moved. He saw it for 3 - 4 seconds, then heard it going away from him for several more. He described it as \"blocky in build, not skinny like a human, thick and stocky in the shoulders and neck,  and it seemed powerful\". When he was 16 years-old and hunting, he also heard a possible Bigfoot near him. It knocked 3 times, and he heard response knocks in the distance. He heard something very heavy walking by him, and he was quite afraid.",
