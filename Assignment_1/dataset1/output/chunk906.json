No other details could be seen because the flashlight mentioned was a small LED headlamp and there was very little moonlight on this evening.The eyes were very large and shined similar to other wild animals with a yellow/green hue. The 2nd witness said that after they shined the large flashlight from the shed and saw nothing, they retreated to the shed to regroup and retrieve a loaded 357.  They stayed in the shed for a few minutes because he wasn't sure his 357 would be enough for an animal that tall.  He has lived, hunted and camped in this area and has never seen an animal that could have stood this tall, including moose.The freezer door is large and very heavy.  The night was calm and clear.  There was no wind to speak of and for a wind to slam the door it would have to be very strong, witness suggested 60 mph.  The freezer door had never slammed on them before or after.",
