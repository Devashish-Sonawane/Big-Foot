            "Follow-Up Report": "AC and I talked tonight, December 30, 2005, about his incident  this past summer.  He and his kids were interested with the bigfoot/sasquatch subject so they went to the museum at Willow Creek to ask the folks there about it. They also spoke with a forest ranger they met while camping. The ranger relayed some interesting stories about the \"ape-people\" said to inhabit the local mountains.I asked AC about the large branches they found laid across the trail. He emphasized that the branches were really large, and seemed to have been torn from some pine trees and other large trees that had a grey type of bark. The trees that the branches were pulled off of were some distance away from where they were laying across the trail.  It was as if something was trying to block the trails. He said those trails lead up into the forest behind the camp site. I asked if it was possible that the whooping and clicking sounds were made by the other campers. He doubts that because the sounds \"started right behind us, and they were way too loud to have been a person.\" He said he really tightened up when they first started hearing sounds.\u0094I asked how he knew something big jumped or stepped off of something. He said \u0093It was just a loud thud type of sound, like something very large would have had to have made. It made that sound just before they left the area.\u0094 I asked about the clicking and popping sounds. He said the sounds \"sounded like a tongue would make against the roof of your mouth or maybe with the lips.\u0094I asked about tracks. He said they looked for tracks the following day, but the ground was just too hard to find anything.AC stated that when he and the kids got home, they went to the BFRO web site and listened to the whoop recording from the Sierras. It was similar to what they heard. ",

            "Observed": "I was walking with my dog down a dirt road near my grandparents house. It was about 8pm and still light out. We were about 1/2 mile down the road when my dog started barking and going crazy. She would just stand between my legs and growl and bark, this is a big dog, a German Shepard. Finally I got her to calm down. I heard some grunting and moving around in the woods to our right, I figured it was a deer or wild hog. As I moved closer, I saw it raise up from behind a fallen tree. I'd say it was roughly 7' tall. I would guess it was 300-400 lbs, kinda reddish brown hair covering its body. Its face looked like a monkey in a way. I couldn't move, my dog was going crazy trying to stay between me and what ever it was. It was only there for a flash. I know it turned and ran off and my dog gave chase to it, and I turned and ran home. About 30-45 minutes later, my dog came home, panting, but unhurt. I have heard all kinds of noises at night there all my life. They sound like a \"whoomping\" sound, kinda like a howler monkey I've seen on the Discovery Channel.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This report was originally submitted to the Texas Bigfoot Research Center.The witness was walking his dog near his grandparents home, located about two miles south and one mile west of Newcastle, OK. His large two-year old dog, described as a good watchdog, started acting frightened, \"going nuts,\" and trying to hide between the witness's legs. He said he couldn't calm her down. The witness then heard a low, deep pitched, sound. He couldn't really describe or imitate it. Staring in the direction of the sound, into the woods on the west side of the road, he noticed an extremely large head, \"as big as or bigger than a basketball,\" looking over the exposed root system of a downed tree. He estimated the distance at thirty yards, and guessed the height of the root ball at six feet. A sasquatch-like creature moved out from behind the roots and retreated into the woods. The witness said he saw the animal's entire body. He said it \"walked like a mall walker\" with swinging arms and a very fluid motion. The animal was described as having very broad shoulders and huge hands, and he said he could see its muscles moving under its hair. The estimated height of the animal was \"seven or eight feet.\" The witness also said he noticed a \"strong road kill\" smell around the time of the sighting, but he didn't know if it was related to the animal he saw. The witness described the animal as being \"rust-colored.\" Upon seeing the animal retreat, the dog became aggressive and broke away from its leash, chasing after the animal. It returned to the house a couple of hours later, unharmed. Speaking of the animal, the witness said, \"It scared the hell out of me. I was frozen.\" The witness said he drew pictures of the creature. When asked if it could have been a bear, the witness shot down the possibility and described being very familiar with bears, having seen and hunted them. The witness works as a loan officer. He appears to be very excited about learning everything he can about sasquatches and said he wants to buy a couple of game cameras to place in the woods near his sighting. Visits to the area revealed the presence of plenty of suitable habitat for concealment associated with the South Canadian River, which is just a few miles away.",
