            "Observed": "Back in 1985-86 my family relocated to Coral Springs from Miami before the Sawgrass Express way was built. We lived so close to the Glades my friends and I used to ride our skateboards to the levy and watch the Everglades burn (at that time, some firebug had set quite a blaze). On some mornings we'd wake to cars and yards covered in ash. Needless to say, a lot of wildlife began to migrate closer to our neighborhood i.e.,deer,alligators, whatever. One night we pitched a tent in my friends back yard approx.  50 yrds from a canal that separated us from an apartment complex and across from that was the beginning of the everglades. The fires had been raging for weeks and people in the area were reporting missing pets, some of which were inside 6 foot privacy fences.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness was interviewed on the afternoon of 4/19/07.  In my opinion he is entirely credible. According to the witness, the police had received reports for several days about a strange prowler seen running between houses and through properties, in the darkness, and possibly looking into windows. He said there were also numerous reports of pets disappearing overnight from fenced yards.He described the deep, agitated, grunting sounds, occurring as something was going through tall, heavy-lidded dumpsters across a canal from where they were camped.As the apparent source of these sounds began to approach their spot, the witness recalls their specific discussion about the footfalls; whether they were from a four legged animal or a two legged animal. They eventually surmised that it must be two legged. He described the steps as distinct and heavy. They were just beginning to speculate that it might be the prowler the police were looking for, when they heard the loud splash, which seemed to be something large beginning to cross the canal, fifty yards away.Their tent was a short distance from the friend's yard. Less than a minute passed between them fleeing to the house from the tent, and his friend\u0092s dad coming out hurredly through the sliding glass door to turn on the backyard light. Soon thereafter the father came out with his shotgun and found the tent \"leveled and covered with mud and water\". The boys felt the animal was still nearby and they did not want him to investigate further that night. The next morning, they saw that the tent had been completely lifted off the ground, with the stakes pulled out of the ground. Some of the contents was strewn about, as if the tent was turned over and shaken out.[Graphic below added by editor MM  -- Please wait for it to load -- Frame from Google Earth showing Coral Springs, the upper Everglades and Alligator Alley.]Click the image below for a larger version.",
