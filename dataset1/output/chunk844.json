            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness by phone on March 17th. I found the witness to be very credible and honest in his report. Since it had only been a week from the incident he was still very emotional about what had happened. The area is located near National Forest property and very close to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.  As stated by the witness, he could not sleep so he got up with his cousin and had turned on the lights to the living room and kitchen.Having viewed pictures of this cabin, it has very large open windows in the living room and kitchen areas that open towards a very large deck.  He stated that they began to hear a \"grunting noise\" and they could not figure out what it was. He proceeded to open the door to the deck and turn on the outside porch lights. Immediately a very loud \"scream\" was heard and they could hear something or somethings running through the woods breaking sticks and limbs.  The scream was so loud that the other members of their group that were sleeping were awakened by the sound.  Within a few minutes,  they begin to hear a \"whooping\" sound from two different directions.  They decided to try the same sound back and got a response call back twice. This really made the group nervous as it responded directly to their attempts to call. The \"whooping\" sounds were heard off and on for about 2 hours until 6:30 a.m. He did make a point of stating that the \"scream\" was a very high pitched scream and very loud.  They had forgotten food items on the porch in a plastic storage bin with a candy bar half eaten on top of it. The food and candy bar were still there, untouched.They did smell a foul odor, \"like old garbage\".This location is high in elevation and very remote that has limited access from the public. ",
