            "Observed": "I was walking along a creek off of the Little Miami River in Loveland Ohio with my dogs and one started acting real funny. I then looked around where she was and I saw a footprint. I took a couple of pictures of it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness, and met him and his teenage son at a local restaurant in Loveland, Ohio.  We discussed the details of their Sasquatch encounter in the report that the witness had submitted, but it quickly became apparent that both he and his son, had much more recent encounters that proved to be very informative and interesting. I followed the witnesses to the location of their late October 2014 encounter, where they showed me the location of the track they had discovered and photographed. When they first arrived to the Little Miami River last fall to do some early morning fishing in a favorite deep water hole, the family dogs started barking and sniffing the ground. At first the witnesses could not figure out why the normally docile dogs were so excited, but then they noticed a track in the mud along the river bed. (See photo 1) The Sasquatch was heading east along the river toward Cones Road (highway 255). The track was fairly small, but distinct toes were visible along with a wider than normal heel. (See photo 2) It is doubtful this was a human track, because being late October 2014 the weather was unusually cold. In addition, the witnesses had fished this section of the river for several years and never observed anyone swimming or walking barefoot in the water at this location before. We all got in my pick-up truck and headed toward Goshen, Ohio where the witness and his parents had an encounter while driving home from his grandparents\u0092 house in early April 1976. It was around midnight and as the family was slowing down to make a turn on Ivy Lane Road, a Sasquatch suddenly appeared in front of the family station wagon, about eight feet away. (See photo 3) The Sasquatch seemed startled, stopped for about 3 \u0096 5 seconds staring into the car\u0092s headlights, shocking both the witness and his parents. It then took two or three steps and disappeared into the woods.  In 1976, the area was not developed and contained very few houses that were blocks apart. This sighting was actually documented in a book titled \u0093Unexplained Mysteries of the 20th Century.\u0094  Also, when he was growing up in the 1960s and 1970s, many of the witness\u0092 family members had heard strange vocalizations throughout the area that seemed both unusual and eerie. We departed this area and drove toward the witness\u0092 family cottage approximately 50 miles, southeast of Goshen, near the Ohio River, and the Ohio-Kentucky border. The witnesses then proceeded to tell me about several Sasquatch encounters that they had experienced on Memorial Day Weekend 2014. Things started to get interesting one morning around 6 a.m. when the witnesses were on the dock fishing. They both observed possible movement and heard vocalizations in the woods approximately 100 yards from them on the other side of the dirt road. (See photo 4) The witness\u0092 son threw a small, flat stone in the direction of the observed activity and within minutes the same rock was thrown back at them cutting the son\u0092s foot. (He was wearing flip-flops and has the scar to prove it!)  They returned to the cottage and bandaged the son\u0092s foot. Later they heard wood knocking and possible movement coming from the road southwest of the cottage and proceeded to investigate. This is when the witnesses noticed a large track in the grass crossing the road and immediately observed the Sasquatch attempting to hide about fifty feet from them in the woods. (See photo 5) After a few minutes, the Sasquatch stood up and retreated out of sight deeper into the woods. The witnesses took several cell phone pictures of the track, but due to light, shadows, and foliage the actual Sasquatch is not readily visible in the photo. (See photo 6)We then drove up to the cottage where the witness\u0092 teenage son had seen a Sasquatch walking along a game trail emerging from the woods, towards the \u0093stink pond\u0094 or small marsh. (See photo 7) He observed the Sasquatch for a few minutes, before it saw him and headed back into the woods.  When all three of us approached the stink pond, we immediately observed large, fresh tracks in the mud and grass, around the stink pond. (See photo 8) Even though the ground was still hard, we were able to distinctly see toes, rough ridges, and a heel from the left foot print.  The track was approximately 16 inches long, 7 inches wide, and about \u00bd to 1 inch deep. (See photo 9) We followed the tracks along the game trail for approximately 150 yards, with the distance between each track being approximately 64 inches or 5.33 feet. The tracks were easy to follow in the grass and mud along the game trail, where we also noticed deer tracks and scat.  One of the witnesses decided to try some wood knocks, and to our surprise we immediately heard wood knocking followed by vocalizations lasting several minutes.  The game trail eventually led to a north-south power line clearing. Both the wood knocks and vocalizations appeared to be coming from the west toward a wooded area in the valley. (See photo 10) We attempted to record the wood knocks and vocalizations, but my cell phone was only faintly able to faintly pick-up part of the vocalizations. After the wood knocking and vocalizations had stopped, we walked back toward the family cottage and discussed what had just happened.  The witnesses informed me that although they have owned this property for several years, Sasquatch activity really pick-up about five years ago.  The man-made ponds are well stocked with large fish, and there is an abundance deer, black berry patches, and water ways that are very capable of supporting a Sasquatch population.  In addition, there are numerous Sasquatch encounters throughout Southwest Ohio, making this a natural hotspot. The Southwest Region of Ohio has numerous Sasquatch encounters and the witnesses are two of the most genuine and interesting individuals that I have encountered during the past two years.",
