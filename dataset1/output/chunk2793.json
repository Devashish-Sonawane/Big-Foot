            "Observed": "On August 30 2012 between 9:07-9:45pm. I was traveling to my father's home in the Moyers area of Pendleton county, WV. I decided to stop along side of a small road, county rt 25 Moyers Gap rd. I stopped half way up Hoover mountian when I heard an unusual howl sounding like three woops (I'm pretty certain it was three). Being familiar with both wild animal sounds and those of farm animals I was startled because I immediately thought of sounds I've heard Bobo make on the show. I cupped my hands around my mouth and attempted to recreate the sound i just heard. I gave three loud woop sounds in medium tempo. After about 5-10 seconds I heard two woop sounds coming from the same direction as the first down over the mountain to my left. Again I cupped my hands and let out two loud woop sounds in about the same tempo as i had just heard. This time I heard a sharp crack of wood and a different type of howl, it sounded angry or frustrated maybe? to me. Unfortunately, a white gmc pick up truck began coming down the mountain. The loud crack and howl were the last sounds I heard that night. I waited for about 45 minutes in the truck I was driving, several times I attempted to get responses by making woop sounds none of my calls were returned again. I was so excited by this encounter. I will never forget it",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After conversing with the witness the following details can be added to his report:The witness estimates the whoops originated at a distance of 150 to 200 yards from his position, and came from a southwesterly direction.The vocals he heard were described as very similar to the vocals captured in this first clip from the Berry-Morehead expeditions of the 1970s, and this second clip from Isabella County, Michigan, in July 2011.After the witness mimicked the whoops with his own voice he was startled to hear another whoop, apparently responding to him.He lingered in the area another forty minutes listening for voices or foot steps. He heard none and saw no flashlights or anything else to indicate a person might be out there in the darkened forest.The witness was previously skeptical of the existence of sasquatch. But this experience, and specifically the response he received, has caused him to reconsider his position.This map locates the position of the witness on Hoover mountain, and the area from which the whoops originated.Hoover mountain and the location of this report are very well known to the investigator who previously hunted the area for many years. It is a heavily forested corner of Pendleton County, adjacent to vast stretches of the George Washington National Forest. Several reports of sasquatch activity have occurred within 10 miles north east of this location, along the VA/WV state line. There are scattered ranches in the area, a few homes concentrated in small villages, and healthy game populations. The region consists of steep mountains and deep ravines that are difficult to navigate and rarely visited. Limestone is part of the local geology and several significant caves exist in the area.",
