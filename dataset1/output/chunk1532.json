            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone and he was able to give me more detail and information about his encounter.Firstly concerning the trail. He said it was a kind of path that connected a neighborhood with a local grocery store. This trail was bordered by woods all around which could provide plenty of cover for a large bipedal creature to come and go without detection. Also, very near the trail where the encounter occurred is the grocery store dumpster, containing thrown out food. This very well could be the reason this creature was encountered at this location.Now concerning the encounter. The witness said he remembered falling off his bike, looking up and seeing this large, brown hairy creature. He estimated that it was ten feet from him, looking directly at him when it let out a loud howl/growl that terrified him. I asked him about facial and bodily features, other than what he stated in his report. He distinctly remembered the mouth being wide open as it howled/growled, displaying human-like teeth, only larger. The howl/growl was deep yet pitched, and lasted a few seconds. He said it sounded like nothing he has ever heard. Immediately after this it turned and walked off the trail into the woods at a high rate of speed. As it moved through the woods, the witness remembers hearing branches snapping. The witness then got up, climbed on his bike and rode home as fast as he could, where he hid in his house, fearfully peeking out the window hoping the creature did not follow him home.The witness seemed very credible to me. He was clear about the details he remembered and did not try to embellish or add to it. To this day the witness has not returned to the site of the encounter. This says something to me seeing he is a veteran of the Marine Corps, and a career Firefighter. Obviously what he witnessed made quite an impact on him.",

            "Observed": "Me and a really good friend were up On Green Mountain, Which is 10 miles or so up Mt.Loop Hwy. When you go up the mountain you can either Go right at the fork in the road , or go left up the hill. We went left. We were going to this really  nice look out point, we were planning on camping out there for the night. When we arrived at the spot we set up our fire, and we were just admiring the view, I kept hearing noises like branches or twigs, or something of that nature popping and breaking. I just thought some deer or rabbits, then they started getting alot closer and very quickly. I started to get a little uncomfortable, My friend Pat is deaf so he didnt have a clue what was going on. He just kept asking me what I was listning to, and why I kept looking up the road. So Id say about 2 minutes went by I had heard nothing, But I had this strange feeling that something was watching us, I paid no mind to it. Then out of nowhere a stick came flying over top of the truck and went tumbling down the hill. OK now Im starting to get nervous, My friend pat still has no clue what is happening but he sees that im getting a little distressed, and Right As I was telling him what was going on. A rock about the size basketball, a little smaller smashed  hard right in front of our fire, I began to get very  very uneasy. I didnt notice any smell or anything, the wind was blowing at us, So he must have been downwind, We packed out of there in about 10 seconds and I have yet to return to green mountain. There was no explination of the branches or rock crashing or rolling down. there was no sound just all of a sudden a rock landed about 8 feet from us. ????? I dont know Im just very uneasy about going there again, and everytime I talk about it to people and all my  hair starts to stand on end..",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness by phone .He is a local resident of the area. He said that he and a friend were sitting on the tailgate of their truck enjoying the view and their fire. They had not been there for long when he heard branch breaks followed a short time later by a large rock landing very close to them. He estimated the rock to be about ten pounds .The friend who is deaf felt the impact of the rock and was the first in the truck. They put out the fire and left. The witness gave me good directions to the area. I was able to find the location but since the incident happened one year ago there was no evidence of the rock. I found the witness to be credible and helpful. The report location is not far from report #23017 and report #23170.",
