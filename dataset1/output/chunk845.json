HE WAS ABOUT FIFTY FEET FROM ME SLIGHTLY UP THE HILL. ALL I SAW WAS THE BACK, SHOULDERS, HIPS AND TOP OF BUTTOCKS. IT WAS STILL AND HAD ITS BACK TO ME. THE HAIR COLOR WAS A LIGHTER SHADE OF RED AND SPARSE. I COULD SEE THE MUSCLES BENEATH THE HAIR. I TURNED THE CORNER AND DROVE DOWN THE ROAD, NOT WANTING TO DISTURB IT. I'VE GONE BACK TO THE SAME SPOT SINCE THEN LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING I COULD HAVER MISTAKEN FOR A BIGFOOT. THERE IS NOT!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on two occassions for a total of about one hour. She is an avid outdoors person and currently leads sea kayaking tours. She makes frequent one to three day camping trips to Baker Lake, in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. On this particular day she was exploring campground roads. On exiting the Shannon Creek Campground she observed a large, fur covered creature about 50 feet up the hill, across from her car. It was facing away, crouching, making a height estimate difficult. Its back and buttocks were exposed and she particularly noticed the musculature beneath its thin hair. It appeared to be busy, perhaps digging, and alternate muscle contractions were visible in its back. The anatomy of its gluteus muscles and \"butt crack\", were very human like, different than bear or another large mammal. Her overwhelming first reaction was not to disturb it. After observing for a few seconds, she drove away. On a subsequent trip to the same area, about two weeks later, she walked up to the spot to satisfy herself that nothing was different from her recollection. Beyond this brushy area is very thick forest leading steeply up towards Mt. Baker.",
