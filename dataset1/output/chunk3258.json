            "Follow-Up Report": "Eric has already shared his sighting for TV on the \"South Jersey Sasquatch\" episode of Finding Bigfoot. Unfortunately, the producers edited out his interview and recreation from the final show. BFRO Director Matt Moneymaker tweeted him that night saying \"That sucks - there's only 44 minutes in a show, and not everything we film makes it into the episode.\"The encounter happened just as he reported above. Other points of interest Eric and I can add is that there was a dead deer in the center of the road a short distance down from where the individual ran out from. The exact spot it came out of is a trail lined on both sides with chain link fence, and it leads into a development. It also runs parallel to high tension electrical lines, which are thought to be routes many animals will use for ease of travel.  As Eric mentioned above, it had a look of surprise when it was directly in front of his vehicle. Even hunched over, this individual was 2 1/2 to 3 feet above the hood of his car. The hair color was reddish blond, and roughly 3-4 inches in length, and was flowing with the speed it was moving. The hair did not appear to be matted down. No additional facial details, as this incident happened so fast. Eric did not see, as he said above - a muzzle, antlers, tail, ears, etc. The legs were thicker than his, and its arms were moving back and forth, as if to propel itself faster.There are a couple of reports from this area, of an animal that matches his description. The friend who was his passenger that night, saw the same thing as he did, and she too believes it was nothing other than a Sasquatch. The two of them have been out in the Pine Barrens together doing research for many years.",
