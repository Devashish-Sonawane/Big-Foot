            "Follow-Up Report": "I visited with the witness at length on November 19th and found her to be a very charming, down to earth and sensible woman whose family experienced some amazing interactions over a number of years with a white-furred bigfoot that they nicknamed \"Whisling Paddy\".The witness explained that while growing up her family lived in a very rural area of Lawrence County, near Ethridge, Tennessee.  Her grandparents had no running water, no electricity, no indoor plumbing, and the area was remote enough that there were a number of bootleggers living in the hills. The witness also explained that while she never saw the creature herself, she remembered hearing its whistle. She also heard various relatives and other local people speak about seeing it.  Additionally she had two uncles who were in the woods one evening in a tree house they had built when \"Paddy\" came up under their tree.  She related it was a very frightening experience for them though they were not harmed in any way. Her family routinely set out food for the animal  - usually potato scraps.Tracks were often found in their yard after a rain.  As she explained, there was not a lot of grass in the yards in that day and time due to chickens, goats, etc. running loose and it was quite common to see numerous immense human like  footprints in the bare dirt in their yard area.  Her grandfather had a particularly small foot and he always marveled at how easily his entire foot, with a shoe or boot on, fit completely inside the track.  The witness still lives in the same county in Tennessee and about a year ago she was out on her patio grilling after dark when she heard an unusually loud, long and mournful call.  The witness raises dogs and she stated that every one of her dogs started howling when they heard the sound.  Becoming frightened, she asked her husband to come out on the patio with her while she finished grilling.   He stayed for a while but when nothing further was heard he went back in.  It was not long after that the witness heard that familiar whistling sound that she had heard so often as a child.  She immediately knew what had been calling.  She recounted her experience to her two children and not long afterward her 10 year old son got up during the night to get a drink of water and heard the same moaning howl.  He was very frightened and immediately came running into his parents bedroom and climbed into bed with them.As a final note, the witness told me that she was prompted to file her report after reading about the Tom Biscardi hoax on the Internet.  She was very angered that someone would make a mockery out of an animal that she grew up knowing about and accepting the same way that we accept the presence of deer, squirrels and other local wildlife.
