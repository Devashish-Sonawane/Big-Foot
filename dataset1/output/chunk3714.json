Anyway I remember we came along a level area about midway maybe a little more and there was snow on the ground. We came across footprints very large but they stopped after a short distance. These footprints were not those of shoes, just feet. I remember getting scared and we returned home.  IF ONLY I HAD LOOKED UP, I WILL ALWAYS WONDER IF IT WAS ABOVE US IN THE TREES.",
