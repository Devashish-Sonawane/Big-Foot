            "Observed": "October 17th, a study at Radio Dome Parking lot, north of Hwy 20 Colville Washington. Time 9 pm to 1am. Gravel being thrown at my pickup in the front the gravel being thrown at the left of the Game Cam. Two loud thumping sounds on a tree and then followed by a low growling into a woofing sound ending in a high pitch screaming, 200 feet from our camp. Later the game cams caught the gravel being thrown in both directions, A huge black figure with mostly part head, shoulder ending in a  mostly clear picture of a shoulder, arm, and open hand that had thrown the gravel.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone. The witness is a retired wildlife biologist and was out scouting but at most places he ran into a lot of hunters. He and a friend went to the first location in the report. Nobody was around and they started a fire. He placed a trail camera on the right front hood and a second on top of a tool box in back of his truck with the tailgate down. At around 9:00 pm, the vocalization was a low growl that went into two whoops, then into a high pitched squeal. Then there were two wood on wood thumps. One half hour to forty five minutes later, he heard pea gravel hit the front of the truck. About ninety seconds later, pea gravel hit the side of the truck. They made sure the fire was out and left. No foul odor was detected. This location is where the radar base used to be, now called the parking lot; see attached history. The next day, Sunday they went to the top where the radar dome used to be. At noon on that Sunday, they were walking around the old buildings. He detected a sulfur-fecal odor two separate times but around the old buildings. He walked over to the edge and saw something black move below him but he said it could have been a moose, black bear or Bigfoot. He then heard a wood knock from the northeast and one from the southwest. The witness has had people say they see a figure in one of the trail camera pictures but he says it is not definitive and I agree. It is not snow in the one picture as a weather check showed zero precipitation. It could be bugs but the witness heard gravel hit his truck and found some gravel on top of his tool box. When going through the pictures, he saw one that showed what appeared to be an open hand. But he cannot find that picture and does think he deleted it by accident. The date is correct on the pictures but not the time. He did not set a correct time. Radar Dome has a long history of Bigfoot activity.   ",
