            "Observed": "Well last year I was night fishing 9/2010 at Amawalk Reservior SOMERS NY about 30 minutes from PAWLINGS I was fishing with my buddy..the reservior was about 100ft into the lake before you got to water .....about 5am sun was coming out..when a 5 foot maybe 5 1/2 ft man  or Big Foot came out of the woods washed its face and drank some of the reservoir water..he looked like something out of the old school \"Planets of the Apes\" chimps..I said to my buddy \"you see that?\"?he said yes ..Now on Animal Planet there showing a clip of a Big Foot that has been seen in these areas (Lower Hudson Valley)..So I'm puzzled to think what I saw was a Big Foot....so this my account of what I saw..and we didn't catch crap at night..anybody ever run into anything like this??...",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I was able to put three sightings together in the same area within a year\u0092s time with the help of this report.I spoke to the witness. He and his friend habitually anchor and fish from a mooring beginning 11 pm until about 7-8 am the next morning. This particular night was very cold and cloudy; they were fishing about 50 yards off shore and at sunrise he caught movement to his left. He claimed at first, he thought it was a naked man on the shore and couldn\u0092t understand why he\u0092d be out like that in the cold. He then realized it resembled something from \u0093The Planet of the Apes.\u0094 He told his friend to look. They watched as the creature about 6 ft tall (not very large,) went from bipedal, dropping down to hands and knees to drink from the water. It then stood back up and walked back into the woods. It never looked their way nor made a sound.A few months after his sighting, he posted what he had seen on a local website and a man answered claiming this the prior year:\"Hey Guys,I put at Amawalk this summer and about the 5th time I took it out in early October. I saw two upright walking chimp looking things walk out of the woods and crouch down and drink from the res, run back in to the woods and then do the same thing again. When they came out the second time one of them threw it's arms in the air while squatting and then they ran back into the woods. The second one went back slowly. It seemed like they saw something in the water right in front of them. That was right when the sun came up. I haven't been back to my boat since. I have no idea what they were and looked like two large chimps to me. Maybe some guy who lives there has two monkeys or something? I have no idea. But I saw something that I can't explain, it has been eating away at me since. When XXXXB posted here I didn't want to say that I saw something because I'm from Oregon and my hunting and logging part of the family thinks they know where they live but none of them have never ever seen them just have stories, just like everyone else in Oregon. Then I saw what I saw in October and have been denying it to myself ever since. I absolutely hope that someone owns two monkey's on the Amawalk.\"Recently I spoke to a law enforcement officer from that area. In late October 2010, she was driving to work at 3 am heading east on Route 35. There were no other cars and she was driving at about 30 mph. Just as she passed Tomahawk St. (South of Amawalk,) she saw something on the left side of the road, standing at the wood line. It seemed to be a tall human figure with its right arm casually leaning on a tree. It was looking down then turned its face toward her and appeared to look at her car.  It had red eye shine. It was in the light of her high beam headlights so she estimates it was about 30-40 feet away from her when she first saw it. She slowed down and realized it wasn\u0092t a bear or a human.  It appeared to be about 8 ft tall, without much of a neck. She claimed it reminded her of the novelist Dean Koons\u0092 \u0093Outsider\u0094 monster.The body was \u0093hulking,\u0094 with dark shaggy hair much longer than a bear - it was not smooth. She was able to just see the outline of it.The sighting was near the dam on Amawalk Reservoir.A clear pipeline road is nearby (similar to a powerline road) two wildlife sanctuaries that are nearby known for its chestnut trees and river trout. Muscoot River and Hollocks Mill Brook run near the sighting. There are also a few farms. She expressed shock about her sighting as she never thought such a thing existed.All three reports were in the early morning hours 3 am - 5 am in either September or October.",

            "Observed": "We went looking for Sasquatch in the woods surrounding our favorite campsite east of Fraser.  To our surprise we actually heard something.  On the first night we heard a very loud tree knock followed by something BIG walking down a slope away from us.  Two nights later we saw red glowing eyes that followed us.  On the third night we heard howling, tree knocking, and grunting.  While one member of our group was taking a pee he said he saw a figure about 5 feet tall start to walk away from him, then it stood up even taller, about eight feet tall.  Heard bi-pedal footsteps following us back to camp.  We left a glow stick on the road when we left.  When we returned to check on it, it had been placed in a hollow tree base.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The location near the Des Moines River where these events occurred is part of my main research area.  The area contains public access boat launches and campsites along the river surrounded by other public and private land.  Most of it is heavily wooded but there are also nearby row crop fields.  Roads are gravel.  The incidents happened over three separate nights in August 2013.  After the second night, I received notification from a mutual acquaintance who works in the area that the witness and his group had experienced something unusual and disturbing.  I encouraged my contact to have the witness submit a report to the BFRO.Normally I would be suspicious when I read a report from people who intentionally went looking for Sasquatch.  In this case, I know from the witness and others familiar with the situation that the exploration was made sincerely to follow-up on knocks, tree breaks, rock-throwing, howls and grunts seen and heard over many prior years that were never reported to the BFRO or any local authority.  I contacted the witness by phone shortly after he submitted his report to the BFRO.  We talked for over an hour.  I can add this detail to his report.Tues Aug 6.  Five people with flashlights went for a walk at about 11 pm a few hundred yards north of their campsite.  They found a clearing in the trees and sat in a circle for 10 minutes with flashlights off to allow their night vision to set in.  One in the group commented that he might have seen a walking figure move through the trees on ridge line above.  They left the area and returned back to the gravel road intending to return to their campsite. On the road heading south, another in the group performed four quick howls described as \u0093terrible.\u0094  There was an immediate wood knock response to their right in the direction of the river perhaps 100-200 yards away.  They walked 20 yards further, stopped and heard a loud wood knock up and to their left, but this time only about 20 yards away in the trees along the road.  Then from the same direction and even closer, the sound of a small tree or large branch crashing or being thrown to the ground.  They continued back to their campsite in haste and nothing further happened.  The next morning no broken trees or branches could be seen along the road leading to speculation that it may have been just violently shaken or stepped on as the unknown subject walked away, and not thrown.Thurs Aug 8.  The witness and five others returned to the same general area north of their campsite at about 11 pm.  After a few minutes, four left with the intention of returning to the campsite.  Witness and one other remained behind.  At this point witness observed what he described as two red glowing eyes about 30 yards away in the trees.  Unexpectedly, the four who had left moments before returned thinking they were being followed.  The witness actually observed the glowing eyes turn their attention from him to the returning group.  All six then returned to their campsite together. A sound described as a sapling whooshing to the ground was heard as they departed.Fri Aug 9.  The group planned to return to the same general area north of their campsite at around 11 pm.  Along the way, one of the guys stepped 20 feet away on the river side of the gravel road near the tree line to urinate.  At this point, the guy heard leaves rustling just ahead of him.  Then he saw what he described as a five foot shadow stand straight up to become eight feet tall, then turn and walk away.  He returned to the group noticeably pale and eager to leave.  A glow stick was activated and left in the middle of the road, then they returned south to their campsite along the gravel road all the time hearing rustling just inside the tree line to their right and left.  After about 10 minutes back at camp, witness and two others returned north back up the road and found the glow stick had been re-positioned at the base of a hollow dead tree.  Nothing else strange was observed.  No similar occurrences happened on any of the three nights once the group was back at the campsite.",
