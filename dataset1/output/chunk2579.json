Within 2 hours loud screams came from the ridge over the campground. On the second day we heard wood knocks and heavy steps, and twigs snapping before 4:00 am. We noticed our portable camp table had been bitten through. That day we dumped the guts in a turnout about a 1/2 mile from camp. On the third day we took one last look at the gut pile, it had a different smell of wet sweet dog, and all of the guts are gone.",
