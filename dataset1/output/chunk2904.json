            "Observed": "I was staying all night at my friend's house located off of KK Highway in Douglas County, Missouri.  This particular friend just lived a couple of miles from my home. She had told me about how she had heard loud, \"puppy-like\" howling noises, and how she always felt like she was being followed when she went on walks in the woods that surround her home.  She smoked, and said that when she was out on these walks she would at times hear something walking behind her, but when she lit her cigarette, the sounds seemed to stop.  Well, being fifteen and stupid at the time, I came up with this idea to go find what ever it was.  I thought that whatever it was had to be scared of fire, due to her whole cigarette analysis.  So, we took some hay from their barn and put it in paper bags.  We put the bags on the ends of thick branches that we found to make these so-called \"torches\".  I secured the bag to the branch on one of these torches with my belt.  So the adventure began.  We headed across their field toward the woods.  It was dusk at the time.  The field was about the one and a half lengths of a football field (I am not into sports, so I cannot really tell you actual feet).  When we reached the edge of the woods, which is where the family dumped some trash, we looked at each other and decided this was not such a bright idea.  We turned around and headed back to the house.  When we were around midway through the field something big and grey came darting toward us from the edge of the woods.  The distance between us and it was probably around 200 feet.  I took off running, without even telling my friend what I was running from; thankfully she followed.  I didn't even realize I still had those torches in my hands, which I finally dropped when we reached the area of the barn, which was about 100 feet from the house.  We ran into the house and stayed there for about 15 minutes, while I tried to fill her in about what I saw.  After we got enough courage up, we went outside again.  We could see about midway into the field a large, grey-colored, ape-like creature squatting down in the brush of the field.  It was just squatting there looking at us.  That was enough, and back into the house we went.  That night, we heard all kinds of commotion outside.  The next morning I had realized my belt was still out there by the barn.  when we went to get it, we found the torches ripped to shreds.  My belt had been torn into pieces, with teeth marks all over the leather clasp.  There were dents knocked into an old car the family had parked in the field.  Later, my friend told me that a little red wagon that was dumped in the dump site was bent in half.  Every time I stayed all night with this friend, whatever it was acted up with this type of behavior.  My friend actually had a calf that died with its neck broken and twisted all the way around after I had stayed the night.  I told my parents about this, and my dad actually wanted to go hunt whatever it was.  I haven't told a lot of people about this, because of fear that no one would believe me.  I go camping sometimes, and I am still very alert to my surroundings to this day, because I never want to see another one for the rest of my life.",

            "Observed": "On a real nice night in June about 9:30p.m. myself and some other guys were talking after a softball game on what we wanted to do. So one of the guys suggested that we go to the \"old resort\" to see if anybody was partying there. The old resort was a abandoned piece of land that had a strectch of driveway from a road that went over a hill down a low part and up again. And on top of that second hill was a old empty in-ground swimming pool and a couple of small collapsed buildings. I havenever been there before but heard of others talking about having a \"kegger\" there a time or two. So we all loaded up in Dave's van and off we went, there were 6 or 7 of us. When we arrived there we went over a gate down the hill and up the 2nd hill to the old resort. No one was there but I wanted to see this place for myself, the moon was real bright and your eyes adjusted real well to the lighting conditions and after about 20 min. of \"exploring \" we decided to head back to the van. Now there was 2 guys ahead of us, myself Mike and Gene, and 3 guys in back of us, at about a distance of 25 feet between each of the groups. The two others that were walking with me was Mike and Gene, I'm about 6' 3\" and Gene is about 6' 5\" and Mike was short. As we were walking west towards the van in between the two hills with woods on both sides of the path back to the road. I started to smell the worse odor that wasn't chemically produced. Something like real bad B.O., musky like and fecal. At that point I said \"Gene, what is that smell ? \" and Gene said \"It ain't a skunk but it's just as bad.\" Thats when Mike stopped in his tracks and began looking at our right .We stopped as well and Gene looked where Mike was and said \"Oh my god, look!\"   I looked and saw a figure about 20' from our location staring right back at us. Couldn't make out facial features because the moon was behind it but it stayed behind some brush just checking us out. I looked ahead of us and the guys in front were there and looked behind me and those guys was acounted for also. I said \"What is that?\" and Gene said \"I don't know but I can't handle this!\"  Off he went with me and Mike.  After him passing by the guys in front and when Gene got to the gate he climbed it with 2 steps and didn't stop until he got to the van. I know this because I was right behind him. We waited for the rest and told them what happened. Then I began to rationalize that maybe we just smelled a dead animal and maybe it was just a cedar tree swaying in the breeze. So Dave and I went back to the spot and there was no smell and no tree at the spot where I saw it. Whatever we saw was taller than both Gene and I by about a good half foot.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness via telephone in regards to the submitted sighting.  The following details can be added to the sighting report.  The witness stated that the smell was unbelievable and made them feel like they were going to be sick.  Once the witnesses stopped to investigate what was smelling so bad, the friend Gene noticed something standing behind a sapling off to the right on the path.  The path was approximately 4 feet higher than the edge of the woods and the animal observed was almost the same height as the witnesses.  The best estimation was approximately 8 to 9 feet tall.  The animal was observed for about 3 to 4 minutes, swaying side to side, with one hand holding on to the tree, the other hanging down by its side.  They estimated the tree to be about 12 inches in circumference and the hand was completely encompassing it.  I asked the witness what they thought the animal was doing, they stated that it appeared to be trying to hide.  The witness also noted that the animals head was a conical shape.  No other discernable features could be seen due to the moon being low and behind the sighted animal.About 15 minutes after the sighting, the witnesses went back to the sighting location, and saw no animal and noticed no smell.  They did not investigate further.  The witness also added that KYTV had produced a program about scary stories, that included bigfoot sightings in this same area at a later time.",
