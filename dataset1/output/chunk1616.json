I would take the Manistique river road to work every day to try and bag a couple of partridge on the way in.  This is a gravel road that runs along the river from Germfask to Manistique.  On this day, I left early and drove slowly for about the first half of the road.  I had shot one bird, and chased another into the popples a way, and realized that I was close to being late.",

Starting at the Seney National Wildlife Refuge, it twists and turns southwesterly some 50 miles, emptying into Lake Michigan at Manistique.The witness was 4-5 miles from Germfask. The animal appeared to be 6 1/2 - 7' tall and on the thin side. Its hair described as dark brown, not shiny, 4 1/2\" long and \"dreadlock looking\".  No additional details noticed, the sasquatch choosing to run in the same direction as his vehicle was very unnerving. Loading the gun made him feel safer.This avid outdoorsman and ex-US Marine now has a hard time enjoying the woods, always looking over his shoulder and experiencing what he calls \"irrational fear\".
