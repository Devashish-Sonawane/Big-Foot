His description of events are consistent and credible.At approximately 12:30 a.m. the witness and his girlfriend heard several wood knocks in a series, followed by two or three howls in the distance.  He described the howl as a whoop-howl, but is not certain if it was a coyote or something else.Many people hear knocks that sound like wood on wood.  Some people report the knocks sound like two stones being struck together.  The witness may have heard two or more bigfoots communicating their location to each other.  The howl is a bit more difficult to pin down of course, but given the circumstances and the way the events unfolded, there is a fair chance that they did hear bigfoot howls, perhaps in response to the wood knocks.",
