            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness at length by phone. Witness is now a school teacher in another state. He said the creature was very close, 10 to 15 feet when it suddenly began running away from the two men. It ran from their left to right and angled away from them running downhill.  They were only able to observe it only for a few seconds due to the dense brush.  The witness was very credible and remembered details of the sighting quite well. He described the arms as very long in comparison to it body. This witness was not able to give me an exact location due to having moved from the area several years ago. He is attempting to locate his hunting partner at the time so I can update this report.  The location of this sighting is an area of about 50 square miles of Ozarks terrain with only one gravel road traversing it. It is about 8 miles west of an arm of Table Rock Lake and the creek feeding this arm. Appears to be marshy in places and I feel warrants further investigation. ",
