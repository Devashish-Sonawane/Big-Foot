            "Observed": "I was going to Settle's Ford conservation area with my girlfriend to look at the stars. We pulled up to a gravel parking lot with fields to the east and a tree line to the west. My girlfriend and I felt uneasy for some reason when we got out of the car, but it had only been our second time there and we didn't bring her dog this time around. I have a pretty powerful little spotlight flashlight with a zoom lens to really get a distant read on eye shine. I decided to do a quick look around with it and almost out it down when I thought i saw something out of place in the field. I don't know why it caught my attention, as I had just skimmed over it with my flashlight before bringing it back around to decipher whether or not I was looking at an animal or a tree. But I noticed it was a little more... white? I shined the light on this thing for no more than 3 seconds before it started moving west. This was 50 yards away, but the first thought that came to my mind was it was a man, and told my girlfriend to immediately get in the car. Once I jumped in I realized that it is nearly 1 am, there are no cars here, and nobody would be in a field dressed in white at the hours. It just doesn't make sense.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the reporting witness less than a week after the event. Very fresh on his mind. This area is about 25 miles straight south from my location. He had been to this conservation area location before to fish and just hang out. They had been to this particular parking lot only once before, but due to the bridge being washed out they just didn't visit that often. The majority of the conservation area is on the south side of the Grand River, and they were on the north side. As they were standing in the parking lot, his girlfriend was putting on bug spray and he decided to pull out his powerful hunting light and do a sweep of the large field they were parked by, just to \"see what he could see\". As he had mentioned he had caught a very momentary glance of the creature as he fanned around the field (though it just didn't register as he was scanning quickly), so he scanned back and that is when he saw it. Description: White, head seemed to be \"distinct from the rest of the body\" and it appeared to be \"sitting on the shoulders with no neck\". It \"seemed to glide as it walked, and the arms stayed by its side\" as it walked away. The grass in the field was \"calf high, 1 to 1.5 feet tall at the most\". This was what he used to determine appx. height. Height was 7 ft. tall minimum. The field they were at was about 200 yards long and the creature was about 50 yards from them. He did not notice any facial features. It was not a man, a deer, a tree or anything else. At the moment he saw it his \"heart jumped out of his chest\".When he told his girlfriend there was something out there, she just screamed and headed for the car. They were getting out of there and he did a full circle to see if he could see it again with the headlights but it was gone. The fog was moving in and it was time to get gone.",
