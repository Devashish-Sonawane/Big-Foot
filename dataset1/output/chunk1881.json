About dusk, the witness was walking home with a friend after playing basketball. Fifteen to twenty feet off into the woods and standing behind a tree was an eight foot tall creature with both human and ape characteristics. Even though it was not yet dark, the animal's eyes were glowing red.  Watching for twenty or more seconds the witness noticed several things:         1.)  Most of the face was covered in dark fur, but               black skin surrounded the deep set eyes.         2.)  Ears were visible and were lighter in color.         3.)  The long arms hung down to the knees and               ended with large black hands about five times               the size of human hands.The witness got the feeling that this impressive creature could not be harmed.",
