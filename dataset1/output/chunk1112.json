It was approximately 3am when he crossed the Neches River, he had slowed down and turned on his bright lights due to deer activity near the river.   As he crossed the bridge, he saw a Creature 8' to 9' tall to his left carrying a deer over its left shoulder walking parallel to the bridge, the Creature looked over its right shoulder at the witness and he saw White/Yellowish eye shine. The eyes were large in diameter and set far apart, witness states that when it turned its head to look at him there was muscle mass from shoulder to shoulder that flexed and it was huge. The head was conical shaped with no neck, witness also described the color as reddish black. The Creature turned to the left and walked into the tree line in a casual walk and disappeared.The event lasted for approximately 5-10 seconds and the creature was 10 yards away walking the tree line next to the road.The witness says \"Those Glowing Eyes\", I just cant get it out of my head.

Normally the coyotes would be on a gut pile in an hour or so at this location, nothing touched the gut pile at all till it rotted. My fathers motion sensor lights at his house have come on many times, when we go to investigate, there is a great uneasy / being watch feeling that all of us have felt.",

            "Observed": "I was driving down the dead end country road I grew up on, checking the edges of our property for animals (deer, bear, etc..). As I pulled toward where the county road ends, and a private drive begins, I saw something \"out of place\", but at first I couldnt discern what it was. I stopped the car, and was looking forward, with my high beams on. As I watched a grey/brown very non descript patch to the right of the road in front of me seemed to move. I was concentrating to try to see what it was when it walked out into the road, and in 2 steps was gone on the other side into the brushy timber. The hair on my neck all stood on end and my neck burned. I sat for aproximatly 2 minutes trying to figure out what I had just seen.. mainly in disbelief.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness over the phone, and then later made an on-site investigation. This encounter happened as the witness was watching a game trail at the edge of the family property.  He was parked at the adjacent cemetery, observing the woods from about 100 yards away.  He wanted to see what deer might cross the private road.  As he sat in his vehicle watching, the witness saw a figure that was out of place on the right side. Then a bi-pedal creature, about seven feet tall, stepped across the road in two strides, from the right side of the road to the left.  He said that he felt like the creature hesitated because it was in the headlights of the witness\u0092s vehicle, then it decided to quickly cross the road.  The hair was shaggy, gray and brown.  He could not see the face, or tell the gender of the creature.  This witness has lived and hunted in this area all his life. He knows the wildlife that lives there.  This was something that he never thought he would ever see, but he recognized it immediately as a sasquatch.  This area is well known for frequent sightings of sasquatches.  See report 22475, which happened only a few miles to the east.  The river drainage provides ideal habitat, food sources, and the ability to travel without being observed except on rare occasions.  I believe this report is genuine and that this witness did actually see a sasquatch.This first picture is from the vantage point of the witness.  The creature was on the right side of the road about 30 feet past the gate.This picture is from the position of the creature. The witness was parked on the road near the big tree.This picture shows close up where the witness saw the creature standing.This picture shows the forest that the creature walked into from the position of the creature before it crossed the road.",
