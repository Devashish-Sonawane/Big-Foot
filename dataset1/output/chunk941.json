He believes there were at least three Bigfoot as the howls came from their right, the tree knocks from their left and the loud crash of a branch break was from the front of them. The sound of the break made the witness think it was a very large branch.The witness has gone into this area with his snowmobile for years and has seen coyotes, rabbits, grouse and fox. I asked him why he thought Bigfoot may have been in this remote area with that much snow. He said there is trout in the stream as another possible food source besides rabbits and grouse. The witness is also aware of caves in the area. After the first set of sounds, they started to have a snack and the witness did two whoops during the five minute pause. There was no response. When the howls began again, they decided to leave. They did not go into the forest to look for tracks. They were stopped at that location for about ten minutes. They did not detect any foul odor. Note: the location they stopped at is about one and one half miles from the Yakima Indian Reservation.  ",
