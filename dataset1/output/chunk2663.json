            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.It was the last of October when he heard the first vocalizations and then again a couple weeks later in November, 2012.The witness was a biologist in fish and wildlife habitat recovery for twenty years. He is a hunter and did some trapping when younger. He describes the first vocalizations in his report but adds sometimes it was like a woman screaming, then up to one minute later similar to laughter. It varied from high pitched to guttural, almost like talk. It came from a field and at first seemed close, then farther away. It went on for one half hour. He has three neighbors within one half mile and he later casually mentioned if they heard anything and they said no. But the vocalizations would continue for over two months and many heard them. A couple weeks later, he heard the same vocalizations from the same field but 500 to 700 yards from the first spot. This was sometime between midnight and 3am and also lasted for one half hour. No odor was detected. He has twenty five fruit trees around his house and his neighbors have five to ten apple trees. More can be read on this by searching the internet for Umatilla Screamer such as Bigfoot or Animals? Strange sounds coming from swamp on Umatilla Indian Reservation Also, the following compares scream recording with common Gray Fox, Barn Owl, Gray Wolf - Umatilla Reservation Screams \u0096 Is it Bigfoot or Something Else?And the following compares foxes, coyotes and wolves - A Comparative Acoustic Analysis of the \u0091Umatilla Calls\u0092But the witness has heard many animals in his professional background. He hears coyotes almost every night. He has a chicken coop and 100 yards away from it is a den that fox have raised young over many years. The witness never hears them. I wonder why would foxes vocalize for two to three months in 2012 to 2013 but then he has never heard them any other time? The witness occasionally sees a cougar and has heard it many times. He said he thought about cougar as a source of the sounds but the vocalizations were too guttural. In summary, he said, \"this had a set of lungs that a fox does not have. It was of substantial size, a lot of air behind it.\"  Considering his professional background and the fact he tried to rule out other animals, I find him very credible.  ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Talked with witness for some time about his encounter his brother-in-law and he had one night. After they heard the screams, his brother-in-law fell back asleep while the witness stayed up. This is when he heard the footsteps outside the tent. The tent was very large and tall. There was a window flap on the side that was open with the mesh screen. The brother-in-law was on the far side of the tent where he could be seen. The witness was on the opposite side where the mesh screen was, but could not be seen. This side is where the bipedal creature approached and cast the shadow. The witness was fully awake and terrified. He knew he could use his gun, but he was too scared. He also knew it could be a person, but he doubted it and didn't want to take a chance. There were no other hunters in the area. He tried waking his brother-in-law up, but he couldn't. He was also snoring. He didn't want to move around or make noise because he was afraid it might try to get in the tent. After it scratched the tent, it walked away and he heard it cross the gravel road. The witness stated that even though the shadow was only about five ft. high, he felt that whatever it was, it was a lot larger than that.  They packed up their gear that morning later and left. He plans never to return there again. This witness sounded like he was totally credible and honest in what he was telling me. He was just sharing what happened to them.",
