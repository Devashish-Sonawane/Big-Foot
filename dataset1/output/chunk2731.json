            "Observed": "During a camping trip along the north fork of the Coeur d'Alene river. We had recently finished dinner. While sitting fire side our dogs, a border collie and a pug leapt up and ran into the forest that separated the campsite from the creek. Neither made any sound but simply ran into the woods at twilight. Frustrated at the thought of chasing dogs in the woods at night I retrieved my flashlight from the cab of my truck. Upon approaching the tree line the dogs exploded out of the woods and ran to the truck where they cowered in fear staring into the woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.The witness and his girlfriend set up camp with a spare tent as more people were to come later in the camping trip. The only other camp was one quarter mile away. They had cooked steaks and oysters for dinner. When the dogs came running back from the trees, they were whimpering.The witness had his flashlight on the figure for at least two seconds and knew it was not a bear. It was leaning out from behind an approximately two foot diameter pine tree. He saw the right side of the upper body, the lower body was covered by bushes. He estimates the shoulder width at four feet based on the tree diameter. The right arm hung down into the bushes so no hand was seen. It was eight feet tall with smooth, shiny black hair about three inches long. The head was conical with no neck. The nose was broad, not a bear snout. Hair from the head hung down to the eyes. No ears or teeth were seen. No eye shine was seen. The skin on the face was black. No foul odor was detected. He used the words \"bulky\" and \"enormous\" to describe the figure.   When the rock was thrown, it hit the sticks in the fire and sparks landed on the side of his dining canopy. He stated he would never shoot at it, but shot into the air, and they continued to hear it move around and a tree break. The entire encounter was about forty five minutes. He and his girlfriend were very frightened, even though he felt it would not harm them. It affected him for a long time and he has just been sharing the encounter the past couple years. (He apologized for not turning in a report to the BFRO sooner - but we discussed a lot about bigfoot behavior and no apology needed.) He will not go camping again. I find the witness very credible.    For a Google Maps pin to the exact location where the sasqauatch was seen, click here.",
