            "Observed": "This happened almost 24 years ago, but it has never left me in all these years.  And I have never told anyone about these two incidents.  The first incident happened when I was bow deer hunting during the early season, as I remember that the leaves on the trees were still green.  I had returned to my car that was parked in a nearby field and got my hunting gear put away.  I then sat in my car waiting for about 10 minutes for my hunting friend to return so that we could go home. When he didn't return (he did return after the incident) I got out of my car and walked down close to the edge of the woods, maybe about 10 feet or so from the edge of the woods, shortly thereafter I heard something coming from my left just inside the woods edge.  It was making a lot of noise as it was walking through.  I thought this was my friend coming back, but then I thought that this  was \u0093very odd\u0094 for my friend since he was really quiet in the woods.  As the \u0093walker\u0094 was about right in front of me I called out my hunting friend's name to which I received a rather loud \u0093guttural growl\u0094.   But what ever the \u0093walker\u0094 was it did not break stride, it just kept right on walking rather loudly away from me going parallel with the edge of the field just inside the woods edge.  I have listened to over and over again the bipedal walking audio on the BFRO website - http://www.bfro.net/avevid/sierrasounds/911.asp#bipedal . It sounded just like this, but add in some very loud branch breaking and you will be very close to what I heard that night!!!!!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On August 10, 2013, I spoke with Joe regarding his report.  He has been a hunter for many years, and has experience with deer and bear.  Also, Joe had been trained by the Madison, Wisconsin police department to be an observer.  In late September 1989 he and a hunting partner went to a location where they were friends with the property owner, just south of Mount Horeb. Near the end of the day (early dusk) Joe after, securing his gear, waited in his car for his partner to return. After about ten minutes he walked towards the edge of the woods, and as he approached he heard heavy, bipedal walking coming from the woods on his left and moving towards him. Initially Joe thought it was his partner and Joe called his name, thinking \"...why would my partner walk like this? He must be hauling a deer.\" Joe called his name, and the bipedal walker made a loud, deep, growl just a few yards in front of him and at head level. The walker kept moving through the woods, moving parallel to the field. Shaken, Joe walked backwards to his car, keeping an eye out for whatever growled at him.  A short time later his partner returned.A few days later they returned to the location for more hunting. He took up his position in the woods, but after about an hour he heard something pacing back and forth about 25 yards in front of him. The pacing lasted for at least thirty minutes.  Rocks were then thrown at him, coming at him from the direction of the pacing. Joe then saw an arm and legs of what was pacing as it moved deeper into the woods. Then trees (Joe estimates the trees to be twenty feet tall) appeared to be violently shaken back and forth. At this point Joe turned and ran back to the car where his hunting partners were waiting. Since the incidents Joe has never returned to the location.I found Joe to be a credible witness who has nearly thirty years of significant hunting experience throughout Wisconsin and in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. He absolutely positive that what he heard was not deer, bear, or other animals, nor was it another hunter. Even 24 years later he is still shaken by the incidents.This occurred close to the location in report #40718.",

I have not discussed it with my wife, my best friend, or any other person close to me in my life. I was fortunate to have a coworker who had, many years ago, shared a similar personal experience that he had in Utah. He is the only person with whom I have shared my experience. I also want to say that what I am about to describe to you has tormented me for the last several months. I cannot emphasize enough how this encounter has affected me emotionally. Thanks to the encouragement of a fantastic confidant, I am now coming forward to report the incident as a step toward putting it behind me and getting on with my life. I did not ask for this, and had the event been within my control, I would have absolutely chosen not to have the experience. My life was perfectly fine with my previous view of reality, as incomplete and skewed as it may have been.",
