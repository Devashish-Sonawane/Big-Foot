            "Observed": "There were six of driving toward shelby forest one night just after dark.  We had probably driven 5 or 6 miles from Highway 51 when I was something run accross the road in front of the car just inside for the headlight range.  At the same time I saw this the driver of the car stopped immediately and looked around at everyone in the car.  Apparently he could tell by my look I saw it too and then asked me directly if I saw \"it\".  I said yes and then we drove in reverse until there was a turnaround between the divided highway and got out of there.  To this day I am not sure what it was that I saw but it was on two feet and very fast.  Watkins extended is divided  and it crossed 4 traffic lanes and the median in just a couple of seconds.  It was very big black and looked like it was covered with fur.  It was hard to tell exactly since it was just inside the headlight range and happened very quicky.  It ran with a slight forward tilt and with very little arm bend.  No one else in the car saw it besides myself and the driver.",

            "Follow-Up Report": " I spoke to the witness by phone. He noted that the area of the sighting was much less populated and developed at the time than it is at present. The sighting was brief, only 3 or 4 seconds, but he noted that the body build was large. He estimated the height at over six feet. The body appeared to be hair covered, brownish or black in color and \"pretty consistent in color from head to toe\". The arms moved with the running motion \"about like a human\". No real impressions of head shape or arm length were noted.",

After about two minutes we realized it was a squatch. It stood up and towered over the grass which was about five feet tall at the time. We stood there watching it for about five minutes until it retreated to the woods. The hairy creature was clearly walking on two feet. I have no doubt in my mind we saw a squatch. After talking to my dad who has lived on our property for years, he too had seen a squatch years ago as a boy.",

            "Observed": "It was early evening and our golden retriever was barking loudly. This was not unusual as there are many deer behind our house. Our back yard consists of a large twenty acre field leading into a wooded area. When I went outside to call the dog in and I saw six or seven deer running like heck like they were being chased, I looked behind them and in the tall grass a large hairy animal was chasing after them running on two legs towering above the grass which was around four feet tall at the time.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness via phone a few times, over a period of a few months. This family lives and farms in Connecticut. Located in a mix of hardwoods and farm land, with streams, marsh and just your garden variety of the typical New England landscape. The witness mentioned all the potential game, saying there's plenty of deer, etc. behind their house and a variety of farm animals that were readily available. Basically a bounty in the backyard, and a river runs near it too.On this night the witness went outside to call the dog into the house, and that's when the witness had seen six or seven deer running, like they were being chased. He looked behind them and in the tall grass, about a 100 yards from the house, a large hairy animal was chasing after the deer, running on two legs. The color described as a \"dark coffee color\", it was very tall, towering above the grass which was around four feet tall at the time. The witness is a local, and knows the difference between all the typical wildlife from the region, and this didn't belong. The witness is convinced it was a Bigfoot, in the past they've also heard screeching, screams and howls on the farm property. The witness was also talking about how the local town farmers had made reports, and had encounters in the past. I will be investigating further with those other local farmers that may, or may not, of had an encounter with a Bigfoot in Connecticut.This is what I would consider a prime area for a Bigfoot to pass through without much notice. There are some large tracts of unused, or seldom visited, areas in that part of Connecticut, so opportunities for the Bigfoot looking for its essential needs could be met with success here in New England.",
