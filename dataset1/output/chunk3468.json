            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and I talked thru e-mails and our phone conversations. She was driving through the beautiful hillside of Litchfield. She looked across one of the fields and saw a big black object walking up the hill (steep slope) it was walking slowly up the hill in the snow. It then crossed a driveway in about 3 steps and was back in the woods, it was slouching along swinging its arms, headed towards the power lines approx. 800 yards away.  It didn't have a hat or any other clothes on..to Karen it looked like the creatures head just sat on its shoulders. She thought possibly it may be a person, but with the slope of the hill it couldn't be a person. the slope was to steep and  much snow . This tall black figure just walked across the slope with out a care in the world.It was easy to see with the snow and sunlight as a back ground . She watched this unfold for a few minutes.",
