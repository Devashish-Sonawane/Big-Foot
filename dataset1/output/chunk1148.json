            "Observed": "I had two experience's with what I believe to be the Grassman in 2007. The first encounter happened on a strip pond. We took a boat back to a spot along the high wall to where there was a flat spot to camp. We set up camp, fished, cooked, and then went to bed around 11 PM. At approximately 4 AM, I was awaken to heavy footsteps walking down over the near vertical high wall. It approached the tent and I heard heavy raspy breathing. After a few seconds, I cleared my throat. Then to my amazement, it cleared its throat mimicking me. At that point I started screaming I had a gun. My friend would not wake up for some reason. I finally calmed down some and could hear it walk down to the water. Once there, I could hear it sipping water out of its hands. After that, it walked back to the tent, sat for a minute then walked back up the hill. The next morning we found 18 inch tracks right on the edge of the reeds.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After contacting the witness by e-mail and phone, I found the witness to be very credible, so I arranged a meeting to visit the location where he had his encounter.I met with the witness on a property adjoining the original site. We were unable to go to the exact spot due to the property now having new owners and it was also reclaimed in the last five years.The witness' recollection of events lead me to believe that he and his friend did encounter a Bigfoot on two occasions that weekend. The thick brush, sheer walls of the strip pit, and the remoteness of the site would prevent pranksters from harassing them. Also, the time frame of the event preceded televised accounts and TV shows that would have informed him of other witness' experiences.At the time of the encounter much of the area was inaccessible due to extensive surface mining in the early to mid 1900's. It also contained many sheer wall strip pit ponds surrounded by multi-flora rose thickets. Access was through the landowners home site and you either hiked or rode an ATV to the various ponds.The site is in a deep valley southwest of State Route 250, the highway follows a ridge for 12 miles until it reaches the Ohio River. Many of the surrounding properties are still owned by numerous mining companies which limit public access.We also investigated an abandoned rail bed that was about 1/8th of a mile from the property. This rail bed has been reclaimed by nature and has a 200 yard tunnel that runs under State Route 250 that provides wildlife with a hidden highway running for miles.",

            "Observed": "I was camping by myself on a friend's private property near the Meramec River in Steelville, MO (Crawford County). I was getting ready to go to bed in my tent when I heard leaves and twigs on the ground crackling in the woods a few yards away, I thought it might be deer.  I got in my tent, which was a tall tent, about 10 feet tall and left my lantern on outside. I was starting to fall asleep, when I heard something big coming out of the woods, I was Paralyzed, I saw the giant shadow on my tent from the lantern, it was about 8 and a half feet tall with broad shoulders, I thought to myself this is not a black bear, I was about 5 feet away from where my food containers were and my cooler.  It opened my food containers and started eating my bread, I heard low growling, there were teeth marks found the next day, it went through my cooler, dumped it over and stole my meat, like pork and beef steaks and then ran into the woods. I heard some vocalizations down near the river.  I could not sleep the rest of the night. The next day I went down to the river on one of the river sand islands and found some big foot prints, I wish that I had a camera with me, but I did not, I kept it to myself all these years for fear of ridicule.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "In summary:I spoke to the witness via telephone and the following can be added to the narrative:Growling was heard when the meat was discovered.It was a clear night with a quarter moon and pleasant camping temperatures.Whooping and tree knocks were heard down at the riverbank (50 yards from the campsite) after the visitation ended. These lasted around an hour.16 inch footprints (estimated) were discovered the following morning.  The witness wears a size 8.  ",
