            "Follow-Up Report": "Tom's overnight campout in the Berkshires turned out to be a very interesting recorded encounter in the middle of the night. There are 3 potential wood knocks at the 5:54 mark on the video posted on his blog. Heard off in the not to far distance, late at night, in a winters mountainous deciduous forest and were recorded on his MP3 recorder. Upon listening to the recording Tom noticed something that needed further scrutiny to be sure of what he had recorded. He then sent this to me for analyzing and there is a clear distant-loud noise that could be a wood knock:(Short clip of strange sound)With Tom\u0092s permission I sent the recording of the potential wood knocks to the essential people at the BFRO. This is what the recording analyst had to say: \"Yes, I'd say that's a wood knock. In my head phones it definitely has a wood on wood note. But even better, I can hear some vocals. The wood knock itself has a trailing sound that ascends. I believe that is a whoop that start exactly at the same time as the wood knock. And then after the knock/whoop, very faintly, there's a descending shriek in the distance. There may be another deep vocal in there too, but it's right on the edge of hearing. I've attached an amped and filtered version that might sound better to you\".(Amped and filtered version)Numerous reports have come out of this area, I personally have seen a mountain lion in the area.
