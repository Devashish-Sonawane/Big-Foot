We were doing one in late September to October. The early evening with the sun shining through the trees, and when my daughter turned the corner on our gator, as she looked ahead, there was a tall black figure picking leaves off of the tree. The sun was on the opposite side of the figure where you could see the tips/chunks of hair all over it. As we were leaving, we heard four huge howls that could not have been a coyote. We left immediately after this. A few weeks after this encounter in the morning we were just about to head back to the house and were finishing up with some wood-knocks, and rock-clacks. We did one last call, when all of a sudden a rock was thrown at our Polaris. We also got a picture of the animal. It was a very frightening experience and we immediately left and didn't return for a few weeks! Thank you so much for your time!! We would love for you to come to the squatchy Missouri.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with the mother, the children ages 13 and 10 were present and answered my questions with their mother present. Mother was there but did not actually see the bigfoot. Daughter and brother were out riding around on an ATV and had pulled up at a clearing. Daughter saw a creature 7 - 7 1/2 feet tall, reaching up over its head, pulling branches down with its hands and removing the leaves with its mouth, eating them. Coloring was black, or very dark. It was late afternoon and the sun was bright, but lowering in the sky. The creature was backlit, and was seen clearly. Hair was 2-3 inches in length, shiny and not matted. Distance from her to the creature was 30-40 yards. Weight not estimated by witness but the build was quite stocky. Frame of reference for height and build was her dad, who is 6 ft and of a slight, stocky build. Creature was considerably taller and much heavier. When she saw the creature she took a photo with her cell phone, she turned the ATV around and left with her brother behind her on the ATV, with his arms around her waist. She did not tell him what she saw at the time. She just wanted to leave at that point and remove she and her brother from the area. This is the low-quality photo she took with her cell phone:Due to the low quality its hard to tell what she may have captured in this photo. They discussed it later on and her brother only caught a glimpse of it for a couple seconds as they drove away. He asked what he had seen.  Mom stated her daughter was bright and articulate, and aware of the various forms of wildlife on the farm. She was very clear as to what she saw, and mom could tell from her daughters agitated state that an \"event\" had occurred.About 5 minutes later is when they heard the four howls, not high pitched but more like what is on the show. The howls came from the \"opposite side of the field\" from where the sighting occurred, though she cannot be positive. She just felt as though they were from the same \"general\" area, but not the exact site of the sighting. As for the rock throwing a few weeks later, it was the same area as the sighting. Rock was large, half the size of a bowling ball, if she were to guess.I live in the area, and there would be ample food source for creatures of this type. Mostly hickory, oak, honey locust and evergreen trees are around the farm. They can't say exactly what tree it was pulling leaves from. This is a 100 acre farm with no hunting allowed except occasionally by the husband. They do not currently live on the farm. They live in another town north of here and go to the farm on weekends as time allows, to play and work on the home. The fact that the farm is \"vacant\" most of the time and no hunting allowed would be a good haven for Sasquatch. In the last few months there have been several reports coming in from within 10-15 miles as the crow flies from this location. There are large creeks, rivers, heavy to light woods, hills and a few caves in the area. ",
