            "Observed": "On November 6, 2012 I was walking our 106 acres located in central Alpena County. It had just snowed (1-2\") the day before. While on one of our many paths I came across large tracks that were not like anything I've seen before. Later upon notifying my south neighbor, he also found the same type of tracks. They were 5.5\" X 10\"; flat without any toe or craw marks. The gait from toe to heal was 20\" and walked in a straight line. This animal walked through dense forest and underbrush which a human would (normally) not enter.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "BFRO Volunteer Richard Knox followed up with the witness.The area where the tracks were found is on the witness\u0092 property, which is located around half an hour west of Alpena and Thunder Bay, off Lake Huron. There is a river to the west of the property, food plots to the northeast and a stock pond to the south. A power- line corridor runs east to west with a portion branching off to service his residence and neighbors. It was in the middle of 2012 hunting season, the witness was out walking his property after a 1 \u0096 2\u0094 snow fall the night before, when he discovered these tracks. \u0093The stride length, the lack of a heel impression, the straightness of the tracks and the density of the brush that the tracks went through,\" the witness stated, was the most convincing details that convinced him that these tracks were not created by a person walking on the pathways. The tracks did not match any known animal prints that the witness has seen.  His photo showing the straight path of the trackway:Stride length in a person or animal is the distance between successive steps of the same foot/paw. So as you or an animal is walking, each time there is a step, the distance between the same points on the same foot is considered your stride length. (ex: left heel to left heel, right toes to right toes.). Whereas, the distance between the same points on opposite feet/paws is the step length. (ex: Left heel to right heel, right toes to left toes. Right heel front paw to left heel front paw.)The witness has seen bear tracks which can sometimes overlap depending on the speed of their gait and general body size. But most often the back paw lands in front of the previous fore paw.  A double bear print can resemble a human-sized or larger print. Melting can add to that effect but bear feet tend to point outwards when walking, and this is not the case in these photographs.Later that day, the witness spoke with a couple of his neighbors and they too had seen similar tracks.  The witness is an avid outdoorsman, trout fisherman and hunter with friends and numerous contacts in the conservation field. The witness and his wife have a sizable collection of wildlife material, along with a family member who has written numerous wildlife articles for magazines.  I find the information provided to me to be from a credible and educated individual, having lifelong experiences with both wildlife and the environment he lives in. Further, I was impressed that he took the time to photograph and measure the prints. ",

Around 11:30pm we were bored and so my girlfriend and my two sisters and I decided to sneak out of the house and take a walk around the lake. There were other houses around this lake also.  The skies were clear and the weather was nice.  We got about half way around the lake when I heard something behind me and turned around to see. I was startled to see a big tall hairy thing about 13 feet tall. I saw it walk across the road about 5 feet behind us. I screamed, and my sister who was 13 years old at the time turned and saw it also. My baby sister was too little and can't remember. I don't remember if my girl friend saw it. We took off running and screaming back to our house. We went into my bedroom and were awake the rest of the night afraid to make a move thinking it was still out there. I was 15 years old at the time.",
