            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness and her daughter on the phone, and then went to their home for an interview. Their stories were consistent, and I found them both to be credible.Adding to what they said in their initial report is the following:The mother said that the incident happened close to Halloween...probably October 23rd or 24th, 2015. When asked if it could possibly have been a human in a costume, both witnesses adamantly said that because of the size and appearance, that it was not a human.It was right at the spot where Route 62 dead ends and turns right to head into Salem, OH. She was driving from Salem, approaching that intersection, when she slowed down because she noticed movement to her left. She said deer frequently run across the road in that location, and that she assumed one was about to cross the road. Approximately 20 feet ahead, what she called a \"creature\" walked out from the treeline and took three (total) steps to get across the road. It was looking straight ahead, and was very skinny.Both mother and daughter described the creature as having shaggy hair rather than fur, and both said the hair was wet from the misty rain. The mother said that the long arms swung as it walked, and that its \"face didn't stick out like a bear's\".When asked if the creature had passed by anything that could give me some kind of scale as to its height, both witnesses said that it had walked \"right behind\" a street sign, and that it seemed to be approximately 6 inches (when I measured their hand spread) taller than that.The witnesses took me to the location to show me exactly where this had occurred. When we arrived, no street sign was evident. I walked to the location where they said the creature had crossed, and a noticeable hole was left that indicated a sign had possibly been there at one time. I later called Salem's City Hall to ask about a sign, and they directed me to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. I was finally able to talk to someone who told me that there indeed used to be a sign there, and that their standard practice was to anchor the signs so that the top of the sign was at 7 feet. Depending on the angle that the witnesses saw the creature, this puts it at a possible 7 feet, 6 inches tall. The mother described the creature as having no visible neck, and that its head was egg-shaped. They both said that after crossing the road, the creature walked through some grass away from the street sign, up a driveway, and behind a house.All of this was seen while their car's windshield wipers were going at a slow speed. This part of Columbiana County has several patches of timber interspersed with large farm fields and housing developments. Deer, corn, fruit trees, and water are substantial.",
