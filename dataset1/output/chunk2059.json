It is a popular swimming and fishing spot. It supposedly happened in the early 1960's. An old man was fishing around dusk and heard splashng in the creek towards the bridge.  He started walking towards the sound then saw something splashing crouched down in the middle of the creek.  He got closer, and then he tripped and almost fell. He  startled what ever was in the creek and it was gone by the time he regained his balance and looked back towards the bridge.  He left right after that.  This was one of the stories I heard while I still lived there.",

            "Observed": "It was July, 1978.  My family had just moved from Illinois to Cape Fair, Missouri a few weeks before. Our parents went back to Illinois for a funeral and my sisters (ages 16 & 14) and I (12 years old at the time) were there alone.  It was late at night around 11 or midnight when we all were startled by our dogs barking and growling on the porch.  Normally the dogs would go down to the driveway if they heard something.  This time they stayed on the porch looking towards the front yard barking and growling like I have never heard them do before.  What scared us was that the dogs were scared to go down off the porch. We turned all the lights off in the house and looked out the front windows and door to see if we could see headlights or something outside.  There was a flood light at the corner of the driveway that cast a light on the front yard.  The front yard was all uphill with a 5 ft barbed wire fence separating our yard from the pasture.  The front yard had huge black walnut trees spaced about 30-50 feet apart scattered around.  I was looking out the front window and saw a large figure standing partially behind a walnut tree.  I stared at it a few moments to focus in the dim light to see what it was.  I thought it was maybe a drunk camper who was lost.  You could walk down our back yard to the lake, so I thought maybe someone was looking for a way to the lake through our yard.  People would camp and fish very close by, so we thought somebody was lost.  All around our house it was dense forest and there was only one other house on our 1/2 mile road, so we were very isolated. My 16 yers old sister went to calm the dogs down.  The 14 year old and I were stioll looking out front.  Then after a few moments the figure dashed to the next tree about 50 feet away in about 3 or 4 strides.  I kept looking and before I could ask my 14 yr old sister if she saw that- she ran to the back porch to help my 16 yr old sister with the dogs.  By this time the dogs were freaking out.  Then I looked back to the front yard where I saw it go to another tree, then another tree-zigzagging its way up the hill towards the pasture.  Then to my amazement it cleared the barbed wire fence in one stride and was gone into the night.  My sisters were tending to the dogs so they didn't see all of what I saw.  My 14 year old sister said she saw something by the tree-but she never said anything more than that.  I don't know if they were trying to keep me from getting scared, but I think she saw it too.  I told my parents about it when they got home.  They just blew it off to a city kid seeing \"something\" in the country night.  While I lived there until 1984, I had heard stories of the \"Ozark Mountain Monster\" but thought it was just folklore. I did have several conversations with oldtimers from the area and heard stories of bigfoot sightings over the years, but never had the courage to \"go public\".  I am 37 now and do still believe to this day I saw a bigfoot.  I still get chills when I think about it and am having chills while I am typing this right now.  Too spooky!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.  She was very impressed by the immense size of the animal, being at least seven feet tall and very bulky.  The walnut trees being huge gave her a reference point to the size.  The animal was not slowed down by the five foot fence.  After twenty-six years she still spoke about the fear she and her young sisters felt  during the brief sighting.",

            "Observed": "I was helping my mother-inlaw with the begining stages of preparing her 8 acre property so that she could build a house on it. The area is mostly covered in Oak trees, Cabbage Palms, Scrub Oaks, Mullberry trees, and Brazian Pepper trees With wild Grape vines hanging out of the trees to the ground.The majority of the acreage is flat ground covered with Oaks there is a state drainage ditch that runs close to the East side of plot, that is where I was working near the road. on the other side of the ditch there is an extremely low swampy area near the North side of the land along the road in the wet season (May to October)I have seen small fish, turtles, and gators in this area. My wife's cousin lives in a in a house in the ajacent property with Oaks covering a good bit of it but cleared under the trees. On a previous Previous trip out to my mother-inlaws land I in stalled a tempory gate in the barbed wire fence. This time out I hired a friend's 15 year old son  to help haul branches that I was cutting back to a clearing In the middle of the property to be burned at a later date. I cleared and he hauled for a few hours, after a while I noticed that he was getting tired and it was starting to get later in the day. around 5:00-5:30 PM so decided to stop clearing and help him carry the branches back. For a good bit of the time the cousins dog follow him back and forth as he hauled the branches. Anyway as we were walk back we came to a spot where the fence was pulled back between the two parcels and the dog came through the gap in the fence, at the moment coming out of what would be the back of the low swampy area was three whoops. The first one was long and drawn out the two that followed were short. A chill ran down my spine as my mind was trying to place a animal to the sound. It was too loud and too deep to have come from an owl. What ever it came from it came from a large chest. At this point I did think Bigfoot and looked down at the dog but she was calm and seemed happy. I then looked back at the area that the whoops came from and there was a squirrel sitting on a downed palm flicking its tail. This made me dismiss the Bigfoot idea. I immediately asked the boy if he had heard that. The thing is theres no way anyone could have missed it, it was so loud. then he said he heard it on one of his previous trips back. For days I racked my brain for what could have been I have been hiking in the woods and swamps of Florida all my life and know the sounds of the local wild life and couldn't come up with anything that fits the bill. It did sound alot like the Howler Monkeys I've heard in zoos, but the tone was way too deep to be a Howler Monkey. About a week later I was out with a cotractor to talk about putting in a drive back to where the house is to bee built. He also has been in Florida a long time, so told him of the noise I heard and asked him if he could tink of any animal that could have made that sound and he said a Whooping Crain. I said oh! yah that must be it. I went home satisfied with that answer. About week later I was poking around the internet and I looked up info on Whooping Crains and there was recordings on the site I found. When I played the track a chill ran through me not because it was the sound I heard but because it wasn't. I thought about sending a report in for months now, but because of being so unsure of what I heard I held back. Well today I was at my daughters babyshower and the cousin was there for some reason my 12 year old decided that it was a good time to blurt out I saw a Bigfoot, correcting him I said I heard a noise, and of course he said that I heard a Bigfoot I again corrected him and said that I didn't know what it was and elaberated that it was out on the property. At this point the cousin became very interested and asked what it sounded like, so I imitated whoops for her at that she said that she had been hearing strange sounds out there too. I asked if they were whooping and she said yes but there was other sounds to it also she said screaming and whooping I ask if it sounded like a woman screaming and she said kind of but not exactly. She ended it with there is some thing out there.",
