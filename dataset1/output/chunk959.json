            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.The witness and his father-in-law were in a remote spot near Strawberry Lake. It was the first night of the elk hunting trip but they did not bag anything that day. They saw another elk camp about ten miles away but that was the only other camp they were aware of. After splitting firewood, they heard two very loud knocks. The witness then hit a tree about twelve inches in diameter with a piece of firewood but it was not very loud. One minute later, one very loud knock was returned.Exact time unsure, but around 1 am they were awakened by a slap on their tent. It sounded as if a broom or large bough hit the tent. They got out of the tent and did not find any broken boughs. They were back asleep when a roar next to the tent awakened them. The witness described it sounding like a train. Again, they got out of the tent to look around. They did not find any tracks nor smell any foul odor. They saw three elk the next morning. Mt. St. Helens erupted on May 18, 1980. There is a long history of Bigfoot activity in this area. The \"attack\" the witness refers to is the 1924 violent encounter between miners and a group of apemen.
