Me, my dad and brother in law was fishing in a boat by Holiday Island, AR in a cove called the Leatherwood Creek. We were trolling along the bank and at about 9 am along an area that opened up from the trees to a rocky area that was a power line clearing when we seen a Bigfoot like creature walking upright over fairly big rocks towards the power line.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted witness via phone and emails. He was eager to finally speak about the event he had been sitting on for years. I usually ask, when the incident happened years before, why the long wait to come forward. And the answer is usually fear of ridicule or mockery. They had gone trolling along the bank of a lake about 9AM. The current was moving them along at the perfect speed for trolling. The creature was first seen emerging from the woods near \"a power line clearing\". This clearing was for telephone poles and not the large clear cuts for the big power towers. The clearing was 30 feet or so versus 150 feet or more for the big clear cuts.The three of them sat in stunned silence as they floated the current. The creature was \"black or dark brown and walking over fairly big rocks that were about 2 feet around\". It had a \"slightly slumped over posture with very long arms and a very long stride\". It had \" a demonic look\". The distance was about 50 yards or less, and that distance was maintained during the sighting. The creature walked along the rocky bank across the power line clearing and disappeared into the woods on the other side of the clearing.Before the sighting they had no preconceived notions of Sasquatch. They had heard of it but there had been no overt interest.",
