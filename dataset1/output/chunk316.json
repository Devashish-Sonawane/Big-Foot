            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and his nephew were hunting in the Big Cypress National Park. They entered the hunting area into Monroe Station walking the trail where there's an open field. They proceeded past the trail to the right. Then cut through the open field. Even though a very nice day they saw no game. Between 6 pm and 6:15 p.m., it was still good light out. Just before they entered the woods, the nephew decides to go across to the other woods to see the other side of the field while waiting for the witness. He was out in the open from the tree line about 60 yards and he noticed a movement from the distance when he saw a large creature on two legs walking big steps right where they had been, it appeared to be following them in the distance. The witness started shouting for his nephew. It stood behind a tree moving its head gently side to side looking at the witness. It was dark, with a square head. The arms hung below the knees. They ran into the woods to cross over to the trail and by the time they got to the trail it was night fall. Luckily there was a man in a buggy with his wife. They gave the pair a ride out.

He says in over twenty years in the woods he has never heard anything like what he heard up there.He said the scream seemed to start just prior to 11:30 P. M. from an open meadow approximately twenty yards from his campsite.  The scream was high-pitched and loud enough to wake him from a sound sleep. It reminded him of a sound he's heard gibbons make. It frightened him enough that he nearly left his campsite and went home that night. The duration of the scream was estimated to be approximately five to ten seconds. After the scream two owls nearby started hooting a lot as if they had been disturbed by the noise.  He also mentioned that the scream was predominately a high-pitched scream, but he also noticed a low toned \"vibe\" that seemed to be part of the scream. The area in which this scream was heard has had a long history of bigfoot related reports.  ",
