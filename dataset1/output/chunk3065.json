However, he was very verbal during a lengthy phone conversation and described his encounter in much detail.  He also said he would try to get the other witness to speak to me as well.       The encounter:  He and the friend were just getting into the woods for an early morning of deer hunting.  He said they must have chanced upon the BF, because suddenly, just ahead of them (150' est.), the critter stood up.  He and his friend froze, while the BF paced back and forth.  It then grabbed a large bush and began to shake it and then it \"screamed at us.\"  That is when he and his friend ran away \"in a panic.\"        5-6 hours later (full sunlight), they ventured back to the spot.  Judging from the height of the bush the critter shook, it stood about 8' tall.  No prints or hair were found.    Witness says that his wife urged him to file this report after they watched something on TV about the BFRO. ",
