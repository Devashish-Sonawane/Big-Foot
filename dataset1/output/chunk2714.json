            "Follow-Up Report": "This investigator determined the witness to be very credible in the account of his report. After talking to the witness on January 21, 2007, he mentioned that after hunting all of his adult life he immediately recognized that these bipedal tracks were not made by man or any known wildlife. Forty tracks were viewed traversing 70 yards of terrain and one half mile from a residential area. The tracks were at least 17 inches long, and the long strides (49.5\u0092\u0092) were what caught their attention initially. The tracks were 4.75 inches wide in the heel, and 8.5 inches in the ball of the foot. The track depth went all the way down to the ground which was 18 inches, the depth of the snow. The heel was clearly defined but the toe area wasn\u0092t as clear; he couldn\u0092t tell how many toes there were. Because of his limited mobility, he only followed the tracks for the 70 yards but was able to follow the tracks as it went up a 7 degree incline and viewed no slippage or hesitation in the track route. The track prints showed weight shifts in weight distribution as it covered various terrain.   The tracks took a southeast to northwest orientation in an area no one had visited since it had snowed 5 hours before. One of the things that stood out in the witness\u0092s mind was the straight and direct route that the tracks took. The witness was asked, \u0093What were the chances that the tracks were faked?\u0094 He said that it was unlikely because of the stride length. \u0093Someone couldn\u0092t fake the stride length without having left some kind of foot drag mark in the snow or faultier in their steps\u0094. The witness has 35 years of hunting experience and wasn\u0092t able to tell what kind of animal would have made the tracks.  The husband and wife were out driving around a week before the track sighting on a dirt road 100 yards from a residential area scouting out deer tracks. They had been on the road three days before and saw nothing. They came across two deer remains (doe, and maybe a yearling) on the side of the dirt road, within 3 feet of each other. \u0093They were picked clean.\" What was unusual to them was that the rib cages were still attached to the spines. To the woman, who was an autopsy nurse, she said who told her, \u0093The connective tissues were still functioning, meaning the deers were killed recently, within a couple of days.\u0094 She elaborated that if it was a poacher, they wouldn\u0092t leave the remains on the side of a dirt road in plain sight, because the DNR in their area are very aggressive. If it was a bear it would have dragged it off into the woods. The husband added that bears are hibernating now.    To the husband, the carcass remains were unusual. \u0093He said \u0093The legs looked as if they were broken or twisted.\u0094 He\u0092s heard of wolves in the Upper Peninsula but he hasn\u0092t seen any tracks or heard anything in the area. He said at first he thought it probably was a poacher but when he thought about it, he felt a poacher would have been taking a lot of risk to kill a deer so close to a residential area. He also added that there was no gut pile. The carcass location was 1.5 to 2 miles to the southeast of the track location. He was asked, \u0093What if it was a poacher with a bow?\u0094 He felt that for someone to do that and kill two deer in the same location that would be highly unlikely.  He\u0092d have to hit both of them with one arrow or kill them in different areas and drag one of them to the other\u0092s location.  Speaking with another investigator, he mentioned that if a poacher killed the deer he would have most likely taken just the tenderloin and left the rest of the deer.",
