John offered that a nearby neighbor experienced a big loss of horse grain from proteced storage during that same time. This and other described events are consistent with observations at other active sites. John was receptive to the idea of encouraging future visitation by making attempts to 'provision' the visitors.  Therefore, John will oblige the suspected creatures by making food items available.  He will observe, and report on future developments should they occur. John will also request of nearby neighbors that they be watchful and that they report relevant observations.  John and his father are longstanding members of their rural community.Please note: Sites of ongoing activity are not ordinarily posted. We are sensitive to recent claims that all bigfoot evidence was somehow hoaxed by a person now deceased. This developing situation near Pilot Rock, Oregon is therefore of particular interest for it post-dates the demise of Ray Wallace. Please refrain from making uninvited visits to a potentially important site. Updates will be posted as they unfold.Thom PowellBFRO/Oregon",

            "Observed": "I want to start with tonight, while it is fresh in my mind. My girlfriend and I let the dogs out to the bathroom around 1am. She instantly said she thought she heard something in the valley below our home, and shined a flashlight down into the valley. I looked, and my German Shepherd was looking across the valley as well. I figured it was probably a deer, and we walked on out into the yard. I notice the German Shepherd was sticking close to her and her little dog. He seems to think it is his job to protect them both, and does quite well. So it isn't so unusual for him to follow them, but it was just a little odd at how close he was staying to them. I had forgotten to close the shutters on my chicken coop, (I have shutters that close over the wire) so I walked over to my garage and went behind it to the coop. As I was walking around the garage I heard this loud call/howl. I can not, in any way, shape, or form, even remotely able to describe it by typing this out. I can still hear it in my head, but would be lucky to even try to mimic the sound. It called out once, kind of low, then so loud it filled the area, but with the same vocalization both times. It was so out of place that my girlfriend instantly went into the house with her little dog, and I came back to the yard to check on them. She left the little dog in the house and came back out. She told me the little dog actually ran to the door and wanted in the house when he heard it. I downplayed it to a point, so as not to frighten her any more than she already was. We went back into the house and I got my other dog, and put his leash on him. He is kind of a problem dog, and I have to take him out separate from the other two. He sometimes goes wild on the leash, jumps, pulls and tugs etc... trying to get to our cats (which were no where to be found tonight) and it is just a lot easier to take him out alone. He behaved perfectly tonight, and just kept looking for something out in the darkness. He actually acted as if he didn't even want to go out at first. Just a few minutes after taking him outside, the calls started again. This time they were a little further from my home. The first time they were on the hill opposite my home, maybe a hundred yards away. The second time they were maybe two hundred yards away, and I could hear the cattle in the field closest to them calling out for each other and sending out their alarms. The calls kept up for a good two or three minutes, and quite frankly sounded like some sort of challenge. One of my neighbors has a bunch of hunting dogs they keep outside. They normally bark and go off at anything and everything. Tonight, you wouldn't have any idea they were even there. Not one of them made as much as a whine. They were completely silent.",
