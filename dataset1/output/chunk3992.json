            "Follow-Up Report": "  I met the witness in person during the course of an expedition to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. She came forward to tell what she had witnessed when she was 20 years old. She was serious and direct to the point about what she had seen. She reminded me of a grandmother who wouldn\u0092t hesitate to put her grandkids in place if they got out of line.  She was traveling east on a straight away on M-69 3-5 miles east of M-95 at about 3:00 PM on a sunny day in June or July of 1965. She clearly saw an upright figure on two legs moving up the embankment to the road to cross to the other side. It was moving from North to South in front of her 1/8 (220 yards) of a mile away. It took 4 steps to go across the 2 lane highway. At first she thought it was a hunter but it had no gun. It went down the other side of the embankment which was the width of a car lane and disappeared into the brush.  It had hands that hung down to its knees and it had a swinging motion similar to a person. She watched the black hair covered figure for 5 seconds as it crossed the road with long relaxed strides. It moved in no hurry. It didn\u0092t look in her direction when it crossed the road. In relation to the trees on the side of the road it looked like it was 8 feet tall or more. \"It looked big.\"     When she first saw it she stopped her car. She locked her car doors after it went out of sight. She waited 10 seconds and she drove to the area she thought it crossed. She carefully looked for the spot it exited and entered the brush. She turned around twice looking for the spot but couldn\u0092t find anything.There were no other cars on the road at the time when she saw it. The land on both sides of the road was lowland terrain with thick dense foliage of bush and trees.  I asked her, \u0093What about it told you it wasn\u0092t human?\u0094. She thought a few seconds and said, \u0093It was too big to be human and the strides were so long.\u0094",

            "Observed": "While this incident occurred a long time ago, it may be ofsome use, as I have never heard of any such sighting in North Dakota. Whilecoming back from a hunting trip outside of Minot, North Dakota in aroundthe third week of April, in 1962, a friend of mine and I were followedby a creature as we returned in the direction of the trailer park in whichwe lived. (My father was working for the Department of the Air Force onthe Missile site Installations at the time.) After walking back from somedistance out on the prairie, I had the distinct feeling that someone orsomething was following us. Eventually I became so uncomfortable that Idid look over my right shoulder and saw at a distance of about 50 yardsor so, what I thought at first was a great ape. I cannot describe to youwhat I felt at that moment. It fixed me with it's eyes and stood up onit's hind legs when it saw that it had been seen. As all I had was a singleshot .22, shooting it was out of the question. I got a real good closelook, long black shiny hair, oily looking, and it rose from all fours onto it's hind feet.(I am certain it had followed us for some time). Verytall. No hair on the face above it's nose or the palms of it's hands. Longarms. Very malevolent expression conveyed to me. I cannot overemphasizethis. It began to move in our direction. (I was with a partner). Both ofus ran as fast as we could. We didn't look back after this.",
