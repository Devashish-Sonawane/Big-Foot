            "Observed": "While driving North on U.S. 101 in Washington State my wife and myself were in the front seat of our car when we saw what at first appeared to be a big man with a back pack on his back running across the road in front of us. We saw this big man come from the right side of the road to the left side. This is a two lane road and there were no other cars around. Both sides of the road were very dense with trees and brush. The weather was cloudy but it was not raining at the time. The road was straight and the shoulders were mowed back to the woods and brush. We expected to see the big man when we got to the place he had ran across the road. But he had run directly into the brush and woods and we did not see him again. One of the passengers (from Sweden) in the back seat shouted when he saw it run into the brush. He thought it was an animal as he did not see it run across the road. When he asked what it was my wife and I told him it looked like Big Foot. It was the same color from head to foot. Ran with very big strides. Never looked to the side at us. It appeared to be hunched a little to the front as it ran.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with two of the three witnesses about their sighting. Both stated they felt very fortunate to have witnessed this animal crossing the road, although both stated they didn't believe in the existence of sasquatch before this encounter. After speaking with them for approximately thirty-five minutes, both insisted that what they saw was definitely not human nor was it a bear.They were extremely impressed that what they saw could disappear so quickly considering the dense, thick woods and brush on both sides of the road.",
