            "Follow-Up Report": "During our phone interview, the witness (JE) explained that he has spent a great deal of time in the Redfish Lake area of the Sawtooth Mountains. His grandfather was a ranger in the Sawtooth National Forest for some twenty years. JE emphasized the uniqueness of both the animal calls and the fear response he had to them during his 2001 encounter.The strange calls were coming from one animal as it moved swiftly through the thick woods in the darkness. JE said he could hear twigs snapping and bushes being brushed aside in between its calls. The sounds were amazing in their volume, duration and pitch range, and sounded somewhat like the howl recordings on the BFRO website. They started out really deep and guttural (so low you could feel the sound), and then went to high, piercing and almost ear splitting levels. They were very LOUD. No reply calls were heard.JE vividly remembers the hair went up on the back of his neck and a feeling of terror swept over him as he heard the first call. As an experienced outdoorsman and now a firefighter by profession, he stated that he is not used to being scared of anything. For some reason (possibly infrasound), though, he was terrified that night.The next day, JE went to the creek bed to investigate. No discernable prints, scat or hairs were found. Together with the stalking incident and a single call heard a few nights earlier by others, these events indicate the presence of a large, dark nocturnal visitor. Based on his experience, JE does not believe the calls could have come from any of the usual suspects: mountain lion, wolf, bear, or man. The stalker was large and dark, so that eliminates all except brown bears and man. Grizzlies have not been seen in the area for decades and a man pacing humans on the road while scrambling along a ridge in the dark would be highly unlikely.",
