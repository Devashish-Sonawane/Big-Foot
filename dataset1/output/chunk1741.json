            "Follow-Up Report": "On 9/17/9 I met this witness at his place of employment whereupon we proceeded in a golf cart to the location of his sighting. It was through a locked gate and onto a very large property that is now owned by the City of Jacksonville, Fl. but was formerly Cecil Field, a large USN airbase. The location of the sighting was between a quarter, and a half mile from his work place. The sighting took place as the witness crossed perpendicularly, a cleared right of way that was lined on both sides by slash pine sapling about 3'-5' tall. We walked back to the approximate location of the animal during the sighting. The witness demonstrated how the animal appeared when be backed up and saw it the second time, crouching behind a pine sapling of about 5' in height, bending down a branch, and peering between the needles of the trunk and the bent down branch. He stated this brief \"stare down\" lasted about 3-4 seconds, whereupon the creature darted to its left and ran into the thick brush. The witness stated that he caught glimpses of it bobbing through the brush as it ran away and had the distinct impression that it was exhibiting bipedal locomotion. The witness did not check for tracks, in that he was somewhat shaken and did not feel compelled to do so.We then went to the site of the second encounter that occurred a few weeks later, which was between the original sighting and the work place, where he recounted that second experience. During this time the witness stated that on the second encounter, the \"feeling\" of being watched and the \"hair on end\" was definitely directional, from behind and to his left. This produced an immediate fear response in him, causing him to look in the direction of the \"feeling\" where he saw nothing. It should be noted here that no sound whatsoever caused this reaction, but that it was spontaneous and occurred while he was walking. This experience is very common among witnesses, and is particularly interesting in that regard, in that it was spontaneous and without being triggered by a sight or sound out of the ordinary.Of further particular interest in this report is the fact that the witness was previously employed by the Jacksonville Zoo for several years, prior to his current employment, and worked in the primate area about one day per week, maintaining a temperamental air conditioning system. He stated that he had a particular interest in the primates, and became familiar with their identities as to type, looks, smells, and behaviors. He stated that the subject of his visual encounter was very much like a bonobo, a kind of chimpanzee. Concerning its observed physical characteristics, the witness could recall the following;-As the creature appeared to be squatting flatfooted on its haunches with one arm raised in the first view, the arm appeared to be longer in proportion to the torso than that of a human.-The witness described the creature as being slender.-While the creature appeared black, no hair or fur could be readily discerned, but he felt sure it was hairy.-No ears were visible.- It appeared that the creature\u0092s knees were protruding somewhat away from its torso in the squatting position.While no adult creatures were seen by this witness, if this was a very young juvenile Sasquatch, it is likely that the mother was very close by. It may very well be that the witness\u0092 second experience involved an adult. This geographic area borders Jennings State Forest where numerous other sightings have been reported and investigated by this investigator. It would be no far fetch for these properties to be overlapping territories of Sasquatch creatures. They are large wild areas of pine flatwoods, with mosaics of bottomland hardwood swamps, ponds, creeks, and streams interspersed, which support large populations of big game animals, including wild hogs, deer, panthers and alligators.",
