            "Follow-Up Report": "8/26/07 I spoke with the reporting witness, D, today and learned a couple additional details about the trail of footprints he and his friend Tim found. In the report, D mentions that his boot was much smaller than the individual footprints. He wears a size 10 1/2 boot for reference. He also remarked how amazed he was at the distance between prints. He said he would have had to leap from left to right to even come close to matching the print-maker's walk. D remembered that he and Tim carefully examined several prints and could see no evidence of rear feet overstepping front feet (as bears sometimes do). They became convinced that the tracks had been made by a very large individual walking on two legs.Lastly, D reiterated how remote the area was where the tracks were found. He and Tim had not seen any sign of other people exploring the winter woods. The wilderness is vast and the human population small in this northern part of Idaho, particularly in the winter.I asked if Tim, the other witness, would be willing to talk to me. D said he thought so, but unfortunately the two had lost contact with each other after D moved out of state. D offered to try to find contact information for Tim by checking with mutual acquaintances.D now lives in California. He thanked us for the work we are doing and said he hopes it will lead to protection for this unique species. I invited him to join the BFRO on an expedition and mentioned the upcoming November one to the Sierra Nevada Mountains. D said he would like that and will see if he can fit one into his schedule this year or next.",
