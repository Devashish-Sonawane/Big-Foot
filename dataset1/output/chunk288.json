The witness told me that the incident happened on private land that is located approximately fifteen miles north of the Red River. To the south across the Texas state line is Pat Mayes Lake, and an area with a history of reported bigfoot encounters. The witnesses stated that the animal was dark in color, probably brown with a large white or light gray patch across the chest area up to the shoulders and onto the arms. The witnesses felt neither threatened nor particularly alarmed or frightened. They said that the animal was not in the least bit aggressive and just seemed to be momentarily curious about them. The witnesses felt no inclination whatsoever to shoot the animal.The submitter of the report had an earlier encounter in the same vicinity when he was younger. He and another cousin found several footprints that seemed to be from several different animals, perhaps a family. He took photos of the tracks, but has not seen the photos in a while. He will attempt to find the photos and forward them on to me. He said the photos are of a good quality.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The gentleman who filed this report is in law enforcement in Pasco County.  I spoke with him several times by phone, and it turns out we have a friend in common. On this evening the three witnesses were outside a rural home in Wesley Chapel. They were standing by his car, talking, while he lightly strummed his guitar. It was 1 or 2AM and they had only been outside for approximately 15 minutes. Google earth image of the location:Out of the corner of his eye, the witness saw movement coming from between the houses in the cul de sec. He questioned out loud to his friends, \u0093What is that?!\u0094 Under the street light, less than 50 yards away they watched a 7ft, dark, hairy, bipedal human figure run across the cul du sec, going east to west. The female in the group screamed, yet the figure never looked their way. It had a conical head, very long arms, and a very wide torso. The witness does not think it could be a person in a costume as it was just too \u0093huge\u0094 to be. Nor does he think someone could have run that particular way hindered by a suit. The arms were swinging as it ran. The witness is clear that it had 3 to 4 inch dark hair. They all felt great fear; the girl running into the house, the boys jumping into the car and driving away at great speed. Once out of the neighborhood; they agreed that they had just seen a bigfoot. They never smelled odors, nor heard footsteps when it ran.The winter of 2010 in the Tampa area was the coldest on record. Not only did they have a record set for most consecutive days with freezing temperatures, the average temperature was 52 degrees - 10 degrees colder than normal. A week before this sighting the area had experienced a hard freeze, which was very unusual.This neighborhood is very rural. There have been many reports in this area. Report #24266 is 5 miles away, Report #15361 is 8 miles away, and Report #42978 is 10 miles away. These reports run along the same green way along with Reports #35053 and 26377 which are further south. This area has a very strong history of activity. ",
