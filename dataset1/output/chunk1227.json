            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the daughter, who in this case actually submitted the report, and the mother, who actually saw the creature on two occasions; once behind her house and once very briefly while driving home. The witness (mother) said that when her brother first told them of what he had seen, the family believed that he had perhaps been drinking a bit much and they made light of his encounter. However, when she turned around that night behind her house to see a large, hairy, bipedal animal standing there, staring at her, the witness immediately realized that her brother was telling the truth. The witness described the animal as standing beside her husband's truck, and its head was just above the side mirrors, which would put it at approximately eight feet in height. It was the witness's impression that the creature was curious about the truck, because it was standing directly next to it. The witness recalled the animal's color as a \"light gray from head to toe.\" It had hair that was about \"three or four inches\" long all over its body, and the hair hung down to its eyes. Apparently, the porch light caused the eyes of the animal to have the appearance of \"glowing red.\" The witness remembered distinctly that the animal did not at all seem aggressive or threatening, and just seemed to be standing there in a slightly slumped stance. Even so, the witness still had a feeling of great fear and rushed back into the house, slamming the door. The face of the animal was \"like a human, but also like a monkey.\" However, the face was flat like a human without a protruding chin like a chimp or orangutan. The witness remembered that its nose was flat. The sighting lasted a few seconds before the witness hurriedly fled into the house. The witness said that her encounter was at a distance of about twenty five feet and was perhaps close enough that if the animal wanted to harm her, it could easily have done so. On another occasion, about a week later, the witness saw the same animal at the creek as she drove and her lights illuminated it. She remarked that at that time, she remembered the animal putting up a hand, seemingly to block the light. The witness told me that on occasion, they have heard unfamiliar growling howls originating from down the creek at night. She is confident that the sounds are from the same animal, or another of its kind. The property is only a few miles from the Lavaca River. I asked the witness if she knew of anyone else in her area who had ever seen anything like what she saw. The witness was certain that she was not the first to have seen the animal or others like it. Apparently, there have been sightings of similar animals in the area for many years. The witness said that the locals referred to the animal(s) as the \"Navidad Wildman.\" The witness said, \"We have them down here - Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever you want to call it - I'm living proof.\"",
