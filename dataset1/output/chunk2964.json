            "Observed": "I had gotten up in the middle of the night to get a drink. After leaving the kitchen, I went to the backdoor to look out the window. There is a road about 100 yards from the back of my house with a dusk to dawn light that is still in the same location today. As I stood there I noticed something start up the bank toward the road from our field. It cleared the road in one stride. I can not give any clear physical dimensions because of the distance and being night, but because of the dusk to dawn light I could tell that it was not a man, it had wide shoulders and long arms, and was hairy. I stood there frozen for a moment, and kept looking to see if it would return. After a few moments, I went back to bed. But this does not end here. The next day I went next door to my great grandmother`s house to check on her. During our conversation, she looked at me and said, \"I started to call you last night\". \"What for\" was my response. \"Someone was standing outside my window around 3:00 AM\". When she said this the hair stood up on my neck. Before I could say anything else, she looked me square in the eye and said, \"He was big. He was as tall as the top of my window\". You need to understand, my great grandmother`s home was built in the late 1800`s, and had the old, four foot tall windows. I stand 6`-3\", and the top of the window (inside the house) was over my head. Outside, from ground level, this person would had to have been close to eight foot tall! I then proceeded outdoors, where I found a large section of grass had been flattened outside her window. There was only one footprint, and it was in the direction it would have been walking to the road. The print was approximately 18\" long, and about 8\" wide. I never told my great grandmother what I saw the night before, and to my knowledge, she never mentioned this to anyone else. This incident is as clear today as it was 28 years ago. I never heard any stories from anyone else in the area. I have kept trying to play this off as a hoax, but it just doesn't make sense. Why would someone go to all that trouble to hoax a sighting for the possibility of being seen by one 88 year old woman?",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness, M.H., for nearly an hour on the phone, the following details can be added to this report:When the witness looked out his window, he saw motion in his peripheral vision and turned in time to see a tall, upright creature swiftly scale the very steep road bank.The creature stepped up the bank, estimated to be 8 feet high, and placed a foot at the top, on the road grade. It reached out with its right hand and gripped the concrete rail of a small bridge abutment, then fluidly swung up onto the road. In one stride, its opposite foot stepped across the two lane road, Appalachian Drive, far enough that with the very next step it was descending the steep bank on the opposite side and disappearing from view. M.H was impressed with the creature's swift and fluid movement up a bank that he often climbed with difficulty.The entire observation lasted 5 seconds and was well illuminated by a street light immediately adjacent to the scene. At last sight the creature was travelling west, toward the Smith River.As the creature moved across the road the witness was approximately 75 yards away. He had a good enough view to add the following details about its physical description: -it had no neck, the head blended straight into the shoulders-the shoulders were very wide, half as wide as the creature was tall -it was thick wasted, broad from shoulders to hips, not tapered like an athlete-it was a very bulky creature-the arms were very long-the hand gripped the cement bridge rail, using it for leverage-during the arm swing, the hand passed close by the knee-the creature was covered in fur or hair-the weight was estimated at 750-800 pounds-the hair color was black under the street lightIn the morning his great grandmother greeted him in an uncharacteristically serious manner and told him something big had been outside her window at 3 a.m. the night before. It stood upright and its head reached the top of her bedroom window. She repeated, \"it was big\". From the outside of her home, the top of that window is about 8 feet above ground level. Her story jarred M.H. given his experience and the coincidence in timing. He went outside to look around and from her window he walked toward the bridge abutment. He quickly came to a ploughed field and found a very large footprint. It was estimated at 18 inches long, 8 inches wide, and impressed in the soil about 1 1/2 inches. The human-like track was flat, showed no indication of an arch, and had five clear toes. The big toe was very pronounced. M.H. was too un-nerved by the first track to look for more and ceased to pursue the matter further.After our conversation I used Google street view to examine the scene of the incident, and confirmed M.H.'s description of the environment. The bridge abutment described above carries Appalachian Drive over Daniels Creek, and the street light is immediately south of the bridge.",
