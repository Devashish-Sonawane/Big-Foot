You have a tendency to notice things more when something strange like this happens to you!  The bigfoot did appear to be following a deer trail that was heading across the road.",

The creature's arms were longer proportionally than a human's, which it did not swing when it walked, but rather held them loosely at its side.  Although it was dusk, he was able to judge that the hair was a darker tone, definitely not white or light brown, and was rather long somewhat like an Irish setter.  (While witnesses have trouble estimating hair length, they can usually say whether the hair was somewhat short like a bear or long like an Irish setter, which is why this specific description occurs frequently in my reports.)The witness also reported that in the past decade, on two or three occasions when he was visiting his parents, he has had very definite feelings of being watched - to such a degree that it has caused the hairs on his arms to stand up",
