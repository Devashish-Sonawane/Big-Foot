I was just getting home from work one night after I closed, it was about 11 and I like to see the deer just to see what we have around my house. And in the upper left hand corner of my yard about 25 yards away from my deer lick I saw a big figure about 7' maybe 8' tall. I was thinking it was a poacher in the yard killing deer. So I turned my brights on and started walking toward the figure. As I was walking I started to smell kinda like a smell of body odor and mildew smell and I was scared when I realized it wasn't a hunter. It took off down a game trail in the brush. I also need to say I'm not hunting off the lick, and the deer run when I pull up. I wasn't walking over there with a group of deer. But to continue, the next day I walked back into the woods and looked. There is a bunch of nesting spots for deer and a spot where it looks like a rock bed that smelled awful, like death.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness on 10/29/2012. The following is in addition to the above report. The encounter lasted between 3-4 minutes. As he returned home from work, he saw the figure crouched down near his deer lick. As stated, he first thought it was a \"poacher dressed in a ghillie suit\", and he hit his brights in his vehicle and got out and walked towards the \"poacher\". He then froze in his tracks upon realizing it was not a human. At that point the bigfoot slowly stood up and they just stared at each other for at least (what seemed) like 2 minutes or more. Estimated height was 8ft tall. Measurement is based on the known height of the trees the bigfoot was near. Witness is 6'6\" tall and he is taller than some of the trees (saplings) and this bigfoot was considerably taller than the trees. The bigfoot was built \"like a body builder\" and the arms were \"very close to 2ft wide\". Witness is very tall and slender and he thought the arms \"were very nearly as wide as I am\". There was eye reflection.  The hair color was reddish brown, or \"deer colored\". His description of the smell is self explanatory. As stated, they have had dogs and a cat with a new litter all disappear over the last two years. No physical or visual evidence to link that to Sasquatch. His younger brother has mentioned on several occasions the horrible stench after coming in from feeding the animals at night. I asked him about the bed of rock where he described  an awful smell. The bed of rock is where rocks and small boulders have come to rest over the years as they tumble/fall from a rocky hill, naturally made. ",
