            "Observed": "My stories begin in the mid 70's at Indian Lake, in Eastern Oregon. It was during the summer youth camp-out. One night at the camp fire, there was this strange yell coming from down the mountain from the face of the dam. I asked and asked but was ignored. The strange yell was getting closer. Suddenly the counselors decided it was time for everyone to go to bed. Once in our teepee, I asked our lead counselor what the strange sounds were. She whispered quite rudely to be quiet and go to sleep. Later that night I was awakened bysomething. I wasn't sure what had awoken me but then the ground seemed to be shaking. Like boom, boom, boom, boom. I was just about the sit up to peek under the teepee when I was grabbed by my arm by my counselor. She hissed at me to be still. The next morning everyone acted like nothing happened! I was so confused. We broke camp pretty fast that day.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "The camp is a retreat for youths from the Umatilla Indian Reservation. There were many kids there, ages between 8 and 16 and about a dozen counselors, sleeping in teepees at night. In the context of daily activities like swimming, rafting and boating on the lake, the substantial noise might have been an attractant. The intial vocalization consisted of moaning screams, each about 5-6 seconds in duration, at least a dozen in number, stretching over an hour. The witness belongs to the Umatilla Tribe and reports that the existence of the sasquatch, called \"stick Indian\" or Ste-ye-ha-mah in the Sahaptic language, seems to be common knowledge among the older folk, who counsel a wiser live-and-let-live relationship towards the sasquatch than is often evidenced by their Anglo neighbors.The most recent reported sasquatch activity at Indian Lake occurred near the beginning of September '06. Time of this report is mid-September '06.",
