            "Observed": "My Boss and I work in forestry, were in the field allmost every day. We were working in this remote part of a Indian Reservation forested allotment. we were resurveying property lines and getting ready for a timber harvest. well this day we were resurveying the south side of this allotment heading east we were measuring every 100ft for a distance of 1320 ft. at approximate 11:00 a.m we kept hearing something following us eather behind us or our left or right it stayed approximate 100 to 250ft away from us. there was this stench  real heavy oder that we kept smelling near us. I kept blamming my boss that he had crapped in his pants and he kept accusing me of doing the same he said theres only two of us out here and I know I didnt do it. well anyway we were taking a break from hacking through the brush with our machete and we were leaning against this 200 plus old growth blowdown fir tree. I took a cigarette out and lit up, and then there was this branch or twigs breaking like something large walking through the underbrush about a 120ft away. I could not find any rocks to throw in that direction but found a u shaped piece of wood that I throw near the spot where we heard the sounds. ( take note of piece of u shaped wood because in another encounter a few years later and only a couple of months ago I had that same piece thrown at me) it got quite like I said it was cloudy and kinda dark under the tree canopy. the noise came from the other side of this large salmonberry bushes then all of a sudden the clouds broke open and aloud some daylight through behind the bushes about 10ft so that the four creatures that were watching us you could see their shadow. I told my boss mike to take a look in that direction but because of his bad eye sight he could not see that well. there were two realy big adult males one skinny tall female with shoulder lenght hair and she had a bad hump on her back her breast were like a realy old women and she kept ringing her hands together as she was speaking to the other males. there was a child to her left that stood about 6ft tall but was dwarft by the three larger adult creatures. the two males stood still motionless they watched me and did not talk much to the female that was doing most of the talking in her own dialect the males seamed to motion to her to keep quite then the clouds had covered up the rays of light and it got dark again. my boss mike kinda had seen the shadows but tried to convince me it was his boss ken and some secretarys that he brought out into the woods that sometimes he does. right after that they kept following us and my boss mike got spooked and said lets get out of here and come back next week to finnish our survey.",

We arrived at a campsite about 7:15pm and as we were sitting on a picnic table, we looked out over a small pond and noticed a leaf on a tree fluttering very fast, as if someone was intentionally doing it. There was absolutely no wind at all. To the right of this leaf was a very large black mass moving back and forth methodically. It was between a couple of medium size trees, blocking out the background behind it. The sun was hitting the exact spot, and you could clearly see a large black mass of at least 7 feet tall, and 4 feet wide just swaying back and forth...we both witnessed this from about 30 yards or less, and my wife said the face looked like a gorillas...all I could focus on was the immense size of the body...this is not the first time we had encountered something.

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and his wife live on a remote property in a rural area of McKean County near Bradford.  Over the past several years, they have experienced a number of interesting occurrences including two brief visual encounters near their home.  In speaking to both witnesses, the husband and wife both observed a large dark figure, with a \"gorilla-like\" face, observing them while swaying methodically  from the shadows at a distance of thirty yards this past August.  This recent sighting prompted the husband and wife to contact the BFRO and led to the details within this report.The couple stated that they had started to notice and discuss late night vocalizations past midnight in the woods near their home.In August of 2013, the wife was driving home on a wet and rainy night when she saw a large black figure in the head lights leap across the driveway in two steps.  She noted that she clearly saw that it was bipedal and was traveling on two legs with a distinguished leaping motion.  It leaped across the ditch to the side of the drive, landed on both feet in the center of the driveway.  It then bounded a second time and disappeared into the darkness of the woods.  It happened so quickly that she could only describe a dark, large black figure jumping across the driveway.  She described the encounter to her husband and they began to research the possibility of Bigfoot in Pennsylvania online.  The husband stated that he had been interested in the subject since he was a child.As a result of their research, they began to give their experiences to date more credence, especially the recent large figure crossing their driveway at night.   As the late night vocals continued, they began to hear knocking sounds coming from the woods behind their house.  The couple then began to more earnestly explore the woods in the daytime looking for evidence and signs.In November of 2013, they again heard vocalizations at night near their home.  After hearing screams around 4 AM, the husband ventured out into the woods the following day on November 6th and found several tracks.  He measured the tracks and they measured 14.5\" - 15\" with a width of 5\".  Here is one of the photos:One evening past midnight in August of this past year, the husband heard activity in the yard while lying in bed.  It had rained heavily and he was awakened by the sound of heavy footfalls that could be heard from the bedroom.  The witness described that he could audibly hear the \"squishing\" of the water from its footsteps.  The dog that was on the bed had its hair bristling and standing up. The next morning, the witnesses found deep impressions in the yard 15' from the bedroom.  Here are a couple photos of the impressions:There is a healthy bear population in the area, its hard to say for sure what made these. The witnesses described finding green tree breaks/twists and a stick structure they found strange in the area after this event.  Within the past month, objects have started to be thrown at the house.  One recent night in August, around 3 AM, the husband was woken by the sound of something hitting the side of the house.  The next morning, he found a stone approximately the size of # 2 gravel laying next to the house.The couple described that after this event, the family dog has began to act strangely.  The mixed breed pup has begun to stare out the window in the evening for periods of time.  They would look into the woods to study the area but were not able to see anything.On August 19, 2014, the couple decided to take a walk in the woods to look for anything peculiar.  There is a camp site in the nearby woods on private property.  The site has a pond, a picnic table, and a fire ring.  Around 7:15 PM, the couple were sitting across from each other at the picnic table.  The female witness noticed the fluttering of leaves from the nearby treeline.  As the moving foliage caught her attention, she then noticed the form of a very large dark creature peeking through the trees at them at a distance of thirty yards.  She could see the creature from the waist up and it was swaying back and forth in the shadows.  She described the creatures face as \"like a gorilla\".  The lady witness then told her husband to slowly look into the woods over his shoulder.  He briefly saw the dark figure swaying methodically and then it seemed to step back into the shadows to disappear without a sound.I interviewed both witnesses.  They described the creature as dark in color with a height at a minimum of 7' tall.  Only the Mrs. saw the face of the creature.  The man stated that he was initially focused on the body and its size.  They described very broad shoulders four feet across.  They saw hair hanging in its silhouette and could see that it was moving in a swaying motion.  The man and his wife were surprised at how it seemed to \"melt away or vanish\" so quickly and without any sound.  I inquired about the eyes of which they were not able to provide any details.  It does not appear the the creature decided to show or reveal itself and was watching them at the picnic table from the woods.  The witnesses feel that their activities and encounters seem to be seasonal occurring at the same time of the year.Their property is located down a long drive and is surrounded by woods.  There is a pool and a shed near the house.The witnesses were very pleasant, forthright, and honest.  In speaking with them concerning their experiences, they do not feel threatened by their visitors.  They also feel that there is more than one due to the vocalizations, tree knock communication, and varying sizes of track evidence.  Their dog continues to act strangely and the couple continue to keep attuned to the activity in the area.I spoke to him this past week and he stated that they continue to hear vocalizations in the evening.  Due to the activity seeming to occur in the fall, we discussed his feeling that the creatures were in the area for the late summer - early summer corn and apple crop.  The incidents seem to halt when the Pennsylvania deer season starts in late November.  I encouraged him to contact me with any recurring activity.",
