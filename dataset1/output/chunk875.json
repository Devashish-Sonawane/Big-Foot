I paced off about 40 yards to where the creature was and noticed a large print where the thick moss was torn in the shape of a foot. I took a picture. We never walk to this spot, and to tear the thick moss would be a heavy creature. I stood at this spot and my son stood from where he saw it.  I raised my hand to where my son said to stop for its height. I am 6ft and my hand was a foot above my head.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the father of the witness (a 9 year-old boy) by telephone on July 15. The father was eager to discuss the experience and curious to learn more about experiences he and his family have been having on their property. The father submitted the report on behalf of his 9 year-old son who had the sighting. I spoke with both the father and the son. The son was outside with his mother helping her with yard work. He wandered off from his mother, towards the woods, and noticed a large, dark figure with its back towards him. He said that it turned to face him and he looked back at it. He said the face was gray and brown and hairless. He said he felt scared and excited and ran back to his mother.There was not enough detail in the photo that was taken of the possible foot impression so it is not included in this report. The family is diligently using game cameras in the hopes of capturing something of interest. The family has lived at this location since 2011. The property backs up to state-owned land that is heavily forested and hilly. There are power lines and wild raspberries on the property. A creek is located approximately a mile from the house. The father said that in 2012, there were many deer that would come onto their driveway during the day. He commented that they do not see the deer on the driveway anymore. The father recently noticed a musty odor near his tree stand. The mother often has a feeling that she is being watched when she is outside. They have heard grunting, moaning, and something like a \"shush\". In addition, the family has heard bipedal footsteps close to their residence.I believe the father and son are credible. The father is a fisherman and hunter and loves to spend time outdoors. The son was delightful to talk with and did not deviate from his story. ",
