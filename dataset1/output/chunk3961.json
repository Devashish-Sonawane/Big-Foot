The creature was coming up from a field and drainage ditch and from the vicinity of a small farm pond.  At the time the east side of the farm was heavily wooded and far fewer houses existed in the area.  Principally three farmers farmed the land in and around this area to the south and east of the farm.  On the otheside of the water shed or drainage at the time was forest wood lots and abandon farm fields.  The land is hilly and the Ohio River is only several miles south of there.  In the years since this incident, the land east and south of the farm has been developed.  More houses and people now exist along the roads, a power plant was built just south of Chrisney near Rockport Indiana.  Also the land east was heavily stripped mined for coal.",
