            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness remarked on how human the subject's face was and how it displayed real \u0093intelligence\u0094 in its demeanor. Eric referred to the subject as having a charcoal-walnut appearance to the skin of the face. Upon first contact with the Sasquatch it turned its entire body to view Eric standing on the hill above it at a range of 50 yards. He remarked how the brows of the creature lifted up and its eyes were wide in an apparent state of bewilderment and then lowered with the side of its mouth moving slightly, before turning around again and continuing to stare at the water on Discovery Bay. Eric recounted having felt a \u0093connection\" with the Sasquatch as if it felt comfortable with him standing where he was, despite Eric holding a shotgun in his hand. It wasn\u0092t until Eric began to shout to his friends to run up and see what he was observing that the Sasquatch turned around again. Eric remarked that it displayed a body language message of \u0093ok, now your being disrupting\u0094 and proceeded to leave, giving Eric a view of its massive gait as it stepped from the top of a stump it had been standing on and cleared 7 feet with unhurried grace. After running down to the location of where the Sasquatch exited, they could see that it had gone through very dense thicket, bramble and trees, of which he remarked that a human could never penetrate on their own. They could hear the sound of snapping branches and crunching shortly after it retreated and then the area fell silent. The witness believed that it had decided to hide shortly after, laying low in the brush as they only heard it for a short time during its retreat.In talking with Eric, I found the experience so compelling that I went to the location to attempt to collect data or pictures of the area and found much of the location was now private property and gated logging roads. From the physical orientation of the location alone, one could correlate that that sighting was authentic due to a corridor of sightings that have taken place in similar locations around the Olympic Peninsula.
