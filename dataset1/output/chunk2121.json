The slag heaps undulate as they go, rising upwards near twenty-five feet and then dropping back down again like a series of small hills. Great for mountain biking. In between these small hills are small pools of collected water from rainfall, which serve as excellent locales for frogs and tadpoles to live or other animals to drink from. The hills themselves are composed of clay with broken shale serving as small spines sticking out from the surface, not a place you want to walk barefoot through, which I have, only to have my feet sliced open time and time again.",
