            "Follow-Up Report": "This is one of those investigations where I came away knowing sasquatch is real. I talked for about an hour by phone to the man who submitted this report, \u201cJohn\u201d (46 years old), and to his brother, \u201cJoe\u201d (50), the other witness. Both men impressed me as intelligent, normal, and utterly sincere as they described the sighting and their reaction to it \u2013 an unsettled fear and upset that such a thing is out there.John figured the sound of the shoals drowned out the sounds of their approach.  He said, \u201cWe seen something move and\u2026 there was this\u2026 I don\u2019t know what\u2026 I mean, our hearts just stopped! This thing had its back to us\u2026\u201d The men and the creature were standing in about knee-deep water. \u201cHis arms looked like they were, I don\u2019t know\u2026 four foot long\u2026 almost down to his knees. And it was just splashing, just hitting the water very forcefully with his hands\u2026 We were frozen and\u2026 he never knew we were there.\u201d \u201cIt had wide broad shoulders on it\u2026 and its neck looked like\u2026 it didn\u2019t have a neck. It looked like its head and shoulders were all one.\u201d The waist area seemed more narrow. He couldn\u2019t describe the legs really except to say they went down into the water and didn\u2019t seem too long. I believe he meant the legs weren\u2019t as proportionally long as the arms seemed to be. The creature was a brownish, blackish, reddish, John said. More reddish where the neck would be and then darker again on top of the head. And he said its hair looked like a real full coat of hair, not a short hair by any mean but a long hair. Joe described the hair color as chocolate. John said it looked real healthy.The only explanation for the creature\u2019s splashing that John could offer was that it was trying to cool itself. Joe didn\u2019t seem to notice the splashing after the creature came into sight like John did; he\u2019d certainly heard it as they were walking toward it, but didn\u2019t seem to have seen or remembered the splashing once the creature came into view. He didn\u2019t have much to say about the actual sighting generally \u2013 the way it looked, what it was doing \u2013 and I didn\u2019t push him. Talking about it was obviously unpleasant for him.After 30 seconds (at least, said Joe) to 3 minutes (2 to 3 minutes, thought John) of watching the thing splashing the water (according to John), the creature stopped, tilted its head up, leaped to the shore, and disappeared into the vegetation. Joe said it just walked to shore like it wasn\u2019t surprised at all; \u201cIt seemed so human,\u201d he said. John thought it might have scented them, Joe said it seemed to sense they were there. Neither man was sure it ever knew they were there behind it; the creature never turned and looked at them. Neither of the brothers had any prior interest in bigfoot or knowledge beyond the basic awareness of the issue most have. They aren\u2019t particularly interested in it now either, but seeing what they saw seems to have forced them to look into the bigfoot phenomenon. John found the BFRO website; they talked it over and decided to report their sighting. The men have told only those close to them of their experience. John and Joe have hunted since they were boys; they know the woods and the animals in it \u2013 they thought. Joe said that now when he hunts deer he waits for it to get light before he goes out. And he has sleepless nights. He said the thing was \u201cinside my comfort zone\u201d about 40 yards away (John thought 25 to 30 yards), meaning it was too close. Joe mentioned that during a recent elk hunt near Yellowstone Park a grizzly bear also invaded his comfort zone; it was about 75 yards away. Joe was also bothered because aspects of the creature were so \u201chuman,\u201d and he seemed somewhat comforted and a little surprised when I told him other witnesses have said the same thing. When I told him he was lucky to have seen it, he said he wishes he hadn\u2019t and that he never wants to see another one. John made a point of saying he didn\u2019t feel in danger during the sighting.Joe also said that seeing the thing made him think back on incidents in his life that he didn\u2019t understand at the time and has come to think could have been to do with this creature \u2013 the time a neighbor called saying something was after his cattle and asking that they bring their bear dog (a Plott) and four coon hounds over right away. They did. The dogs tore straight into the woods on the fresh trail but in a couple of minutes came running back whining, totally spooked by what they\u2019d found. He\u2019s never seen anything like it; the dogs had always been fearless. And there had always been strange vocalizations heard in the area \u2013 summers, but not every year. And there were the times coon hunting at night with hounds that something very big moved around them in the woods, unseen, beyond the bounds of their flashlights. (A coon hunter in Iowa told me the same thing).I can\u2019t find anything to explain away or even cast doubt upon what these men say they saw \u2013 watched for 30 seconds or more \u2013 a stone\u2019s throw away: a big human-like, hair covered animal that stood and walked off on two legs... something that, though it well fits the description for the animal we call bigfoot or sasquatch, neither witness chose to name as such. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it was,\u201d they both replied when I had said, \u201cWell, if it wasn\u2019t a bear or a man, what do you think it was?\u201d Not only were both men certain the thing they saw was not a bear or a man, they said it couldn\u2019t have been a person in a suit; it was too big, and it looked real; and that would be real dangerous, John said, because there are \u201cgun happy\u201d people around there. This sighting took place just 50 miles from Atlanta.",

            "Observed": "The Wisconsin River runs right by my town.  I am an avid deer hunter, turkey hunter, fisherman and so on.  I have been in the woods my whole life (48 years old) in this area and I had never seen this before.  I was leaving to go deer hunting and I had just pulled onto the main highway along the river and started to accelerate when I looked down into the river bottoms where there are a lot of tops and trees and general river wash and sitting on a log was a what looked like a very large hairy man all dressed in a shaggy brown fur.  It was just coming daylight and I was doing about 20 miles an hour when I went by but its head was down in between its shoulder blades like and I remember that the legs just looked huge and the top of the head was cone shaped.  I got down to the intersection and turned around and went back but when I got back whatever was there was already gone.  There is a natural high bank bend in the river about 30 yards from where it was sitting so whatever it was could have moved under that and out of sight.  I have heard sounds that are on tape since I was a young boy coon hunting with my dad in these bottoms and my dad always said that something followed us while we were coon hunting the river bottoms but since it didn't bother us he never bothered it and that him and my uncle would often skin the coon right in the woods and leave the carcass for whatever was there.  They called the one valley north of us \"The Screaming Woman Valley\" because late at night in the late fall, early winter people used to hear screams from the bottoms that were often just put off as a bobcat or lynx.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Allen got up early to look for good deer hunting locations on this day. He left home just after daybreak and headed north on Highway 60. Just after crossing the Wisconsin River there is a lot of undergrowth and bottoms close to the road. Allen was driving slow, maybe 25 mph as he was looking over the bottoms for deer. He clearly saw a very large, dark gray figure sitting on a large log about 25 to 30 yards from the edge of the road and with its back angled towards the road. As he approached it, the figure appeared to turn its shoulders towards the road, and Allen slowed \"...way down because it seemed so out-of-place.\" The head was much larger than a person's and wasn't shaped like a person's either; rather it was cone-shaped and was set deep down between its shoulders. The hair was scraggly and was a dark gray.  What struck Allen, who has been involved with athletics for decades, was the massive size of the legs which were slowly swinging and which he could clearly see.  Allen didn't get a good look at the face because he more focused on why there was such a large thing sitting there. \"It looked like a person on a large log hunting; waiting for something to come by.\" And, being hunting season Allen didn't think it was a person dressed in a ghillie suit simply because it would be extremely dangerous to do so. Allen continued north about one quarter mile to the intersection of Highway 60 and Highway 61, turned around, and drove back to the location but it was gone - either back into the bottoms or across the road and into the woods.I found Allen, who is an avid outdoorsman and who has lived in the area his entire life, to be a very credible witness. And Allen urges other witnesses to come forward and file reports.",
