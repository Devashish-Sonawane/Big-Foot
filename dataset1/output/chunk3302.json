            "Follow-Up Report": "This report was originally submitted by the witness\u0092 son. I have spoken with both the witness and her son and can add the following details to this report:In 1996 the witness's husband and son worked as commercial fishermen on the Ohio River. The witness would drop them off, and then pick them up again at a point further down river.On the night of the sighting she was waiting in the parked truck with the headlights off. She said her son was mistaken about the creature walking in front of the headlights. Although the moon was not full, there was enough moonlight to make things fairly visible.The creature came out of the woods about 50 feet from the truck, crossed the road and a field, and entered the tree line along the river. At one point it stopped briefly and looked around. She estimated it was over eight feet tall, stating \"it wouldn't have fit through a regular sized door.\" The body was broadest across the shoulders and narrower in the waist area. The head was \"shaped like a gorilla's,\" with no real neck visible. The witness described the creature as \u0093woolly looking.\u0094 While the witness could not see any facial details, she could see it had hair all the way down its arm and on its body and that it did not have on any clothes. According to the witness \"It walked at an unhurried pace, swinging its arms, just like a gorilla or a monkey would do.\" She said its arms were long compared to a human and probably hung down to knee level. After the sighting, the witness rolled up the windows, locked the doors and turned on the headlights because she was frightened. No vocalizations or odors were associated with the sighting.The witness' son added that he and his father heard the log breaking noises on the island on four or five different occasions.",
