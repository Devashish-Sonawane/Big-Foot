            "Observed": "It was in July 2006.  Not sure what day.  About 9:30PM.  I was walking from my garage to the house when I heard a terrible screaming in the holler at the back of our property.  I heard it again about 30 seconds later.  I have heard coyotes several times but this sound was like nothing I've ever heard.  It sent chills down my spine.  I mentioned it to my son a few days ago and he said \"you've heard that too?\"  I asked him when he heard it and he said about 3 weeks ago.  He too was walking from the garage to the house around 9:30 or 10 at night and heard a terrible screaming from the same location.  He's a very skepticle person and never thought to mention it until I did.  I remember being at the back of my property in this location in the winter of 1989 burning some brush.  I sat down and then heard a loud grunting sound about 20 feet behind me.  I thought it was probably a buck but I never saw anything and nothing ran away like a deer would have.  Also in the summer of 1988 my wife and I went to the back of the property at night just to do a little exploring.  We had just moved there and were curious what it would look like at night.  We heard something moving in the cedar trees.  It spooked us and we went back to the house.  What ever it was followed us parallel on the path in the cedars.  We never actually saw what it was.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. He has lived at the location for nineteen years now. The incident in which he felt he and his wife were trailed at night occurred shortly after they moved to the location. The \"grunt\" incident occurred a few years later.He has heard the screaming vocalization once again (late April) since he filed this original report. On this occasion he said the sound was from further away, he estimated a quarter mile, and noted \"it started all the dogs in the neighborhood barking\". He described the vocalization as \"half human, half animal\" which \"started out almost like a scream then turned into a howl from that\". As compared to the recordings posted on the BFRO website he says \"it sounded like a cross between the Ohio clip and the Mississippi clip. The moans weren't as long or extended out but it would start with somewhat of a scream and then go into a shorter moan\".He noted that what ever made the sound \"had a lot of lung power behind it\".Click the image below for a larger version.",
