            "Follow-Up Report": "This report was originally filed by the witness' wife and then after speaking with her I contacted him at a later date and spoke for about an hour.The witness is a well spoken timber man, as was his father and grandfather before him. In October of 2009 he was cutting a cherry tree on an out-of-state neighbor's 1000 acre farm. As he finished he looked over at a cedar grove approximately 200 yards away and noticed something black standing beside the trees. At first he thought it was a black bear with its left paw up on the tree. As he watched, the animal used its left hand to steady itself as it stepped down into a ditch. He saw it take a couple of steps then it was lost from his view. He watched the animal for about three minutes. He drove his log skidder over and looked at that area of the farm and found it full of caves and thickets.The witness is a large man at 6'1\" and 260 lbs. He estimates the animal was one foot wider than himself and 6 to 7 feet tall. In the past he has heard knocking in the woods as well as \"yells\". Two neighbors have also had bigfoot sightings on an adjoining property. The 1000 unoccupied property of the sighting is a posted gated area that is very private.The second sighting he had was in late winter of 2010. It was also witnessed by a retired gentleman that previously worked as a sheriff and for NASA. While driving a logging truck in the Blue Sulfur area near dusk. The gentlemen observed what looked like a human/ape squatted over drinking water with its hands from a distance of about 100 yards. The passenger (the retired gentleman) looked to the driver and said \"did you just see what I saw?\" The driver said \"what did you see?\" The passenger said \"an ape drinking water with its hands.\" The driver said \"that's what I saw too\". The witness is a lifelong hunter, living his whole life in the mountains, and his job in the woods. Of the sightings he told me \"I can tell you that what I saw was not a human and not a bear, beyond that I can't say.\"Greenbrier County is a mix of rolling farmland extending up into steep rugged mountains. The countryside is dotted with caves and is lightly populated. At present there have been more sightings in Greenbrier County than any other county in West Virginia.",
