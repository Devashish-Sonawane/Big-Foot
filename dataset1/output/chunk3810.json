This is a dirt road that leads to or near the indian reservation. There really is nothing out there but scrub, Manzanita, Oaks and pines at the higher elevations. I have hunted that area and hiked around there over the years. Many times I have been out there and knew or had some feeling of another presence. I don't mean like small animals or anything of that sort; just some unexplained feeling that someone or something has been watching me or following me. Then the Press Enterprise came out with this article some years ago, and made me wonder if what it might have been was something a bit more unusual than I had imagined at the time.",
