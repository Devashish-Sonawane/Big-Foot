            "Observed": "I was hiking thru Colville National Forest with a group of 4 other individuals. we were all very spread apart and had encountered a field, the field was surrounded by woods with a lone tree in the middle to help explain the scenario, I will say we were heading North. I was the last person to walk through the field as I approached the tree in the center of the field I heard noise from the west side of the field. I hid behind the tree and started scanning the wood line and made eye contact with what at the time I had no idea what it was. It stood at what I would guess anywhere between 7-10 ft. in length it was well concealed by the woods so I couldn't get a clear shot of the body however the fur was of a dark brown/black color. Soon my fight or flight kicked in and I ran over to where my friends were waiting for me. As I took off whatever I was looking at charged, not at me but in some direction it was LOUD and had immense power it fell a tree. Once I arrived at my friends location they asked why I made so much noise, I explained the situation and convinced myself it was a bear. as an avid outdoorsman I have seen bears and that was definitely not a bear. It had to be Bigfoot.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.While hiking, the witness heard a noise as if something was walking through brush. It was not constant. He then saw 25 to 30 yards away, a 7 to 10 foot tall figure standing in the thick bushes. It was in the shade and the witness observed it for thirty seconds. He described the hair as shaggy and not well kept. He compared it to the shaggy hair on the neck of a Golden Retriever dog. The head was rounded with no ears seen. He described the shoulders as stocky or \"boxy.\" He could not guess on the width of the shoulders. The only facial feature he recalls is dark eyes that he described as \"piercing.\"He became very nervous and ran toward his friends so he did not see the figure move or the size of felled tree. It made a lot of noise as it fell. The witness was too nervous to walk over to look for tracks. No odor was detected. The witness has been an avid outdoorsman all his life. I find him credible. ",
