            "Observed": "I was bowhunting for deer yesterday (September 17th, 2005) in the swamp bottoms of West River in Churcton, Maryland when I heard what I can only describe as jibberish hollering coming from behind the deer blind that I was in at about 100 yards or so.  It moved east to west hollering jibberish and moving closer and closer to where I was.  I unzipped the back of the deer blind to try and see with my field glasses what was making all that noise and scaring the deer away.  I saw nothing.  The sound was getting closer and I began to feel nervous even though I had permission to hunt there. Thats when the smell of damp musty roadkill mixed with dirty diapers hit me.  I had to exit the deer blind for fresh air and an overwhelming sense of fear gripped me. It was more of a safety issue that made me exit the deer blind and nock an arrow in my bow and leave the area as fast as I could before I came in contact with whatever was making the noise.  I was unnerved by the aggresive tone in the jibberish and hollering.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness provided the following information when I visited the site: The witness and his wife heard a gibberish scream while hunting in the same area the previous morning (September 16). Both of them were a bit unnerved but they dismissed the noise because it didn't continue.Sometime during the mid-morning, a deer came into the witness' sights and he was able to get a decent shot at its shoulder. According to the witness, he knew the shot wasn't perfect, but it would eventually be fatal. The witness waited 45 minutes to an hour for the deer to die and then began tracking it to recover the body. He and his wife followed the blood trail for a distance and found the feathered half of the shaft. They followed the deer\u0092s trail a bit further and found the half with the arrow head. The deer\u0092s trail ended at two large pools of blood. The witness and his wife, along with a friend who came by later in the day, searched for five or six hours and were not able to locate the deer. The witness stated he had never lost an animal in that way and was puzzled.The area where the witness had his encounter has a history of bigfoot sightings, dating back to the fifties. Locals called it the \"Chalk Point Monster\" after a point of land that stretches into the West River, near the Chesapeake Bay. Activity appears to have died down in recent years, probably due to development, but it is possible that there may be some infrequent activity today. There is still a large amount of forest and farmland, along with abundant food sources.",
