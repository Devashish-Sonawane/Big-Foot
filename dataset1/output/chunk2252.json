            "Observed": "It all started around mid May 2008. I went to feed my two pit bulls around 11:30 pm one night, me and my wife had returned home late from eating out.  While taking the dogs food to them I heard a long moan / howl coming from the woods behind my house I at first thought it was my neighbor but it just did not make sense because it actually sounded farther off in the woods than my neighbors house sits. It stopped me dead in my tracks. I started surfing the internet later on after that and came across the BFRO website and played a few vocalizations and the Ohio Moan / Howl sounded just like the one I heard.  I actually talked to a couple of investigators on the matter. Since then I have become very interested in  Bigfoot and Sasquatch sightings and news. I decided to ask my wife if she had heard or seen anything unusual around the woods and house, she asked me why and I reluctantly  told her I thought I had heard a Sasquatch in the woods. She started laughing and said \u0093 I guess they throw rocks at the house and garage too\u0094. Well my jaw dropped I asked her what she meant and she told me that the whole time I was  deployed to Iraq (2005-2006)when she would come out on the back porch to smoke at night some one would throw rocks and sticks at our garage which  is not attached to our house and sits back in the wood line some. She even had her brother come out and listen one night while he was down on vacation it freaked both of them out.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "When I spoke with the witness about his brief sighting and the other activity he mentioned in his report, he was factual and sincere. The sighting area is a sparsely populated rural area with plenty of wildlife, farmland and creeks in the vicinity. Witness stated that the approximate height of the animal to be around 9-10 feet tall from measuring a branch where he saw the animal retreating back into the wood line.The vocalization he heard in May 2008 sounded similar to an \u0093Ohio\u0094 type moan/howl approximately \u00bd mile away. The vocalization started out low, gradually getting louder, lasting about 30 seconds. Witness also made note of a few tree twists at a height of about 6\u0092 in the woods located near his property. His wife also added that while he was deployed to Iraq, on many occasions she would be on the back porch and hear small stone-like objects hit their aluminum garage.",
