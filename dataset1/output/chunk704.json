            "Follow-Up Report": "Tonight the 29th of December of 2007, Tom and his son called me from Kansas City Missouri and we then went over their sound encounter which was located on the southern end of the Sierra Mountain chain, which is located just north of Highway 14, and west of Highway 395. Tom and his son\u0092s sound encounter lasted approximately 5 to 6 seconds and it sound like a woman in pain screaming. Several minutes after the scream everything went silent. It came from higher up on a mountain ridge that was located to the south and west of them. Note there is a higher ridge that runs form the northwest to southeast and is from 8453 ft at the northern end, where Owens Peak is located, to 5212 ft at its southern end, and this is where this sound emanated. The animal had to have had a very strong and powerful voice to have had them notice this sound.This area is now becoming a historical mining area for the BLM but you can still get there in a 2 wheel drive vehicle, but a 4 wheel drive vehicle is recommended for those dirt roads. The report that the witnesses made a reference too is located less than 10 miles from their location, and it also took place during September. I know that this area has deer, chucker and quail and probably has wild pigs and turkeys.  The water is what I find to be a problem, because the creeks are usually dry at the lower elevations, and only run during the wet months, which have been seldom recently.  This area is desert at Highway 14 and gradually gets into the pinion pine trees at about the 5000 thousand foot level.The witnesses heard a simalure sound on our site, which we at the BFRO think has a high possibility of being a sound of a Sasquatch.  From where the witnesses were located to the top of the ridge that was closest to there south is approximately \u00bd mile.",

They went up into this corner where the woods and the fenceline meet and started rolling around in the dirt and barking so I got down to run the dogs off and to see what they was rolling on and when I got to the corner I could smell something that smelled like dead animal, musky and sour.  Then as I turned something across the powerline in the woods approximately 50 yards away let out this deep long growl.   I have never heard anything like this in my life so I started backing away and when I got to the path I ran to our truck. After we got home my husband and I looked up growl sounds and I never could find anything that sounded like this it was horrifying to me!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken with Pam on several occasions. Although there are several incidents mentioned in her report over the years, I am going to focus on the gifting incidents, which are intriguing and not very often reported. I will include the other events at the end of my commentary, as they are of the more \"typical\" variety and do merit mentioning, and collectively they indicate an interesting series of events.Back story is as follows: Her and her husband had been hunting the land since 2003, and they eventually bought it in 2015. They purchased 40 of the 80 acres as mentioned. Landowner had let them hunt the 80 acres previously, and also allowed them to place feeders to attract deer and other animals. They started placing feeders in different places and visiting the property more frequently after they purchased it, usually several times a week. The former landowner moved a stack of tin from an old torn down shed as he was helping them clear out some debris. Where he had moved the tin from, the grass was dead and they found an old flip phone.They weren't sure how long it had been there, but it had chew marks on it, most likely from small animals. (smaller teeth marks). Otherwise it looked like it might still work. They thought the owner of the phone might come looking for it, so they placed it on top of the remaining pile of tin. They left after filling feeders and came back the next day. The phone had been placed EXACTLY where they previously found it, right in the middle of the bare, flattened grass where they found it. This was odd, and they weren't sure how or why it got there, but they put it back on top of the tin. They returned the next day and the phone was gone, and on the bare spot, in the nearly exact spot it had been, was a piece of plastic conduit about 2 ft. long. Its getting a bit spooky for them, and since they had had previous events (and related tales of events with Sasquatch mentioned in the report), they began to wonder if this was somehow related.  They put the pipe back on the tin and returned the very next day, only to find the pipe was gone, and in its place was a small, decorative  flower shaped button. They are used mostly in mobile homes to hide the nails on the ceilings. The nail is driven through a hole in the middle. She was familiar with these little buttons and was quite certain this was what it was. So she left the button on the tin and placed a hair tie and a mint in the grass. (She had these items in her pocket). They returned the next day, and the button was gone but the hair tie and mint were still there. This entire series of events took place over about a 7-10 day period. As mentioned, they never saw the pipe or button again, but the husband did find the phone about a month or so later near the power line (clear cut) clearing. This was in the general area of her and husband's sighting of creature(s).  The distance from the pile of tin to the bare spot was about 10 feet or so, so it is mostly unlikely that the phone, or other objects, slid ten feet off a 2 foot pile.It needs to be mentioned that the owner lives(ed) in Tennessee, and though there is a home there, no one lives or stays there. It is looked after by only her and her husband from time to time to keep it up and brush hog. It is very remote, and they have never seen anyone on the property, nor any signs it is being hunted or used in any way.They, and or friends or relatives, have had other events, also mentioned in this report. One other event she did not include was a sighting by her husband in 2017 of two \"dark creatures or objects\" one taller than the other, also seen in the bigger power line clear cut at a pretty good distance. They were moving around, and his supposition was that one was sitting or squatting, which was his reasoning as to why one seemed taller than the other. It was just a \"gut\" feeling he had. There are two clear cuts, one big wide one for the main lines, and a smaller one to service the few homes around them. He also had a similar sighting three years prior, in 2014, but this was a solo creature about 7-8 ft tall.The location is \"in the boonies\" and it would appear highly unlikely that anyone would go to the trouble of pranking them out in the middle of nowhere. The logistics and timing would be a miraculous series of events to pull it off. The witnesses had had a slight interest or knowledge of Sasquatch prior to 2003, and it has become more obvious to them as the years and events have gone by that it is most likely that they exist. I do not doubt her story, as she was forthright and upfront in relating her accounts, and they did not waiver to the point I doubted her credibility. She and her husband were both spooked and excited at the same time regarding the events. UPDATE 8/16/17: From the time I first interviewed the witness, and had written the above report, she has personally seen a large creature in the clear cut. This is the same clear cut her husband had seen one, and maybe two, creatures as well. She described it as having shoulders appx. 3.5 feet wide and was squatting down in the tall weeds, and the height of it from the waist up was appx. 4-4.5 feet. She only saw from the waist up due to the tall weeds it was standing/squatting in. She was in a hurry when she saw it, as she was late for work, so there was no time for further observation or perhaps even a quick photo. When she came home, whatever she saw was no longer there. Her husband had gone out on the property to get supplies together for food plots ready when he heard a \"whoop\". When he returned to his shop, he heard a single \"knock\", from the area near the food plots he had just returned from. I mention these events as peripheral incidents to support the ongoing activity on the property. There are photos of maps of the areas for the gifting incident, as well as the sightings, embedded/included with this report. As mentioned before, though there have been numerous other incidents; growls, whoop calls, structures, sightings of solo and multiple creatures, I am concentrating solely on the gifting, as it indicates an unusual interaction that defies a rational explanation. These are three photos along with this report to help visualize locations.UPDATED 11-22-17. Since the report was originally published, they have had sightings of one and two creatures on several occasions. They are always in the clear cut shown in the photos, but at a good distance away, about a quarter mile, and usually as she is leaving for work. One was standing and the other crouching or kneeling during one sighting. Another sighting had one walking until they looked at it's direction, then it froze. The exact spot they were seen in were different each time, and there  was nothing there when they returned. They do have bear there, but being avid hunters, they are virtually certain they are not bears, both by upright movement and general stature.",
