            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to witness on telephone and have the following remarks to add.  Teenager was out on his property setting out trail cams.  His family's property of 100 acres is behind his house and is full of game to include elk that have been transplanted to Kentucky and is prospering in his part of the state.As he drove his four-wheeler to the top of a ridge that opened to a small valley on the opposite side, he noticed movement in the valley.  Shutting off his four wheeler, he saw a seven foot ape-like biped from a distance of 30 feet running quickly away from him.  He saw that it was grayish brown and had hair that draped from its arms, sides and legs as it sprinted away.  Although he didn't see its face, he heard it crashing away and watched it bowl over a small tree, crushing it as it made its escape.  He was left by himself , the air filled with a faint musky smell.The witness did not see any tracks, but he later went back to the spot where he saw it and measured a nearby tree for reference.  The creature\u0092s height is reported as seven feet.I believe that the teenager surprised the Squatch by topping suddenly over the hill on his four-wheeler, causing it to flee.  He did a good job by cutting his engine when he noticed movement, and again later when returning to the scene to take measurements.",

I stood their for a moment trying to think of what it could be. I also noticed the neighbors dogs across the street were barking loudly ,But that wasn't unusual to me, as they seem to always bark at everything.. What did make it unusual was that I not only heard the neighbors dogs from across the street but also the dogs up the gulch barking.",
