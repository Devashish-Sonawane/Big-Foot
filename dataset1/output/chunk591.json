When I stepped up on the step something came toward me so I back up to the front door and shined the flash light out back and it was a good 2ft above the deck with red eyes. It kept movin its head around tryin to get the light out of its eyes. Then it start walking away it would turn and kept looking back a us. When it moved behind my neighbor shed it stop and stick its head out from behind the shed. It was like it was seeing if we was going to follow it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone at length. She submitted the report on behalf of her elderly mother who is not able to use a computer. She and her mother observed the animal for several seconds by the light of their flashlight. The residence, while in a suburban location, backs up to a steep mountain ridge that runs for several miles in a North-South direction. There has been a recent report from the opposite side of this same ridge line within this past year report #29530. The witness was very adamant about what she observed. She had mentioned what she saw to her neighbors but was dismissed and has not talked about it since. She decided to submit her report after watching the recent \"Finding Bigfoot\" television show.",
