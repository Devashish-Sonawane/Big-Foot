            "Observed": "Last night, about 3:00 am I was awakened by a loud screaming sound from outside my house, all the windows were closed yet the sound was so loud that it woke me up.  I went to the front door and opened  it to see if I could here any better, by this time it had quieted some, but I could hear what was similar to the whoop-howls recorded on your sight coming from maybe a half mile away.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness by phone and have the following to add to this report:The sound was very loud at first. He heard it repeatedly while awake for a period of about two minutes. He heard several loud howls while still in the house and then it quieted down and resumed not as loud by the time he listened out of doors.When he went outside to check it out, other animals were reacting to the calls, including both dogs and the neighbor\u0092s bull (both of which were quiet by comparison to the calls he was hearing). After that, the sound diminished and then stopped. The call was, in his estimation, a single individual.The sound was coming from the Southwest, and he estimates that it was about a quarter to a half mile away, based on what he heard outside. When it woke him up, it was very loud and he had thought it was right outside. When he went to the front door and listened to it from the outside, he could hear from the echoes and such that it was much further away than he had originally thought. He also stated that it got quieter by the time he got outside to listen to it.The area has a lot of wood and swamp land, with some open land and not a lot of hills. There are also two rivers that converge to the Southwest, near where he thinks the call originated.He researched the sound on the Internet, listening to many different animal sounds. He says that is was almost exactly like the 1973 Whoop-Howl from Puyallup, Washington that is listed on the BFRO web site. The only differences from the sound on that recording is that it seemed closer and the whoops ended in a trailing \"E\" sound.He has heard coyotes and barred owls before and feels certain that it was neither.I am giving this report a class B rating because of this same individual's report from last February of a sighting he had about a quarter mile north of his home (Report 17900).The witness is a fifty-year-old man who has spent his entire life in the woods. I found him to be very credible and honest.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I had a very nice detailed conversation with the reporting witness. They were headed back to Arkansas from Longview Texas in two cars. Witness and his wife in one car and his friend and his wife in another. Somewhere along the way in the Big Piney Woods forest in Texas they got behind another vehicle. The three vehicles traveled alone on the 2 lane county road through the forest.Reporting witness was in the last car, riding shotgun. His friend was in the middle car and the father son duo were in the lead car. As they approached a long dark stretch of road the lead car hit his brakes and gradually started slowing down. All three cars were fairly evenly spaced and they all slowed together. The line of cars was about 125-150 feet long, including spacing between the cars. The witness was curious as to why they were stopping, but figured it was an animal, debris or car trouble and no big deal. As they slowed to about 20 MPH or so the reporting witness saw \" a creature on the left hand side of the road. It was crouched down and had it's head down looking at the road (like it wanted to cross)\". It then \"stood up and took three big steps (or awkward jumps) and easily cleared the road between the first and second cars\". The side it jumped from had a nice flat shoulder and the other side of the road had a 5-6 ft deep drainage ditch. When it hit the ditch it stopped, turned around and just looked slightly over it's shoulder towards the woods from their direction as they were still slowly moving. Witness stated that the creature \"was about eye level with his eyes\" and estimated the height of the creature to be 8.5 to 9 feet in height based on his seating height plus the drainage ditch depth. All 6 witnesses had a clear unobstructed view of the creature  for 1 to 1.5 minutes and the headlights lit it up very well.Description by witness is mostly unchanged: Reddish hair (Orangutan like) with very long arms, eyes reflecting red from headlights. Since it was looking slightly away they could not make out facial features. Instead of stopping to discuss what just happened, all three cars resumed speed and did not stop until they reached a gas station after a 30-45 minute drive. They all got out and the conversation was quite animated. Witness and his wife, and his buddy and his wife were quite certain what they saw, but the father son duo in the lead car were trying to come up with another explanation. What they ALL agreed on was it was something they had never seen before. The two couples were very forest savvy and were hunters and knew for certain what it wasn't. The father in the lead car was just bewildered. Note: the witnesses first estimate in height was 6 ft or so, and after realizing it was standing in a ditch after clearing the road, plus rethinking the event, he stated 8 ft minimum was more like it. But no matter the height, the creature was what it was. They sat on this for nearly 40 years before coming forward.",
