Based on the height of his tent, the location of the elbow in relation to a bi-pedal creature's body, and the shape of the impression, he believes that he saw an impression of the creature's elbow pressing against the tent.He was under the impression that the creature walked by their campsite and it's elbow hit the side of their tent. He discounted the possibility of a bear due to the sound of the creature's footsteps and the fact that if a bear comes into a campsite they will always look for food. They will usually rummage through coolers/garbage etc. Deer/moose will usually avoid a campsite altogether. The witness stated that the sound that the creature made as it moved away from the camp was consistent with the heavy footsteps of a large bi-pedal creature. This area has a history of activity. There are many documented reports in the BFRO database regarding vocalizations and sightings in Warren County.
