Our farm is on the border of Paulding County, GA., near the small \"town\" of Draketown (it's more of a settlement than a town).  We typically spend about one weekend out of the month at our farm where we have a nice cabin (house).  The land consists of pasture (no cattle), pines, hardwoods, swamp, and five pretty large lakes.  Whenever we are down there we go spotlighting at night to look at deer.  We don't hunt the deer on our land and usually see 50-80 deer a night just riding around and looking at them.  Being only about 1.5 hours from Atlanta this area is EXTREMELY remote and secluded.  It's all private land and not much activity occurs around there.",

This location is directly 10 miles east of Hannah Swamp and the February 2007 sighting on Hwy 101  (BFRO Report 18044).",
