            "Observed": "My husband and I were up off of highway 410, about 5 miles outside of Greenwater (on the FS road right after the fire station on the left side of the road)around the first part of June in 2008.  We had come from Tacoma and I was trying to get my husband acquainted with being in the woods at night, so we headed up to a place I liked to go occasionally to start a fire and cook some food and relax.  It was a site for what looked like an old rock quarry alongside the right hand side of the woods. I chose the spot because it was fairly open to the road and there were also a large number of campers dotted throughout the woods and along the river at the time.  It should also be noted that it was foggy.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the female witness by phone for 50 minutes and exchanged several emails. The following details can be added:Upon entering the quarry they drove along slowly near the left side. Suddenly the large human-like creature was seen a short distance in front of their vehicle. They could see the entire creature, viewing it from it's back left side as it stood hunched over, but on two legs at the bottom of the gravel slope at the left edge of the quarry. They then watched as it used all four limbs to quickly climb up the long, steep, gravel slope to the top where the forest resumed. The witness expressed that no human could climb like it did or move so incredibly fast. At the top, the creature again stood on two legs, turned it's body and seemed to look at the witnesses for a couple seconds before walking bipedal into the woods and out of sight. Diminishing light conditions of dusk combined with the thin fog made it impossible to see facial details, but they could see that the face was flat like a human and did not feature a muzzle like a bear or dog. The witness estimated the height to be around 7 feet and described the body as huge with Hulk-type shoulders, very lean, and long draping arms. The color was light gray, not white, with fur/hair length of about 3 inches and no clothing was evident. All of these features were confirmed during the second sighting in the sheriff's spotlight.The female witness could not explain why she was not frightened by the sighting and does not understand her own reaction. She did get an uncomfortable feeling of being watched as they sat by the fire. The male witness was frightened by the sighting and continued to be unsettled. After the second sighting, the witnesses quickly packed up and left at the husband's insistence. As the wife indicates in her narrative, her response was possibly due to a mental defense mechanism engaging to help her cope with what she saw. The witnesses are both members of a Western Washington Native American Tribe. The encounter has helped them learn more about and better appreciate the cultural significance of the sasquatch to their tribe. The attached photos of the rock quarry are from April 2011, almost three years after the encounter. The quarry has changed some in that time due to more material being removed for nearby forest road reconstruction, but the photos provide a solid visual reference of the encounter location. Sasquatch have often been described as freezing in place to avoid detection by blending in with their environment. It's possible that the first sighting in this report involved the creature freezing in place to use it's gray color to blend in with the gray color of the gravel and may explain why the witnesses didn't see it until they were a short distance away.The term gravel pit is used interchangeably for rock quarry in the satellite photo below.
