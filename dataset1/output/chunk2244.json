            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness was contacted by phone and seemed sincere. After a 20 minute conversation with the witness additional facts were brought up and are thus:1.  Reporting witness and partner were awakened by extremely loud howls that originated from a patch of protected greenbelt located behind their residence.2. Reporting witness is a former member of the United States Army and is a lifetime hunter. He is familiar with the Washington outdoors and the sounds that the resident wildlife make.3. He described 4 howls  with at least a one minute pause in between howls.4. The witness did listen to the BFRO sound files and definitely identified the 1978 Snohomish County whoop/howl recording as very similar to the howls that he heard that night.The witness and his wife were woken up by the powerful screams and eventually came to the conclusion that the sounds were possibly made by a Bigfoot creature. Because of the location and type of howl I believe that is very possible.",

My husband and I go to his families cabin in Wetmore which is in Schoolcraft County on the Chain of Lakes.  In June of 2006 we were standing out on the deck at around 10:30 and we both heard from across the lake back somewhere in the woods (it sounded like the area of Pine Marten Run Trail) a loud grunt/howl sound.  It sounded exactly like the calls from your website.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Their cabin is on a lake that is part of the Chain of Lakes. This chain consists of four lakes that are connected to the Big Indian River. They have heard \"talking\" on several occasions and \"whispering\" that was not english.  They stated whoever was trying to whisper was not doing a very good job at it. What they heard may be what we refer to as \"chatter\" by sasquatches.  Just two miles from their cabin is the lake where they found the track.  This small, uninhabited lake is in the center of the Hiawatha National Forest and is only accessible by four-wheel drive vehicles.  It fluctuates in depth, and depending on the time of the year, there is often a sandy shoreline.  Located next to the headwaters of the Gilpecker Creek Valley, it is a short distance from the Big Indian River system.  This system is connected to a wilderness area of several lakes, heavy forest and swamp country that is connected to the Sceney Wildlife Refuge. The Refuge is connected to a vast, wild and heavy swamp country leading all the way north to Lake Superior. This Refuge also runs south and breaks out into farm country that is a mixture of small wetlands and wooded areas leading all the way to Lake Michigan.All these areas have deer in them and plenty of wildlife.  Deer have to move to these warmer swamps where there is enough food to sustain them for the winter. Their main food source during heavy snow is cedar found in the swamp country and along rivers. Some deer migrate over 30 miles south and southwest where there is less snow and where food is more readily available.  The closer you get to Lake Michigan the less snow you have.  The Lake Superior snowfall averages 3 to 4 feet and the deer have to migrate to areas where there is food and cover for the winter. These areas are known as yarding areas where several deer will congregate. Once they are trapped in these very isolated yards they can't get out because of the deep snow which would make them very vulnerable.  The last two winters the snow has come late and left fairly early so the deer were not confined for a long period of time.  This had lead to a population increase of deer from the winters of 2006 and 2007 and there are currently a lot of young deer.These lakes are approximately 50 miles from the 2007 Michigan Expedition connected by waterways of streams, rivers and swampy wetland.
