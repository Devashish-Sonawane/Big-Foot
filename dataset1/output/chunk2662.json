            "Observed": "On Labor day weekend 1993, I went camping with two friends of mine, Brian and Steve. We went to an area that had a little lake with an un-improved campground. My parents went up there that Friday morning and we went after work as Brian and I worked at the same place. We picked up Steve on the way out there. We got to the lake at around 9pm Friday night, and after setting up our camp, we sat and talked half the night. The camp was on the north end of the lake. There was a marsh area that had very thick underbrush to the immediate west of our camp. This marsh area extended to almost the southwest of the lake. If you picture a clock, the marsh area would be from the 8'0 clock to the 12'0 clock position.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for close to 45 minutes. He was very sure of what he saw. I found him to be a very forthcoming and honest witness. I can add the following information gleaned from our conversation: The area itself was a primitive campsite area with no pavement, fire pit or facilities. It was remote and there were no other campers in the area.  He added that later his mother spoke to him about hearing \"whoops\" in the area but thought nothing of it. He played her some of the sounds from off of the BFRO website and she said they were very similar to what she'd heard. With respect to the daylight sighting, he says it's very likely the animal could hear the approach of their vehicle and their conversations, as it was only 30 yards away from where they parked. He states that the animal stood from a \"position similar to that of a baseball catcher\" and that it \"leaned to the left a bit to help push itself up\". The hair was \"medium length, matted in places, and had some mud in patches along the backside\". He saw no grey hairs but did not get the impression that it was a young animal. He saw no ears or genitals. He says the hands were \"enormous... just so huge. The fingers were huge\". He saw \"muscle movement in the shoulders and back, legs and buttocks\" and overall movement that was \"beautifully smooth and fluid, almost like gliding; and I never heard it make a sound as it moved...it was so quiet, it was really incredible that something that big could be so quiet\". It never ran or seemed fearful, but it did leave the area and disappear over a ridge in a determined manner. ",
