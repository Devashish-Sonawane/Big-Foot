            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness over the phone for an hour. He recalled his encounter in detail. The witness had the following information to add.The witness was told stories from relatives of a similar screaming animal that would come around their farm only at night during the 1950\u0092s, in the same general area. The screams of this animal would be accompanied by a strong foul odor. The animal would leave signs of tree bark being stripped from surrounding trees and scrape marks which were well above six feet in height. The animal would also enter the barn to eat oats stored for horses. The witness was also told by his relatives that the animal would urinate in certain spots, killing the surrounding vegetation and emitting a strong odor for days.The witness\u0092s mother once told him that when she was a teen on horseback with her sister they had an encounter from a distance, with what they thought was a man in a black suit waving his arms frantically. This took place in the middle of the summer. The witness\u0092s mother always thought it strange that there would be a man in a suit out in the woods during the hottest time of the year. The horses became extremely agitated and the girls left out of fright.The witness was apprehensive to file this report at first because he was not sure what he had heard that night. It was only after reading other reports of screams in the same area of New Jersey on the BFRO web site, coupled with the stories of his relatives that the witness felt comfortable sharing his experience.

            "Observed": "In the summer of 1970 being young and still interested in kissing the girls I had a unique experience. We were riding around in my 1962 chevy convertible with the top down. On the edge of town there was a park, Stone State Park, consisting of 1132 acres surrounded by farms and overlooking the big Sioux River, dividing Iowa and South Dakota. We decided to go to lookout point at the park and park for a while. It was a beautiful summer night and just light enough to see in the dark. When we got there the girl I was with and I decided to take a blanket and place it on a flat spot about 20 or 30 feet from the edge of the parking lot overlooking the river. To one side of where we placed the blanket there were trees and bushes. The other couple were in the back seat of the car with the top down. We had perhaps been there for no more that 15 minutes or so and I was on the blanket kissing when all of a sudden there was something in the bushes beside us screaming down at us at the top of her lungs. The volume was mind blowing. As we were running the scream seemed to still be directed toward us. I didn\u0092t even open the door of the car, I just jumped in and I think the girl with did the same. Although we were only kissing, almost right away and for about 35 years, I believed it had to do with babies. For all that time I was thinking she screamed at us because it was the wrong time of year for us to even think about such a thing, and thus got screamed at. Untill now. Recently captiankillmore put a link to sightings on the forum. When I went and read it, I think I may have found the answer to my thinking babies all these many years. At the time and for about 35 years it was just a sixth sense feeling. Her scream as it went on sounded just like a human women, except louder with unbelievable volume.",

            "Also Noticed": "We were laying on the blanket not making any sound or movement. I believe she had heard the car pull up and was going to check it out from a safe distance. As in august 1974 there was a young one 31/2 ft. tall in the garden near there and a 7ft. one also observed near there. A 7ft fullgrown bf would most likely be female. What I heard sounded exactly like a women. I believe now when she was sneaking up to check out the people in the car she had the much smaller young one with her. She didn\u0092t know I was laying by the bushes until she was pretty much right on top of me. She Freaked Out.  Its just what I now believe happened. Could I be wrong? Possibly, But that sixth sense feeling about it being about babies, has been with me for around 35 years now. Maybe  I\u0092m wrong, maybe I\u0092m not.  If any of the admin wish to im me I will give them the phone number to cantact the guy that was in the backseat of the car.",
