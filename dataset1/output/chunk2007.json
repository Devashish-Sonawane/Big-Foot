            "Observed": "The first incident for me happened in late winter 2003 around the end of February or early March. I had an exchange student living with me and my family and she had a snow day so we headed outside that day. Since she rarely gets to see snow I thought it would be a treat to walk around and play in the snow. I told her we would take a short walk into the pine grove behind us even though it is not our land, I figured it wouldn't hurt for her to take some pictures of the trees. As we were walking I was struck at the fact that I couldn't find her any animal tracks. I just figured it was new snow and the tracks had been covered up. As we walked I was really surprised how quiet it was. Again thinking the new snow had something to do with it. There are a lot of crows in the woods but that day they made no sound. As we walked we did come along some tracks. I asked her what did she think made those knowing what I was thinking; I wanted to hear what she had to say first. She said it looked exactly like some one was walking around barefoot. She asked me what kind of animal has footprints like a human. I thought about bear but have studied bear print pictures and these were very long and narrow. The fact that there were only two also eliminated the bear. There was no overlapping of prints. The space between them was really far as well. I am not tall but I didn't even come close to stretching my stride that far. We followed the footprints and they had stopped and looked as if they squatted down. Just the toes were showing which consisted of the five toes. We looked up and the tracks stopped just inside the woods looking towards the back of my husband\u0092s shop. That kind of freaked us both out. The footprints started to turn and walk up the fence post in the direction they had come. My exchange student wanted to follow but I said no way. She even had a camera with her and we didn\u0092t even think to get a picture.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "An on-site investigation was conducted because the witness reported the distinctive growl had returned to the property.  While looking along a fence row that had berries and fruit trees, a possible footprint was found , it had a distinctive heel, possible toe imprints and a uniform, flat pad with no shoe tread or heel marks.  It measured 11 inches by  five inches with a depth of 1 inch.  It had rained  slightly the previous evening and part of the day before we arrived.  The print was fresh, it was likely created within the past two days because of the dry conditions  Ohio has been experiencing.  The location was approximate to where the witness stated she had heard the growl while spotlighting the fence row.Two separate footprint finds occurred in relation to the sighting, once was in snow at the back of the property and the others were in bare soft ground in an adjoining woodlot.  We were able to see pictures they had taken of the latter print, and it was of very good quality, much better than average in my opinion.  The actual sighting was exceptionally brief, just long enough for the witness to take a look and retreat back to the house.  She had stepped off the porch and was within 10 feet of the door.  What she spotted was crouching, sitting back on its heels, motionless and looking away in profile.  It was at the corner of the house about 15 feet away and was illuminated by two exterior fixtures located on each side of the door.  While no other family members had a sighting, they all reported an exceptionally strong and lingering scent of  what they described as bad body odor when they rushed back outside that night.In talking with the family members there are additional sightings from a son and his friends.  I am making arrangements to talk with him as he is currently in the military.The property is in the southern range of a series of woodlots that stretch many miles north to another area where two Class A sightings were investigated.  It is also within a few miles of the headwaters of two drainages, the Ohio River and Lake Erie.  There is a mix of land uses, farming, woodlots and individual rural residences.  The terrain is rolling with rivers, ponds and small swamp areas as water sources.  The  property itself held berries, fruit and nut trees in a wide variety.  The witness mentioned that the small pear grove had been \u0093stripped\u0094 on more than one occasion.For many reasons I found the witness and her family to be credible concerning what they had seen, heard and smelled.  Because of the fleeting look the witness had I am going classify this report as a Class B.  The combination of the footprint finds, the vocalizations and a pungent odor lead me to think the witness did see a Bigfoot, but the quick look she had did not yield enough of a description for this Investigator to be certain without any doubt.",
