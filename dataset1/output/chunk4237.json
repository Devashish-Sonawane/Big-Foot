            "Media Issue": "The same or a similar looking animal was seen in Silver Lake township, about two weeks since, by a boy some 16 years old. We had the story from the father of the boy and afterward from the boy himself. The boy was sent to work in the backwoods near the New York state line. He took with him a gun and was told by his father to shoot at anything he might see except persons or cattle. After working awhile he heard some person, his little brother he supposed, coming toward him whistling quite merrily. He said it looked like a human being, covered with black hair, about the size of his brother who was six or seven years old. His gun was somewhere a little distance off and he was very much frightened.  However, he got his gun and shot at the animal, but trembled so that he could not hold it still. The strange animal, just as his gun went off, stepped behind a tree and then went off, whistling as before. The father said the boy came home very much frightened.... ",
