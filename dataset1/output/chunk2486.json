            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with Charlie, who was initially nervous when discussing the incidents. The first night, which was overcast and damp, began as any overnight camping trip would, with dinner and making plans for the next day. After sunset they heard very distinct knocks coming from the north, east and west.  The knocks, which were sporadic, went on for nearly ninety minutes.  Eventually Charlie and his camping buddy would knock and then would hear response knocks, with the loudest responses coming from the east. As they hunkered down for the night they heard a very distinct low voiced whoop. And about 1 a.m. they were awakened when something very large slowly walked by their campsite.The next night, which was perfectly clear and chilly, again began with the same knocking patterns. Charlie and his friend knocked back. This time whatever was making the knocks to the east began to move closer.  His friend became uncomfortable with the scene, and they made their way back to the campsite and sat near their fire.  From the woods opposite them, which was the towards the east, they clearly saw a pair of red eyes about six feet off the ground. They do not believe the eyes were reflecting the amber color of the fire, and at one point Charlie saw them blink. There are no cell phone towers, out buildings, roads of any kind, or other campers in the direction of the eyes. At first neither one said anything about the eyes. Charlie and his friend decided to go into the woods to the west, maybe about forty feet, and do a couple of knocks.  As they moved in, a tremendous deep grunt was heard very close by. Charlie's friend had enough, and in Charlie's words his friend was \"horrified\" and went straight back into camp, packed up his gear, and they left. It was on the way home as they began to recount what just happened that they both said that they saw the red eyes staring at them.The campground is located on the western end of the Echo Trail, a remote country road that traverses through the heart of the western Superior National Forest. It is situated on the southern shore of Lake Jeanette and provides scenic views of the lake. The terrain is covered with a granite rock outcropping and a mix of pine and spruce trees. This area was once the site of a Civilian Conservation Corps camp which operated in the 1930s.",

The cabin was just a simple one room building with a window on either side and a cabinet to store your belongings.  There were two army style cots on either side of the cabin, each near a window.  It was very rustic.  The door didn't even have a lock on it, it was just a wooden latch that went through a slot on the door frame.",
