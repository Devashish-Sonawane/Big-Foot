I use to walk through the woods with my rifle just to feel safe. There was an old couple that had a farm across from the woods. I got to know them pretty well . I would go there for coffee. The old man and his wife would tell me stories about this Bigfoot. The farmer said that  the bigfoot comes into his garden and take his crops. \"I said Oh really\", I did not beleave him, and that was that. Until one night I was home alone with my puppy dog.We were sitting on the pourch, and you couldn't see three feet in front of you. I heard this noise brakeing through the brush. I got so scared I ran into the house, grabed my rifle and stood behind the front door,I could hardly move. Then I heard whatever it was, go around the back of the house.It tryed to get into the door. I ran out the front door into the orange groves, I kept on running. My foot got caught on a root of a tree and I fell. I rolled into the swamp, and lost my rifel.",

I asked her if she smelled anything during the encounter and she said...\"Yes, something smelling really bad\".She was the only witness.  She has never seen or heard it before or after this had happened. I asked her what year her encounter happened and she said around 1980.This happened about one (1) year before another encounter in 1981 in Seminole Co. not too far from this encounter. You can read about that enounter in the state of FL reports.She told me about the farmer that has seen this creature many times but she has since moved to NY and doesn't know if the farming couple is still there. She also told me of others that have been able to get castings of footprints in this area. ",
