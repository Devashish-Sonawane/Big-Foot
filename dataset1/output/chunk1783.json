            "Observed": "it was june of 2008 i was walking from my uncles house back to a farm that was about a half mile away on university dr in new philadelphia ohio, tuscarawas co. when i was walking towards the farm i heard what sounded like coyotes at first then it got real quiet then i heard a very strange sound it was not your usual animal sounds it was a high pitched howl/growl. shortly after that there was a strange smell of musty earth then i saw it (bigfoot) come walking out of the corn field.i would have to say it was about 7 to 8 ft tall long shaggy hair it looked like a over sized man with hair. i was walking on the road in front of it how i seen it was i heard the corn rustle as it stepped out of the corn field an i looked back to see what made the noise i started walking faster and when i got to the farm driveway my mom was there to pick me up and when she turned the head lights on the thing stopped following me stood there for a second then turned an moved quickly back into the cornfield it also made that weird noise again witch my mom also heard.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness in a telephone interview and the following information can be included.  After the high pitched howl subsided, she heard something very large moving through the cornfield.  The witness described that what stepped out of the corn appeared to be an overgrown man that was very hairy.  She recalled there was enough moonlight to see a head, shoulders and very big arms.  The witness did not want to alarm her young son so she diverted her attention from the creature to quickly walking her son along the road to the point where she was to meet her mother.  Along her route, the witness would look back over her shoulder only to observe the creature following her while keeping its distance at the same time.  The witness said that every time she would look back, the creature would move toward the corn field as if to be ready to duck back into the field.  This behavior continued until she got to the point where her mom was waiting.  As her mom started the car and turned on the headlights, the witness heard the creature make a grunt as though it was very disgruntled and she heard it move back into the corn field.  As she was getting into the car, she heard the high pitched howl again which her mother also heard.  The witness was shaken by her encounter.  Her main focus was on getting her son to the car.  Later, when the witness was able to discuss what occurred with her mother, her mom advised her that she remembered that howl from when she was younger.  I found the witness to be sincere and credible in recounting her encounter.  According to the witness, her son remembers the incident but doesn't recall many details.  The area of her encounter is very rural with small family farms which contain abundant resources.  In season, corn would be plentiful and a viable deer population all year round.  ",
