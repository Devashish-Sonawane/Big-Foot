There is no access to the cabin besides these stairs, and they must be used to get to the deck at the back of the cabin.--The animal had to bend over to look inside the window.  --Its face was covered in hair and was flat, including the nose.  The face appeared weathered.--Its arms hung by its side, but that is all he could see as he could only see the abdomen and above of the animal.--The head was slightly pointed toward the back of the head.--The animal appeared to be looking for something in the cabin itself.--The witness did not tell anyone because the owners of the cabin were older and he didn\u0092t want to scare them.--The witness has not been back to the cabin since.",
