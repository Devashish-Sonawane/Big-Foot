            "Observed": "My husband and I live in Sautee, Ga., just outside of Helen. My husband can't sleep very well at night and as such he is up at all hours. For about the last three weeks he has heard strange sounds late at night. He has got me up several times to listen. Whatever we are hearing is not anything we have heard before. All of the dogs go crazy and whatever it is seems to move very quickly, attracting the dogs as it goes. It is very loud and it more of a howl or scream; it does not sound like a bobcat or bear or anything else we have heard since living in Northeast Ga. We have lived in this area for nine years and my husband has hunted all his life and is used to sounds in the night, just not this one. When he woke me up to hear this we jokingly said \"maybe it's a bigfoot\". I got curious as to whether or not there had been any sightning in our area and found this website. After reading reports from this area I thought that maybe we had heard something out of the ordinary, hence the report.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken with the submitter of the report and her husband many times since this report was received. Since her initial report, she and her husband have experienced other strange incidents that are consistent with purported sasquatch behaviors. This is report is one of many cold-weather reports that we receive annually from the Sautee-Nacoochee Valley. Many other residents have heard similar vocalizations in the dead of night in this valley system. I personally heard a series of calls emanating from a heavily forested area that sounded identical to the BFRO's \"Ohio Howl\" recording in the same valley in late October of 2000, at about 2:00 AM. Interestingly, the witnesses in this case have stressed to me that the \"Ohio Howl\" recording is the most similar recording of a purported sasquatch vocalization to what they heard. After spending some time with the witnesses, listening to them describe and imitate the long, sustained calls that they heard, and visiting their home, I suspect that they did indeed hear a sasquatch vocalizing over the Sautee-Nacoochee Valley for several nights. This is an on-going case, as these witnesses are now very vigilant, and have become much more educated than most about this subject.  ",
