            "Follow-Up Report": "I became aware of this case when the reporting party\u0092s voice mail was posted on the BFRO Investigator\u0092s Facebook Page, I volunteered to return the call.I made telephone contact with Ron on the evening of 18 November 2018,  one week after the incident occurred.  Ron is a middle school math teacher and avid fly fisherman.  He described himself as the type of guy who doesn\u0092t believe in things like ghosts or bigfoot.  He said, \u0093I\u0092m skeptical of things I can\u0092t see or touch.\u0094  The incident that happened near Green Lake, however, has forced him to reassess his skepticism.  His comments to me are synopsized below\u0085\u0093My girlfriend and I had a three-day weekend so we decided to do some fly fishing up at Green Lake. I live in southern California, so it is a 7-hour drive for us to reach South Lake in the Inyo National Forest, then we hiked about three miles up to Green Lake.  I\u0092ve been to Green Lake many times in the past.  The elevation at South Lake is about 9000 feet and the trail to Green Lake takes you up past 11000 feet, so it\u0092s pretty steep in places and there are a lot of switchbacks on the trail.\u0093We hiked up to Green Lake only to find it was totally frozen over.  We decided to hike back down towards another lake in the area.  At one point in our hike we stopped to rest and eat some snacks. While we were there I had a very eerie feeling.  It caused me to feel cold and shaky and nervous.  As we were sitting there, we suddenly heard a noise of something flying through the air.  I looked up and saw a huge rock, which probably weighed at least 45 pounds, coming from above us.  The rock landed on the trail about 25 yards away from us.  It wasn\u0092t rolling down the hillside.  It\u0092s trajectory indicated to me it had been thrown down the hillside.\u0093At about that same instant we heard a very distinct animal-like grunting noise, but it was far louder than any animal grunt I\u0092ve ever heard.  We also detected a really foul smell.  I particularly remember the foul smell because one moment we were breathing really fresh mountain air and the next moment there was this awful smell.\u0093About that time, we could hear heavy footsteps coming down the hillside towards us.  The terrain in this area is steep with many tall pine trees.  We couldn\u0092t see very far above us, but we could hear something was coming towards us.\u0093I\u0092ve encountered many bears in that area in the past and I immediately grew concerned a bear was approaching us.  I yelled something like, \u0093It\u0092s a (expletive) bear!\u0094  The whole thing was so frightening and unexpected that we both started running!  We left my girlfriend\u0092s jacket, my sunglasses, and our food there and just started running down the switchbacked trail.  (The jacket and sunglasses each cost over $100.  We never went back to get them.)\u0093As we kept running down the switchbacks we could hear the heavy footsteps following us.  Whatever it was, it didn\u0092t stay on the trail and follow the switchbacks like we did.  Instead, it cut straight down the hillside, and its movements were loud enough for us to hear it.  We ran for about five minutes before realizing the thing was no longer following us.  We went back to the trailhead, got in our car, and left.\u0093This was the scariest thing I\u0092ve ever experienced in my life.  I\u0092m confused and puzzled by the whole thing.  I\u0092m not the kind of guy who believes in things like ghosts or bigfoots.  But, I can\u0092t explain what happened to us.  That\u0092s why I reached out to you guys (the BFRO).\u0094In my follow-up questions, I asked Ron about the rock he saw flying through the air.  He said he guessed it was at least 45 pounds. He felt it was definitely too big for a human to have thrown.  It wasn\u0092t smooth and round, but was more angular with sharp edges, which he assumes is why he heard it flying through the air before he actually saw it.  Ron also stated that in hindsight, although he initially was afraid they were being stalked by a bear, he felt the whole thing was unlike any normal bear behavior he\u0092s ever experienced.  He now believes it was not a bear. During my conversation, I found Ron\u0092s story to be believable and compelling.  I got the impression this is a person with an analytical mind-set.  He experienced something unusual and now wants to understand the why and how of what happened.  He didn\u0092t seem to be looking for attention, but wanted information, instead.I explained to Ron that sasquatches will sometimes engage in territorial displays such as rock throwing, tree shaking, or angry vocalizations.  Bluff charges have also been reported in which sasquatches seem to be intent on chasing people away from an area.  Based on Ron\u0092s description of the moving noises he heard, I suspect he and his girlfriend were on the receiving end of a bluff charge.  After seeing a rock thrown in their direction, they heard a loud grunting noise, smelled a foul odor, and heard heavy footsteps coming their way.  I find it interesting that as they ran down the switchbacks, the maker of all this commotion ran straight down the hill side, cutting across the switchbacks.  This is what makes me believe this was a bluff charge, rather than some type of predatory behavior.  If a sasquatch or any other large animal was running straight downhill it would have easily caught up to the humans who were sticking to the switchbacked trail.  Since it never did catch up to Ron and his girlfriend, I can only assume the suspected sasquatch was merely trying to scare them away rather than wanting to actually catch them.This incident has caused Ron to give more thought to the sasquatch mystery.  I suggested to him one of the best ways to learn more about sasquatches was to attend a BFRO expedition.  I wouldn\u0092t be surprised if he signs up for one of the 2019 expeditions.",

            "Observed": "We live in Michigan near a national forest. One evening my 2 18 year old daughters and I took my pick up down a two track looking for rocks for our fire pit we were building. It was light out with a light rain. We were coming up over a ridge on the trail and when we were starting down a huge bigfoot ran across the trail in front of us. We all saw it well. It was covered in long black hair with a patch of white hair along its back near its shoulder. Its was running with amazing speed in a forward leaning position and its arms seemed to almost touch the ground as it ran we figured it to be approximately 9 foot tall. We could clearly see legs arms hands head muscle definition throughout its body even with long hair. The hair on its back and body was longer than the hair on its head and arms. We didnt get to see its face tho.but the strangest part of this was that it was running with a gray colored wolf that I've seen multiple times before. It really appeared that they were together..The wolf was at full stride about 15 feet behind it .Once it cleared the track it went up the hill on the other side with an amazing speed. It seemed to pull away from the wolf at the last little bit we watched it. We tried to drive to where they last were to try and see them again but they were gone. That wolf was ran very close to me on my 4 wheeler and I can tell you he is no little puppy. He leaves an almost 5 1/2 inch track and the bigfoot dwarfed the wolf. The next day I went back to look for prints but the 14 hours of heavy rain over night ruined and prints there might have been. We have found several other 4 toed very large prints in the area. A local bf researcher came out to investigate the area and was impressed with what is called tree structures. There was are a couple found like a teepee style and one is very large but the trees are upside down. Weird! I have pictures of the things we have found and are happy to share all my evidence we have found to help others know these things are real and they exist here in Michigan.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness has had several encounters, I will document each encounter in separate statements, in an attempt to avoid confusion.First Encounter: The first area is northwest of Higgins Lake  in Roscommon county, there are few actual roads within this area, most \"roads\" are two-tracks used by those vacationing in the area for fun or by hunters during a seasonal hunting period, those off road trails form a checkerboard pattern throughout this area. This checkerboard consists of open farmland, blocks of woods, patches of scrub brush dotting the area and the occasional open area that has a pumpjack. There are small creeks, a few 1 acre lakes, some patches of swamp and a few seasonal wetlands. Though US-127 is nearby, once you get a few hundred yards into the area, the only indications of civilization is the two-track trails that outline the checkboard and the occasional pumpjack. Glaciers shaped the area. A large portion of the area is the so-called Grayling outwash plain, which consists of broad outwash plain including sandy ice-disintegration ridges; jack pine barrens, some white pine-red pine forest, and northern hardwood forest. Large lakes were created by glacial action. There are a varied assortment of wildlife; ex: (geese, ducks, deer, squirrels, raccoons, etc.), along with farm crops ex:(soybean, corn, fruit, etc.) The area the witness had one of his encounters is wooded with ash, birch and pines; while the terrain is mostly rolling hills, with wetlands and the occasional kettle dotting the landscape, on one of the two-tracks previously noted that form the checkboard pattern. There are no major power corridors located nearby, but north of the encounter is what appears to be the outlines of a former creek/stream/river. The witness explained to me that he was in his pickup with his daughters looking for stones for a fire ring they were working on. They were heading east on the two-track when they crested a hill in front of them, when something ran in front of their vehicle heading south. The witness stated it was covered in hair that appeared black in color, with what appears to be a white or lighter color patch between its shoulder blades. The creature could have possibly been on all fours, because the witness noticed that it was leaning forward and that its arms almost reached the ground, but it was coming up an incline, crossed the road and up another incline, so the arms may have been stretched out to grab a hold of anything in front of its travel path (trees, earth, stumps, etc.)  The witness also noted that directly behind the creature was a large wolf that appeared to be keeping pace with the creature and that he felt the wolf wasn't chasing the creature, but was running with it. The witness stated that he has seen a wolf in that area of the woods on more than one occasions= and that the one behind the creature looked very much the same as the previous one which had left a paw print around 5-1/2\". The witness estimated that if the creature stood up, it would be around 9' tall, he also noted that the hair on the back and body appeared longer than the hair on its head and arms.My initial contact with the witness was at his residence, he invited us in and we began discussing the area, his experience and approximately where it was located. He and one of his daughters hopped in his truck and we followed him to the area of the first experience. It took some time to get there, the two-tracks are not easily traversed by mere cars, 4-wheel drive was required that day. Along the way, we took numerous photos of interesting tree structures. The first spot he took us to was a location that he and the family routinely camp at, a 20' x 40' indent into the brush off one of the two-tracks. He showed us a fairly large stick structure nearby, which appeared to be at least 15' tall, there is also a smaller (mini-me) versions right next to it, and we also noticed that there are a lot of arches in the surrounding woods. Now they could be from snow load, or not; I am just noting that there are dozens and dozens of them around in the woods. We also found a ORV trail that had branches, limbs and a tree leaning over it blocking access down it, not saying its anything but interesting. We also encountered something that the witness drove past, but I found very interesting, so I stopped to look at it and take some pictures.================================================================================================================================================ What I found was part of a tree suspended horizontal, up a ways in a tree, held up by these branches. Now, I know what some may say, \"Ok, so what..\", but if you notice the tree is bigger than the branches holding it, so if it fell the weight & size should have broken those limbs, also if you look at the last picture, you see that it was cut by a chain saw. Now, my question is simple, \"What type of individual would cut a tree down, only to hoist it back up into the air, setting it on a few tree limbs?\"================================================================================================================================================2nd Encounter: The second area is on the western side of \"Dead Stream Swamp\", which was designated as a National Natural Landmark in 1976 and is part of the Au Sable State Forest. The 11,680 acre parcel according to Michigan DNR; \"\u0085is an exceptionally large example (one of the largest in the United States) of a northern white cedar swamp, considered to be the climax in bog forest development. Large white cedar swamps are disappearing, partially due to the demand for this timber product. Besides swamp forest, the Landmark contains approximately 800 acres of deciduous upland forest; shrubs and sedges bordering the lower reaches of Dead Stream; and the 60-acre Bear Lake, a bog pond bordered by an expansive sphagnum-heath mat.\" There are a varied assortment of wildlife; ex: (geese, ducks, deer, squirrels, raccoons, etc.), along with farm crops ex:(soybean, corn, fruit, etc.) The other encounter occurred on the boarder of a swamp, with trees to the north and  west and scrub/ bushes lining the two-track that lead to the clearing. There are several trails to the north & northeast of the clearing that go off into the woods or into the swamp.  The witnesses second encounter occurred south of Higgins Lake, near an area that is called \"Dead Stream Swamp\". There was a two-track that went from the main road back towards and skirting the western edge of the swamp ending at a clearing that opened up to around a 150' in diameter. The witness stated that it was him, family and friends that were gathering for a party. There was a fire going and everyone was laughing, sitting around in chairs or at the picnic table that the witness brought. As the evening progressed, they started noticing sounds coming from the woods surrounding the clearing, breaking branches, vocalizations and what sounded like a tree crashing to the ground. They eventually saw a silhouette moving in the woods, west of the clearing and that prompted everyone to decide to leave. The witness, friends and family proceeded down the two-track towards the main road and came across a tree laying across their path. Several of the party-goers grabbed chainsaws, cut the tree up to move it, allowing everyone to eventually leave. The picnic table is still in the clearing, the witness currently has no intentions on retrieving it. The second experience was brought up by the witness at the tail end of the discussion we were having about his first encounter, afterwards he offered to take us to the spot, but wanted us to understand that when it starts getting dark, he wanted out of that area. Upon arrival, I noticed that the turn off he took was an easy one to miss if you're driving down the road & were not familiar with the area, but once on the two-track after about 10-20 feet, you lose sight of the road of the main road. The dirt path wound back and  forth for several hundred yards, before coming out into the clearing with the swamp to the right, woods to the front & left. Upon exiting the vehicles, we walked around the clearing as the witness proceeded to explain the circumstances of the night. He pointed the directions out of the vocalizations, he showed us where they saw the silhouette of the creature walking in the woods (it was late day, and with the sun behind the trees, everything looked like a silhouette in that direction.) We walked into the woods on the northside of the clearing and found numerous trails leading northwards, to the east and also to the west. After searching the area, we (the witness and  I) decided to follow one of the trails to the east where we encountered the swamp, with the trail continuing into it.The stick structure is compelling along with its mini-me version, the many, many arches that can be seen throughout the woods makes you stop and wonder whether that many can be attributed to natural causes and then finding a tree cut near its base and suspended some 15' above ground by limbs that are smaller in diameter than the tree itself. As for the witness and his daughter, I found them to be credible in their statements. I do believe that they had an encounter with something that they believe was a sasquatch being followed by a wolf.   There are 14 reports within a 30 mile radius of this report.This witness recently shared his encounters in person at the August 2018 UPBSRO Townhall Meeting. ",
