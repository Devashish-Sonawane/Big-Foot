            "Follow-Up Report": "I reviewed this account with the submitter in a telephone interview several days after his submission and the day after returning from the area myself, during which time I examined the exact area he described but found nothing to note. I believe him to be a competent and experienced natural observer and outdoorsman and found his re-telling of his experience to be yet-urgent, compelling and persuasive. He seems to be another person prompted to a serious and on-going interest in this subject due to his own unusual observations and the personal persuasion resulting from the experience.As described, the campsite sits just east of and adjacent to the river. A steep bank drops about 75-100' to the river and an equally steep slope on the opposite side rises far higher and is heavily wooded. His campsite is fully exposed and visible to the much higher vantage point and heavy cover of the opposite mountainside. This location is immediately north of \"Roaring Gulch\".His direct and detailed account of his observations can be supplemented with some further descriptions that he provided in our discussion. -He variously described the sound as \"an ungodly loud noise, scream, shriek, screech, yell and roar with a depth to it all rolled into one\".-The sound was of one consistent pitch and lasted approximately 5-7 seconds in duration.-There was a \"volume, tone and quality\" of the sound unlike anything else.-It was \"definitely not an elk, not a cougar, not a bobcat, and nothing I've ever heard before in my life\". -He described \"going through the inventory of animals\" and concluding that it must have been a sasquatch because \"what else would it be?\"-The sound had an \"uneasy, unsettling and disturbing\" effect on him which he considered \"not necessarily hostile, but territorial or aggressive\" and which he interpreted as \"I'm here, this is my area, you're the intruder\".-Despite having a gun with him, the sound was simply so overwhelming that he \"did not want to deal with this\", threw his cooler in his vehicle and immediately left the area, abandoning his tent and other camping equipment until his return the following morning.The witness is personally convinced that he actually heard a sasquatch and, especially given the particular area and its history of many unusual sightings and other observations by others and myself, I think it is entirely possible that he is correct.David Petti",
