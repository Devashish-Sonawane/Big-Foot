            "Observed": "I was Deer hunting in Freedom Hills Management Area around coon dog cemetery. I entered the woods before daylight and walked down the access road next to a pine forest. I came to the back of some pines where they turned into heavy hardwoods. I sat down at the bottom of a tree and waited for daylight. During my way up, behind me on top of the ridge I heard a series of grunting and heavy movement through the woods walking down the ridge behind and down the ridge it went. Once daylight came I walked up to where I first heard the grunting and movement. As I got to the area I found bedding and hair. The hair I found I kept a sample and it wasn't wild hog or bear nor mountain lion. This whole incident scared me and made me very uneasy. Later that night we heard wood knocks and a tree pushed down.",

The following can be added to his original report:The encounter happened about 90 minutes after daylight.Screams 30 seconds apart before daylight were heard 2 weeks earlier.Heavy breathing could be heard as it walked down hill and the witness felt like it was trying to run him off.The bedding was in heavy undergrowth, approximately 7\u0092 X 3.5\u0092 in size, and hard to get to.The hair found was 4\u0094-5\u0094 long and dark brown/black with a red tint at the tip, and according to one of our hair experts, resembles raccoon hair.",
