            "Observed": "I have worked as a wilderness guide for about eight years, many of which where spent in Katmai National Park and the Yukon delta. So it's fair to say I know what lives in the woods, and the behavior of the woods. I will make my story brief. My experience happened in Washington state, mid summer back in 2003. A close friend and myself decided to go shoot some ground fowl in the Indianola area of Wa. After entering a clearing some 1000ft open, we stopped to smoke a cig. I must note the air was still and damp, and I could smell death of a creature close by.  Some time during the smoke I had movement in the corner of my eye. An animal stood 400 or so ft away from me. I know what a bear looks like, I worked as a Brooks River guide. It was not a bear. It was not a person. I'm 6ft 4. It was much much larger and beefier than me. It was not someone messing around. I was armed. But I can say that animal had a stride not matched in North America. It did walk some 200ft from the left to right in my vision. I was not going to shoot it. I wanted nothing to do with it. Needless to say we exited back to the truck back to back. I have not spoke of this due to the fact it would taint my career as a wilderness guide. But note I have nothing to gain or loose, but that animal I saw was your Bigfoot.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Both the witness and and his hunting friend were out to hunt fowl in Indianola and noticed movement to their left. It was noticed that the subject stood from what seemed like its knuckles as it rose quicker than that of a subject in a full squat. The witness noticed that it had an earth tone to its hair and that it had highly developed shoulder and chest muscles. It appeared to the witness that the individual viewed was roughly seven and a half feet tall and 350-400 lbs. When the subject stood it walked to the right of the witness' field of vision and was watched for 20 seconds while it exited their field of view.This witness was shook up enough about this incident to insist that we should not go looking for them.
