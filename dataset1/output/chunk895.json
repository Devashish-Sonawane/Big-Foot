            "Observed": "It was about 1:00 am on 10/21/06 when I was camping in the Palo Duro Canyon State Park for the Palo Duro Canyon trail run the following morning. I had gotten up from my sleep and was walking down to the public restroom when I heard something rustling in the trees off to the right of the road. I turned my flashlight towards the noise and was startled to see a very large chewbacca-like thing scream like it was startled and then it turned into the trees and quickly vanished. I had stopped stiff in my tracks and was scared to death. Not only had I never heard a sound like that before, but I had never seen anything like that. It was a darkish gray-brown color with hair all over its body, deep set eyes, about 7-8 feet tall, slender with long arms, and it moved very quickly. I heard someone in a camp site nearby asking what that noise was, but I just went back to my tent and got inside. I could not sleep the rest of the night. In the morning when I made it to the run, I talked to 3 other people that said they saw and/or heard the same thing. I'm going back this year, but I hope I don't see the bigfoot again.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "These details can be added after communicating with the witness: The witness was walking on a small road to the public restrooms around 1AM when he heard a rustling sound. He quickly shined his flashlight in the direction of the sound and heard what he described as a \"sound scarier than anything I've ever heard\". It sounded like a deep, full gasp. He could tell by the sound and the creature's movement and expression that he had startled it. It instantly moved into the trees and vanished. He reported the creature was 30 to 40 feet away from him. It was too dark to see much in the way of detail but the eyes looked dark and deep-set. Its entire body, including its chest and face, was covered with darkish gray hair. He said it looked similar to \"Chewbacca\". He reported that its hair was like animal hair and not fur. He noted that the arms were much longer than a man's and extended almost to its knees. He noticed that its head was much larger than a human being. He estimates the shoulder width to be broad - approximately 30 to 36 inches; and its weight a lean 300 lbs. There was no odor associated with his sighting.What he saw paralyzed him with fear. He immediately abandoned the trip to the restroom. He was so scared he chose instead to relieve himself behind his tent. Once back inside his tent he listened intently and heard coyotes on and off during the early morning hours, but heard no other sounds. He admitted he was sleepless for the rest of the night.  He looked for tracks the next day and spoke with three other people, one of which described seeing a Bigfoot creature moving quickly through the area, trying to hide or run away.He reiterated that what he saw and heard was incredibly frightening because he had never seen anything like that in his life, and he hoped he wouldn't see it again. He said it was like, \"seeing a monster\".",
