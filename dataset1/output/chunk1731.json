            "Observed": "It was in the middle of the night and I took my three kids camping.  I was awoken by a strange noise. The noises sounded like a angry female with a smoker's voice scream in short bursts.  Probably 5 to 10 second bursts every 10 to 20 seconds.  The camping area where we were was near Lake Knoll Arizona.  You can check out my video on youtube of the campsite. Just google Lake Knoll camping.  It should be the first video.  I did not sleep the rest of the night.  I heard other noises later that night.  It sounded like multiple animals fighting but it was more animal sounding....maybe wild bores or something. I asked some of my hunter friends and they could not explain the first sound that I heard.  Other than those noises, there was not a sound to be heard.  It was dead quiet.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the reporting party by phone, he advised that although it has been nearly two years since it occurred, he remembers every detail as if it was yesterday.  He described the screams he heard as very loud, but distant, and that he did not think that they were directed specifically at his camp.  I played some audio recordings for him over the phone, and he advised that one of the recordings sounded very similar to what he heard.  He described the later sounds he heard as \u0093sounding like boars fighting.\u0094  When asked why he decided to file the report when he did, he advised that he had been in contact with an acquaintance who had heard the same type of vocalizations during an earlier camping trip to the same general location, and that he had watched the Arizona episode of the Finding Bigfoot TV show, which also discussed activity in this area. This general area has a long history of Bigfoot activity, and there are several published reports from within a ten-mile radius.  It is one of this investigator\u0092s ongoing research locations, and I have been involved in a number of research trips to this general area, both solo and with small groups, both daytime and after dark, and have heard wood knocks and vocalizations myself.This is kind of an interesting area, it is a plateau that is carved up by an extensive system of deep, rugged canyons, and most of the roads are up on the ridge tops.  The reporting party appears very sincere and credible, and there was no reason to believe that he was being anything but open and truthful about what he experienced.This is the youtube video that he refers to, there are no recordings or sasquatches in this video, its just a nice family video that shows the campsite:",

            "Observed": "About 1/2 hour before sunup two of us were elk hunting in James Canyon Fairview, Utah.  We heard a scream from across the canyon which repeated every few seconds for 5 or 6 episodes.  It shook the forest.  I have spent my whole life in the woods all over the West and know there is no animal in America that sounds that loud and piercing.  10 years later it dawned on me what we had been privileged to hear -my hunting buddy agrees and we heard a similar recording on a web site.  It sounded like a mix between a baby crying, a mountain lion roaring and a bull snorting.  Since then I have talked to 3 friends that have eyewitness accounts -one of them gave me a cutout of a footprint that they found near their ranch in Idaho.  It is huge and there were 3 sets of prints all different sizes.  A university in Boise came and did plaster casts.  Anyway, those that have seen are normal in every way.  If you want more info let me know.  P.S. I have a great theory that explains where sasquatch came from, why he is so intelligent and why they will never be caught or hurt another human.  Thanks for the good work and keep it up -Dan Robertson - 208-852-0429",
