Something was coming toward him. Three or four days later he returned with a friend. Again after chopping wood for about twenty to thirty minutes, they heard branch breaks and limbs cracking. Whatever it was, the approach was a little faster this time. As reported, they went back to the pickup. When he got out of the truck with the .22 rifle, the large fir tree was less than 100 feet away. After one or two steps the roar stopped him. He described the vocalization as a guttural lion roar for about two seconds. Whatever made the vocalization was behind the four foot wide fir tree. I asked him if he thought that it was using the trees to hide behind as it approached. He said he is 100 percent sure of that. He did not detect any foul odor. From exploring the area, he is aware of different sized caves throughout the region.Using trees to hide behind while moving/approaching is common Bigfoot behavior. ",
