            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness regarding her story and was happy that she responded so promptly as I have a great deal of interest in this part of Michigan and have had the chance to investigate the area on previous occasions. The land around this account has seen numerous sightings of unknown creatures for many decades, particularly in the Lost Nations Forest Area. The following is a reproduction of our discussion:Investigator:  Do you recall what time of day your encounter occurred?Witness:This had to happen at around 2-3 p.m. The reason I make that determination is because we would eat lunch first, stop to buy bait at the store on the corner of Beecher Road, and proceed to the fishing area. It was a clear sunny day. Investigator:  Is there any more description of the creature you saw regarding movement or coloration? What led you to believe that this was not an animal known to live in the area like a bear or a deer?Witness:I almost think that the creature was also eating raspberries and I began eating on the opposite side. I went deeper toward the woods and was picking berries. When I looked up, I saw a dark figure, black. It wasn't a person. I wanted it to be a person but it wasn't. It was huge. I have seen my share of bears and this was not a bear. This creature was ape-like in the face where a bear is more animal-like and I have seen bears eat berries many times. In fact, I looked at several photos of bears eating berries and this was not what I saw. Way too big and dark to be a person--this thing was massive. I was around ten, but even so I wanted to believe this was a person, but there was no way it could have been. It must have been four times my size, though I think the creature was hunched a bit, it still towered over me because I remember looking up to see it. The creature was very quiet and looking at me for I don't know how long. It was dark, black and definitely more ape like than bear like. Not human, no way. Investigator:  Could you describe the paralyzed feeling that you had?Witness:I remember being frozen with fear. I wanted to run, but I couldn't. I wanted to scream but I was too frozen to scream. I was looking at the outline of the creature through the raspberry bushes and he was looking at me and being still. I thought if I ran he could grab me, but I didn't want to stay there because I had such a feeling coming over me to get out of there. I remember telling myself turn and run, now!  That's what I did. I did not look behind me. I ran to my parents who were by the road under the bridge. I had no idea what I saw and told my mom who still remembers me telling her about it. At this point I discussed having a similar feeling come over me on several occasions. The witness felt relieved that someone else understood what she was feeling and expressed gratitude that the show Finding Bigfoot had helped her to better understand what had happened to her so long ago. She ended our conversation by stating:\"I feel now that I saw something I wasn't meant to see, but I have so much respect for what I saw.\"",
