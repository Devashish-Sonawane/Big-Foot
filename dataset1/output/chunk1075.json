They abandoned their trotline. - He described the power of the vocalizations as similar to standing in front of a speaker at a rock concert and feeling the vibrations in his chest.- I found the witness\u0092s testimony to be very forthright and detailed as he recalled his experience even though it occurred over 40 years ago.- We discussed all the other possibilities for these vocalizations and no other explanation reasonably fit with his encounter. I believe that he had a close encounter with a Bigfoot.",
