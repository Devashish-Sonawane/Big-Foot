He saw a big hairy man standing in full view as it had stepped out from behind a tree.  It was larger than his 6'2\" father and the hair was reddish brown.   CB was the only one of the children to see it but when he ran screaming back to camp the others followed not knowing what they were running from.Going back to 1962 the term Bigfoot was not used as it is now.  It wasn't until later during his high school years that the term Bigfoot circulated in the media along with pictures and descriptions.  CB believes this is what he saw that spring morning. ",
