The witness initially assumed the animal was human height, with above-average shoulder width and a stocky torso. Its hair was long and flowing, dark brown to black in color. The head was not cone shaped and the witness did not see any facial features. The animal was moving over uneven terrain in an East to West direction. The witness has returned to the area many times since his initial sighting. On recent reflection he believes the creature may have been taller than an average human based on his observation of people walking in the same general area. Of interest is a reported sighting five months later in January 2003, approximately 20 miles away in Kuckville, NY. Click here for that report.",
