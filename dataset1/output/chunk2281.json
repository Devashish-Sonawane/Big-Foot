            "Follow-Up Report": "Talked to Joe via phone again and the activity has increased, howls, whoops, wood knocks, rocks being thrown on house and car. Most of the time it has been from across the street but did see one jump behind a shed at his house in the daylight. A white haired, tall and large figure stood up from a squatting position and walked away, across the street about 30 feet away early in the morning.These sighting are usually around 4 to 4:30 am and occurring about three times a week. The woods across the street are in the Rolling Fork WMA now and protected. Joe has a new high Lumens flashlight with a sharp focus thus it enables him to shine the light with a focused beam when he wants too. The activity is usually just before daylight  around 4 a.m., but has also happened just after dark. One time one just stared at him from 30' away for a very long time before it finally blinked. Another time, a large, white-haired figure just stood up and walked away. Yet another time a dark haired figure ducked behind a shed during the daylight trying to stay out of sight.Abundance of game and a good water source makes it a good place. Very few people are nearby and I believe this is another factor for the visits.I have talked to Joe several times and believe him. Will stay in touch with Joe and update this report if any thing significant occurs. ",

Throughout the night we heard coyotes and owls but also 3 howls we could not identify, and 2 more wood knocks. We also heard at 2 different times in different areas close to camp what sounded like heavy sighs. At about 11pm I got up from the fire to go and relieve myself. I walked to the other side of my truck, about 25 ft from the fire and as I stood there I had a very strange feeling and then a rock came flying thru the air and landed about 10 feet from me. The next morning as we were looking around the camp we found 6 foot prints. 3 were good enough to cast and we did. We believe they are from a juvenile and were there from a day or two before and we just didn't see them while setting up camp the night before. This was in Saline County on land owned by a logging company.",
