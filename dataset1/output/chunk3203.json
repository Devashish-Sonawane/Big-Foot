I had just walked out to bring my dog in and it had started to sprinkle. As I took her off her leash, I looked up across the golf course and saw a form move out of the edge of the trees and run across a space of about 20 yards until it disappered into the tree-line. When I saw it, the Patterson/Gimlin footage came to mind, and I was left to belive I saw Bigfoot. The figure was about 200 or more yards from me and it was very hard to make out what it was.  I have never seen this creature again. That is probably due to a new golf course was built a year or so later and there was, and still is, a lot of construction going on there.",
