            "Observed": "My youngest daughter was about 8 when it happened, so that must have been around 1972. We had just passed Kingman, Arizona travelling back to Oklahoma. My sister was with me and our children were asleep in the back. We were driving one of those VW \"Lovebug\" type vans, so when I say that what we saw was taller than our vehicle, I am saying it was taller than that VW van. It was dark, probably around 9 p.m. or later. We were not too far out of Kingman when this creature just suddenly appeared at the side of the rode from the shoulder area. It had its hand stretched out towards us. Maybe it was keeping our lights out of its eyes. It must have been 7 feet tall. It's eyes seemed aglow and they were manevolent. It moved so fast. We were surprised to see it, and even more surprised that it kept on crossing the road. I hadn't slowed down and before you could blink an eye it seemed like it was in the middle of the road and I had to swerve to miss it and in swerving, I braked a little. My sister screamed at me, \"Don't stop, don't stop. Just keep going.\" It had less hair on it's face than anywhere else. The hair on its arms was real long and it had hair everywhere else on its body. It seemed big and husky and it seemed like a man and at the same time it didn't. It seemed wild. It's hair was the color of like dark blonde. We didn't look back after we swerved. We were scared and we just got out of there!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Tonight I called and talked with Wanda York, who is now 73 years old, and she still vividly remembers her brief encounter with a bigfoot animal, while driving through Arizona in 1972.  Wanda her sister Betty, and Wanda`s daughter, who was eight years old and asleep at that time, were traveling west bound, towards Kingman, Arizona, on Highway 66.  The encounter was just a short distance east of Kingman and a little after the sun had set. That\u2019s when the two sisters viewed this malevolent appearing creature crossing the old highway 66, from south to north.I asked Wanda the following questions about her encounter:Where did this incident occur?  \"It was just a few miles east of Kingman, Arizona, on highway 66, which was then the main east west highway through that area.\"What date did this take place?  \"1972.\"What time of year was it?  \"Summer.\"Do you remember the month? \"No!\"Was it day or night? \"It was dark, a little after sunset.\"Describe the area in which this incident occurred.  From what I could remember, the area had small pine tress on both sides of the highway.\" Where about in Arizona did this happen? \"Located in the north west corner of the state.\"What distance would you estimate you were from this thing when you saw it?  \"We were about twenty five feet in front of it, as it crossed the road in front of our VW van.\"What was your first reaction? I was terrified! What was it doing?  \"Walking across the road, and as our lights lit him up, he put up one of his arms as if to block the light from getting into his eyes, but at the same time it looked as though he wanted us to stop the van.Were you alone when you first saw this? No, my sister Betty, and my daughter were in the van, but my daughter was asleep.\"What's is his/her name?  \"Sister's name is Betty Wolfe.\"Did it stand and walk on two legs? \"Yes! It ran across the road in front of us.\"Did you see it go down on all fours? \"No! It just used his two legs.\"Was it covered in hair? \"Yes! It was covered with wavy hair.\"What color was it?  \"It was a light brown in color, with blond streaks running thorough the brown, and Wanda's sister described it as being a whitish blond in color.\"How tall would you estimate this thing to have been?  \"It was well over six feet tall.\"What would you estimate its weight to have been? Wanda used her husband as a weight guide, and she estimated the creature to be at least 190 lbs. or more.Did you see any facial features? \"It looked like an ape, and I just noticed the eyes.\" Could you describe them? \"The eyes were gleaming, and seemed to be evil looking.\"Could you describe the arms? \"I only noticed the arm when it put it up as to try and protect it self from the van lights or maybe just from being hit by the van.\"Could you tell if it was a male or a female? \"I only assumed it was probably a male, because it looked as if it were a male.  I really didn't see any anatomical parts to prove either way, but I noticed that it had narrow hips and broad shoulders.\"About for how long did you see it? \"I had to be less than a minute. \"Did it ever make any noise?  \"We never heard any noise from the creature.\"Did it ever make any animal sounds from its mouth? \"No!\"Did it see you?  \"Yes! It was looking directly at us.\"     \tDid you smell anything?  \"No!\"Did you check for footprints?  \"No!\"Did you report what you saw?  (IE) Parents or any agency?  \"No!\"What was their response? N/A.In your own words describe what happened.  Wanda reiterated her original report.  All except for their direction of travel, in which they were west bound towards California.  The reason for the mix up is that Wanda's daughter filled out and sent in the original report, and she was not cognizant of the direction of travel at that time.In Summary: The two women that had this creature encounter were horrified at its sight, and thought of it as being an evil and/or a malevolent being.  After talking with Wanda, I believe that she and her sister Betty observed a bigfoot creature crossing that Arizona road on that fateful night in 1972.",

            "Observed": "My friend and I wanted to go fishing at bear pond so we left my house at about 6 pm. We went topwater fishing because of the approaching sunset. We went in a canoe and fished along the edge of the entire pond.  It started to get too dark to cast accurately considering all of the trees along the edge overhang the water. We decided to start heading to the docking area to go home. By now it was completely dark and there are no houses in the back part of the pond just woods and rivers and some preety steep hills that go on forever.We were at a complete stop in the canoe between the mainland and an island when all of a sudden we both heard a loud scream comming from the mainland up on a hill. It sounded like a mix between a young girl screaming and a weard bird like sound.We both looked at each other and said \"What the hell was that\".Again it happened and again. Just as the sound stopped something started to RUN in the mainland woods about 50 yards from us.The sound was very loud like crashing and running.",

It did the sound 2 more times before we got out of there like a bat out of hell.The grunting sound was very intimidating. Also I went to the same spot where we heard the running a few weeks later and went hiking. I found some intersting piles of rocks and there were what looked like branches lined up and stacked against trees making almost like a makeshift shelter or like a crappy made tee-pee without the cloth outside.",
