Though apprehensive about going back to the spot, he and his friends did return to see what evidence, if any, they could find. I applauded him on braving a return and did my best to reassure him that to my knowledge, there were no reports of a human being attacked. Intimidated yes, but not harmed. I believe he sounded relieved to that fact. I traveled to Tipp City to locate the area. Though I could not locate the aforementioned path off the main trail, I did see that there was several deer paths along the walking/biking trail, and one path had the appearance that something of large size had passed through the tall plants. The above link are photos I took at the location and surrounding area during my follow-up investigation. ",
