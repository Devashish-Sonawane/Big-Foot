My grandfather owns about 4,000 acres in Coweta County. The land consists of a small cabin, some barns, 3 lakes, and lots of off road trails winding and criss crossing everywhere throughout the woods. My father, grandfather, uncle, and 1 cousin hunt the land as much as possible during the hunting season. We had our own 4 wheelers and would depart to our separate tree stands or specific areas to hunt each day. We have all hunted this land for a very long time, since i was 10 years old. Never before have any of us seen, heard ,or even thought about bigfoots being in these woods,ever!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking to the witness, I can add this to the story.The witness has had 10 years of hunting on this land which is owned by his grandfather. He has never encountered any other strange sounds, smells or sights while hunting.The encounter happened just inside the woodline next to a powerline cut in the northeastern corner of the property. He described it as the most remote. The woods consists mainly of 50-100 year old Georgia Longleaf Pine with a thick pine needle groundcover. After discussing with the witness, he went on to state he initially saw the creature's dark silhouette walking/running along the treeline at a fast pace. He saw it turn towards the woods maybe twice before reaching the opening where he was. He stated that his view lasted maybe 2 seconds of the creature and included mainly the torso area, to include part of the arms. He did not get a good look at the face. He described the chest as being largely built with 3-4 inch light reddish brown hair across it. He also stated he saw the arms swing \"lower than usual\" and were swinging. He also stated that the creature \"seemed to be twisting a bit while moving\". He stated the opening view of the powerline was approximately 25 feet and he estimated it was 50 feet from his treestand.  He stated the creature took one step across it without slowing down. It appeared to continue the same \"stalking\" and peering into the woods until it disappeared out of sight. He did not hear anything other than the deer, yet the smell got worse then lessened after awhile. He did not check for tracks then or the next day as he felt spooked by the encounter and did not want to return.The land has recently been sold to a golf course developer. They will be allowed to hunt on this land for only two more years.He states that he does not hunt in those woods anymore and that the encounter has continued to bother him.",
