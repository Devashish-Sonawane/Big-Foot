Although this incident happened over 20 years ago, he remembers the details clearly.When the animal was first sighted, Mr. Stephens' brother thought for a second that he had seen elk, which made Mr. Stephens look in that direction. It then became clear that the animals were not elk or bear.The animals were  tall, very muscular, and walked as a wrestler would. The larger one had arms longer than a man's and very muscular. The younger/smaller one was only a little lighter in color than the other. Both were very dark with the larger one near black in color.  Both had rounded heads, like a human. The brothers were shaken up over the incident. Mr Stephens noted that his brother was in such a hurry to get in the car that he injured his lip. ",
