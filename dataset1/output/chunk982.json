As I stated before, I didn't use my camera for obvious reasons. The larger male(10 O'clock) stomped and threw branches. Those hyena/coyote like cackling, the deep and very loud growl/grunt, and the horse whinny type of shout afterwards. Also sounded like a bunch of other sounds like if someone was trying to confuse me or something. (That's why I thought someone was trying to pull off a hoax....)",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Several TBRC investigators and I met the witness on 10/26/02. We discussed his report in detail. We also recorded the interview on minidisk. The witness had voiced in his first email to us that he was hesitant about contacting us. He did seem to be visibly shaken while recounting his story, and he seemed uncomfortable when we were in the area of the encounter. His encounter occurred on a Saturday, Dec. 8 2001. It was a cool, clear day. The witness had gone out to some private property at the insistence of the property owner, who is his friend. This piece of property is approximately 5 or 6 acres. It is heavily wooded and there is a trailer there. There are several creeks that run through the area. While the friend was doing some fence repair, the witness noticed some movement in the treeline. He could not make out what was moving, only that it was fairly large. The horses on the property had been acting skittish all day long. Later, after hearing some noises, they followed what was making the noises into a wooded area. They heard something big moving through the trees and underbrush. They were then confronted by a large Bigfoot. It was described as being 8 to 9 foot tall, at least 500 lbs, upwards to possibly even 1000 lbs. It had an erect posture, not slumped or hunched over. The shoulders were very wide, 4 feet or so across. The facial features were a frowning mouth, large, dark eyes that did not reflect eye shine with a flashlight. The neck was short and the head was round, not conical. It was covered with straight, short (1 inch long or so) hair, silver gray in color. The hair did not cover the face, but did cover the body. The hair on the head was slightly longer than on the body. The skin on the face was a tannish color. This animal was observed for at least 5 and maybe even 10 minutes at a distance of 25-30 yards. It was acting in an aggressive manner, throwing tree branches at the 2 witnesses. The reporting witness was considering taking a shot at the animal with his .45 handgun. They then noticed a smaller animal in the treeline directly in front of them. It was a foot or so shorter than the other animal. This was did not act aggressively towards them. It was assumed that this was a female, although no breasts were observed. The witnesses backed out of the area. As they left, they heard a loud, almost horse whinny type of sound. They retreated to their vehicle and left the area. They returned the next day and found some footprints leading toward the water. They were in a muddy area and it looked like they had been sliding. One of the tracks appeared to have 4 toes. The step between the tracks was longer than a humans. We then went with the witness to the general vicinity of the area. The property owner does not want this reported, so we did not have access to the property. We did stop at Caddo Creek, the creek that flows through the property into Lake Tawakoni. On the east side of Hwy 34, we noticed several times that the sounds of the insects died down. This did not happen on the west side. There was a good breeze. While we were there for 30 minutes or so observing with Gen III night vision and then spotlights, we did not see anything. There was a very bad odor that would waft in for a few seconds and then disappear many times. It had the distinctive odor of death, and may have just been a dead animal in the area. We will hopefully be able to talk to the property owner and gain access to the property. If so, we will file a follow-up report. The property owner was aware of these animals passing through his property. He does not seek any publicity. TBRC Investigator\u00a9Copyright 1999-2002 Texas Bigfoot Research Center ",
