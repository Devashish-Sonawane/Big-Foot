            "Observed": "I was going out early morning fishing with my friend Ross and we live up by Escanaba, MI and we were out on a pretty remote road Brampton 27.5 road by the Days River. We got out to check out an area, see how the river is, all of a sudden we hear a real heavy sounding animal moving through the thick Tag Alders and brush on the non riverside of the road but right as that goes silent we hear another big creature on the river side, it goes from just making enough noise for us to notice that there is 2 big animals that seemed to be traveling together and it seems like we had interrupted them crossing the road so the one that was like 30 to 40 feet away suddenly does what I can only imagine was a bluff charge through the thick brush just knocking every Tad Alder and branch down with authority. Then after about 20 feet it stops and a few seconds later we both hear a tree getting just ripped down with force. It then like went silent on us, I was trying to see in the thick brush to get a visual but i never did get to see it, but i could hear it trying to hide in the straw grass. I could hear it swaying I believe I threw some rocks to try an illicit a response but there was no rocks it could of thrown back and that pretty much it the river had prevented me from just going in after it. Ross wanted to leave and I didn't swim across and investigate like I should have, its been a big regret. We were supposed to go fishing so we left. It seemed too intelligent to just be a bear and if I had interrupted a bear and cub I would think my aggressive attitude I used for that investigation would have gotten me attacked, had it been bear. It was 40 - 50 feet away tops.",
