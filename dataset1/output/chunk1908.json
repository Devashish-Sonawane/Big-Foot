            "Observed": "My name is Christie Sproull, am 39 yrs old. I live in Scio,Harrison Co., Ohio. In the summer of 2011 My friend was staying in a tent in my yard for about 2 months. She said she could hear something big walking toward her tent. Then one night i was in the house on Facebook around 2 am and my girlfriend was on her laptop in her tent on Facebook. She messaged me to come outside right away that something was sniffing loudly and breathing heavy walking around her tent. I walked outside thinking she just was freaking herself out thinking she was hearing things. I kind of laughed it off, open the door and yelled if she was ok. She yelled for me to come to the tent so I grabbed a flashlight and walked down. I didn't see anything. If there was something there it ran away. I told her it was a deer. She was not convinced.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. I asked her to take me through the events that led to her report. From the fall of 2011 to the fall of 2012 there were many different events experienced by members of her family.They lived in the next to last house on a dead end road, on the outskirts of Scio. Behind the house was a vast woods that was only interrupted by a few roads and rural houses until the next town.In the fall of 2011, her two daughters were returning home in the evening and saw something large, swishing it's arm around in their above ground pool. It saw them and ran off into the woods.The following spring they had just had a 'hog roast' and a relative was staying in a tent in the back yard. She messaged her that something big was walking around the tent 'sniffing' it. She went out side with a flashlight and yelled but didn't see anything.In the fall of 2012, she was taking her puppy out to do it's business and was walking back by the wood line. There was some moon light and she was standing by this bush that you would normally be able to see though, when something that was crouching down suddenly stood up behind it. Seeing the outline of a creature towering over her on two legs, she let out a scream and ran back to the house. Her husband and son came to see what was wrong and grabbed flashlights and went out to investigate. They saw something large on two legs running up the hill behind the house and gave chase but it out distanced them quickly and disappeared over the hilltop. These sightings are within a mile of two previous reports in as many years in this area.",

            "Also Noticed": "Nothing else noted at that specific location, but some years later a caver from the same group was with me at another bizarre event. About six miles to the south west of this camp location we found an unknown cave in a remote grazing area. The entrance was partially blocked by breakdown (boulders) but enterable on hands and knees after climbing over the rocks. Just inside the entrance there's a low room with a stream in the floor that flows into passage heading down stream, deeper into the mountain. Blocking our way was the carcass of a large white tail doe. Something had been feeding on the carcass, as the entrails and soft tissue between the rear legs was pulled out or gone. Deer hair was also strewn about the floor and walls of the cave passage. We had to crawl gingerly over the carcass in order to push farther into the cave. It was relatively fresh (maybe a few days old) but odor had begun to kick in. Downstream of the carcass we noticed a red tinge in the water, blood was staining the stream. We had enough then, turned around and left the cave. My friend wretched once we got to the surface. We both wondered what kind kind of animal had the motivation and strength to haul a large doe up and over boulders and through a narrow entrance before stashing it. We assumed either bear or coyote and decided to come back well after the carcass would be gone. We've yet to return.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to DK on the phone and he is certain that what he and his fellow campers heard that night was not a human, a coyote or a panther. He has spent countless hours exploring wilderness areas of different parts of the United States and is acutely familiar with the sounds of many animals. He described the sound as coming from approximately 200 yards away, lasting between 3-5 seconds and starting with a low pitch and ending with a higher pitch. He had difficulty in comparing it to anything else, but he stated that it sounded somewhat \u0091simian\u0092, or perhaps, vaguely like a woman\u0092s scream. He also added that no person could have come close to mimicking the scream. When asked to describe what it sounded like, he replied that it was sort of a \u0091Whhooo-aaahhh\u0092 type of vocalization and that in his estimation, whatever produced it must have had considerable lung volume because of the loudness of it.I also asked him about the deer carcass he and a friend had found cached in a cave in the same vicinity. He described the carcass as being fairly fresh (although odoriferous) and mostly intact except for the soft belly and genital area which had been torn open and which appeared that part of the organs had been consumed. He stated that the carcass appeared to be about three days old, but given the low temperatures, obvious decay had not begun to set in, except for the smell. He did not note which organs were still intact, or missing. He did recall that other than the belly being open, the rest of the deer appeared remarkably intact, except that some of the scruff hair on the back and the neck was missing. And other than the open belly, there were no obvious chew marks or claw marks on the carcass. When asked about the cave itself, he described it as having an entrance approximately 3-4 foot wide by 2-3ft tall, which led to a larger cavity inside. There were some boulders partially obstructing the entrance and the deer had been carried over the boulders to where it was cached. He mentioned that there was a trickle of water, or tiny stream, going from the mouth of the cave to further inside that was tainted with blood, presumably by the deer carcass. When asked if a large animal, such as a sasquatch, could have fit into the opening, he was certain that it was highly possible. He told me that he is a large man, 6 foot tall, and he was easily able to crawl into the cave.DK told me that when they heard the scream, and when he found the deer carcass, it did not enter his mind that these things could have been sasquatch related. However, it has always puzzled him as to what could have produced a scream like that, or how and why a deer could have been carried into that cave by the known carnivores in the vicinity. It was only later, after finding the BFRO website and reading some of the reports from the same area, that DK began to realize that the events could be related to a sasquatch. I found DK to be very reasonable, honest and forthright and do believe that he may very well have heard a sasquatch.",
