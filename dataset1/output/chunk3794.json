An hour or two after we went to bed I was still awake because the rest of the group hadn't made it to the lake and I was worried about them. A wind break of poles about 6' tall was beside us and a head was moving along on the far side of it. I thought it was one of our group. When it got to the far end of the wind break it squated down and began going through my pack. This didn't bother me because I thought that one of our group needed something. I said \"You finally made it.\" It stood up and at this point and I realized it was a foot or two higher than the wind break. Between the moon and what was left of the fire I could see what some years later people were calling Bigfoot. It turned and walked away into the night.",

We had seen an incredible amount of wildlife that day. I had just sat down and for some reason just looked up at a ridge across the river. This ridge was a focal point. It [the sasquatch] was about 17 to 20 feet from the top and in two or three strides it made it to the top. It immediately turned toward me and placed both hands on its hips. Of course, I was dumbfounded. I had seen lots of bear and this was not one. It stood there for several seconds and the freaky thing was I knew it was looking right at me. Finally, it turned around and walked down the back side of the ridge. It was at this moment I realized what it was by the was it sort of swayed when it walked.",
