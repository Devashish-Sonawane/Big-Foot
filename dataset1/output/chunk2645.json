It was getting dark but the fish were biting good, so we sat there a little longer catching fish.  I didn\u0092t have a flashlight, so I told my boys we needed to get going. But we stayed until we could only see shadows of our poles.",

There was no one else there while they were fishing.  They were on public property next to the fence line that borders private land.  He thought there were utilities or a water treatment facility on the other side of the fence.  They had fished there before.  It was beneath a high embankment; \"15-30 feet\".  They used a trail the witness believed to be 30 feet long that leads to a clearing by the river. They caught several fish, and had five on a stringer, but hadn't done any cleaning of the fish while at the river.  The witness and his son described birds being disturbed by something moving through the woods and hearing heavy steps coming towards them.  He could hear branches breaking when the animal came running towards them as he reached his truck.",
