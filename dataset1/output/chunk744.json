While driving home in late January of 2013 the witness notices something in the middle of the road as he approached a slight curve, suddenly the dark mass stands and quickly moves to the edge of the woods as he approaches. The Bigfoot had just enough time to make it to the tree when the witness passed by. It was holding onto a limb while peering around and down from behind the large tree as he passed. The sheer size was hard to believe, and the bright yellow-green shine of its eyes was very intense. ",

I couldn\u0092t understand why the deer ran right through our site, within 75 feet of our picnic table, when there was so much open space all around us. I thought that perhaps we would see a mountain lion right behind the deer, chasing it. But nothing came.  It had come from direction of the B loop, which was completely abandoned, closed off and quiet. I wanted to walk over to the B loop and look around, but intuition told me to stay put. I have no idea if this was related, but it was one of three strange incidents on our camping trip.",
