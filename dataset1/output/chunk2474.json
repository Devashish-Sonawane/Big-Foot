It looked like a large hairy person on it's hands and knees chasing somthing small across the road like a feild mouse. I said, What is that? My mom had to slow down to keep from hitting it and when we were about 15 to 20 feet away it got up on its hind legs like a man about 6'6\" to 7' tall and walked quickly off the road in to the night in 2 steps.",
