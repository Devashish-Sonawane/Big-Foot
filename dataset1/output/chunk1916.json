            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a paranormal investigator. He started investigating a very old and remote cemetery in the summer of 2011. The cemetery is so old no one goes there. He and his colleagues on several occasions heard what sounded like things being thrown at them and wood knocks.  This went on for several weeks, and they thought it was noise from a haunting. They later started hearing howls and whoops which they were able to record on tape.  Unfortunately the recordings were of poor quality and the photos of the tracks were taken with a cell phone so they did not show enough detail. While doing research on what could be making the sounds, they discovered that typical bigfoot behavior involves - throwing objects, wood knocks, whoops and howls. They also discovered that there are many reports of bigfoots in graveyards. See Stan Courtney's article on Cemeteries and Squatches.One morning, after a night of investigating, they walked to the edge of the cemetery toward a rock outcropping. They were shocked to see two large dark brown bigfoots. The larger one, approximately 7 feet tall, stood staring at them for about 2 minutes.  When they attempted to get closer, the bigfoots turned to walk away but not before the smaller adult reached down and grabbed a baby. The baby had been sitting in the tall grass. The witness describes the baby as about the size of a human 3 year old. When it grabbed the baby it lifted it up and sat it on its shoulder. They rapidly walked into the woods with their arms swinging, in a fluid motion but did not seem alarmed. Once the witness had seen the bigfoots, they returned many times hoping for another encounter. They have heard howls and screams, breaking branches, and found tracks of different sizes.  They have had many return whoops. They have also found stick structures that were large enough for a 6\u00923\u0094 frame to walk into. The witnesses described the bigfoots in better detail:- The three were dark brown, not black.- The larger adult had a pug nose and human-like features.- The head shape was more pointed than round.- Arms seemed to be down to their knees. While out bigfooting one evening, four other gentleman pulled up. They were active duty infantry trained Army soldiers camping in the area and bigfooting as well.  I spoke with one on the phone, and he also had had an encounter one night camping there. On a cold night in February, the four had just started to eat dinner when they noticed a \u0093wet dirty dog\u0094 smell. They also heard heavy, but slow footsteps and breaking branches. The four fanned out in a triangulated search, thinking they could force it out by the lake. They were surprised that it seemed to slip past them. They were unnerved enough that before they began a night watch, they fired a warning shot in the air. They took turns at watch and did not hear, see, or smell anything else that night.  Because of this experience they have returned to the area.Google earth image of the area:",

I lived there for about 15 years just north of the river bridge. I was 15 years old at the time and I was coming home from Morris with a friend.  We had pulled off the side of the road. My friend was outside the vehicle when we heard this horrible noise like a shrieking growl and before we knew it we saw a large human-like animal coming towards the car. I began screaming get in the car locked my door and we took off ending up doing about 90 mph fleeing. When I got home I was so terrified, that feeling has never left me. My family that was at my house when I arrived home has ridiculed me to this day and I do not travel that road for any reason any longer.",
