            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for over an hour. His descriptions were clear and concise regarding the location and a description of the call he heard. On a subsequent visit to the site I was able to interview the other witness. They both heard and described the same call. It was about a 7-8 second howl that started out somewhat low and oscillated to a higher note then back down to the lower howl. It was repeated three times and that was it. No return calls were noted.The main witness is hunter and tracker. He has impressive knowledge of the area and the local game. He is also aware of sasquatch and local lore. He is a bow hunter and has the patience to move extremely slowly to track his prey. He said he is not familiar with any animal that could produce the long sustained calls he heard coming from the ridge. That is what prompted him to seek outside assistance. The Wynoochee Valley and up into the Olympics Mts above Wynoochee dam have a rich history of bigfoot related incidents -- sightings, vocalizations, track finds.The area has one of the highest concentrations of elk on the Olympic Peninsula. In this part of the country, elk concentration seems to be the most important factor in predicting the concentration of sasquatches. I know of a different local incident, involving a different witness. This incident happened three nights prior to these witnesses hearing the vocalization up on the ridge. One week after filing the report this witness called me back to let me know a curious observation. He went down to the river and noticed that a log had been moved. He had been clearing brush the day before and knew where the log was originally located . The next day he noted the log had been moved. He estimates the log weighed in excess of 600lbs. What got his curiosity up was the fact that the log had been rolled up hill. The area around the log was not conducive to reveal any foot prints. This location is on private property. He would know immediately if somebody were on his land. Any vehicle driven in would be visible from his house. When he is not there his property is gated.",

The witness was in the back seat on the passenger side looking out the window when he observed an animal rise from a squatting position to a standing position on two legs.  This animal was described to be tall approximately 7-8 feet in height, and lean, not thin, but muscular. He could not give me any facial details because he stated The animal raised its \"hand\" palm outward to cover its eyes. He stated the hand was very large and that he remembers when the animal moved to cover its eyes, the hand was down below the knee area swinging upward to the face, covering it.  He said he did not note whether there was a  point on this animal's head because of the large hand obscuring the face.  He could not say whether the hand had hair on the palm or whether it was dark skin, but was quite sure it was a hand and not a paw.  This animal was brown in color with what appeared to be human like hair covering its body.  When asked about the other occupants of the car he was sure they had all seen the animal because they originally thought it was a man on the side of the road miles from any town.  They discussed how odd it was for someone to do that at that time of night all alone, however, in further discussion realized the \"man\" wasn't wearing any discernible clothes and was very large.  He stated he would try to locate the other four witnesses and would foward that information if he was successful.  They were aquaintances who were all in a play.  It had been ten years since he had spoken with any of them, but that he would try to locate them to verify the sighting.  More information will be forthcoming at a later date if the other witnesses can be located and interviewed.  ",
