Status of the dog is unknown.The black unmarked vehicles ,owning agency ,is unknown. (could be either Federal or MSP)I contacted both the Maryland State Police, and the Sykesville P.D.I was unable to verify the police response, as they tell me they do not keep non-criminal records from back that far. Witness also recalled some bones, described as \"Very large human(?)\", (rib cage, some leg & arm) being recovered from an area downstream, from the riverbank. These were turned over to the coroner. Status unknown.If anyone has further info on this sighting,  or any other sightings in this area, E-mail me at Vw_bear@yahoo.com. Please include this case number. Thank you",
