            "Observed": "My name is Dr. XXXXXXXXXXX I'm a chiropractor. One afternoon a few weeks back, I was on my way from Show Low, AZ to a ranch past Concho, AZ to work with a horse.  I'm certified in animal skeletal adjusting (chiropractic for animals.) Between the Y in the highway and Concho, about 6 miles outside of Concho, at about 2:30 PM, on a clear, sunny day (Oct. 26, 2006), I saw something come up onto the road about a half mile in front of me.  At first, I thought it might be a very large dog as it initially was coming up onto the road, but as it fully entered the highway, I could see that it stood straight up, to a height about as tall as a road sign, maybe 6 or 7 feet?  It had long, dark brown hair from top to bottom and stood absoulutely straight up, no slouch, no forward bending at all. It ran across the road from my right toward my left and remained fully standing as it ran off into the brush.  The full incident took maybe 10 seconds.",

He is very certain that he saw a dark brown biped cross the highway at around 2:30 pm.A few details to add:- He was driving around 70 mph and saw an animal step up onto the road from the right side about 1/2 mile ahead.  As he rapidly approached the biped it crossed the road without turning to look toward the vehicle.  He slowed at the location where the \"sasquatch\" disappeared in the juniper trees on his left side. - At first he was shocked to see it then he was impressed by the very erect posture.  The biped moved with a steady gait without an exaggerated arm swing.  It was covered in dark brown hair that he could only guess was 4\" to 6\" long.  At the distance and speed he was driving he is not able to provide any more detail. - Elevation in this area is 5000' to 6000' , the elevation drops toward the northeast away from the Mogollon Rim.
