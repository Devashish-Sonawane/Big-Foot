I first heard of this so called legend back in the early 80's from a family member that lived in the area. Supposedly, there is a large hairy creature that lives in the River Styx swamp area. He noted the alleged creature looked very large even at 200 yards away. When it crossed the opening between the two woodlines, its strides appeared to be enormous. Would have never made the report if it wasn't for report number Report #8587.The sighting location can be seen in the distance right in the middle of the picture. The creature crossed the small open meadow between the two woodlines.",
