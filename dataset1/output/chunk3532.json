            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness about these incidents for a couple hours, and found him to be sincere about what he experienced.  According to him, the slope that the creature walked up on, using two legs, would be very hard for a human to climb, without using one's arms.  This occurred about 10 PM.  The scream came from their north, the direction the creature ran towards, and lasted about 8 seconds.  It wasn't too far away, possibly 1000 feet. The passenger side window was left open a bit, and there was food portioned out onto dinner plates on the passenger seat.  One of the witness' friends saw the hairy arm reach in for the food (the witness himself didn't see this, but was told about it afterward).  Two plates were taken, containing macaroni, beans, and hot dogs.  A year later they returned to the same general area for more camping.  He got the impression that whatever was coming down the hillside was trying to be quiet.  The two friends he was with had awakened when the cooler fell in the camp; when they talked about the noise all sounds from outside the tent quieted.  Eventually the camp intruder had come up to the tent and looked down inside of it; the witness had been awake at this time and stared at it for about 5 seconds.  After it moved out of view, he heard it cross the creek and assumed it left.  Nothing else happened that night.  There were no footprints to be found on the dry, compact ground, and no food was taken.The 'bedding' areas in the cabin were made of piled up leaf litter.Please see report #25658 for the more recent incident.
