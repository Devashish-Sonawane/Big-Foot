A bunch of the grandchildren including myself were playing hide & seek it was nearing sun down I kept getting caught early in the game & decided to venture outside of the fenced area and up the gravel road about 200 yards to an old corn crib in a field next to the road. If my memory serves me right the crib was next to empty, the door was facing away from the road and it was starting to get dark, I entered the crib in a hurry not paying any attention to what may be in the crib, while looking through the cracks in the crib towards the house to see if anyone had seen me enter, I heard a heavy breathing behind me, upon turning around what I saw was indescribable for a kid my age, this huge man like creature was standing over me just staring at me he was hairy and huge it made no sounds and smelled some what like a hog pen which everyone raised in that area and time. After wetting my pants and running like a bat outof hell back to the house crying and scared to death, I told my uncle what I had seen, only he did not take me serious and started making fun of me, because I had peed my pants. I will swear to this day what saw was a bigfoot.",

            "Observed": "I, Stephen Rees of Paradise CA now , was spending the summer of 1967 in Spirit Lake with Steve Shaw at his father and step mothers home . Mr. and Mrs. Ruth Shaw. We, Steve-Dale Sckelenger and myself, were bucking bales of haw at the Harold Glabb farm, some 10 to 15 miles away . We were in Dale's red 1956 ford PU and we were coming back to Spirit Lake on a narrow dusty road. It was not far from the Glabb farm and the road had a thick growth of lodge pole pine on either side of the road . This is where the hair on the back of my neck started tingling, which prompted me, sitting in the middle, to turn around and look behind me . What I saw was a quiet tall long haired bipedal mamal with the hair from head to toe, complete four steps to get accross the road. As soon as we passed the place it came out onto the road and it made it across before the distance and dust hid it from view.",
