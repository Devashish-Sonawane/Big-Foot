As it got within 75 yards it stopped and turned forty five degrees to the left and went through a hollow and walking out of sight.  We were amazed and tried to track it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After talking with this witness at length, I can add the following information:The witness was with his cousin and another gentleman on some private property owned by a relative.  They were making deer calls when everything went quiet.  He thought this was very strange.  They both then visualized a large black animal, which was thought to be a bear at first glance.  The animal proceeded to stand up on two legs and \u0093trot\u0094 off,  with arms swinging greatly.  At first the animal ran towards them and then away at an angle.  The face was flat with no snout, and it \u0093looked like a gorilla from the Knoxville Zoo, but bigger and on two legs\".  He also stated that he had looked on the BFRO website and viewed the Patterson footage, and stated this animal was \u0093fatter\u0094 and \u0093had more hair than Patty.\u0094  He estimated the hair to be around four inches in length. The height was estimated at around seven feet.  The color appeared a mixture of brown and black when the creature was moving  One of the men did shoot in an upward direction with his shotgun out of fear.  No prints were noticed in the area due to the large number of pine needles and debris on the ground.  Overall, I found this witness very credible in his account of the event, being an avid hunter he knows what a bear looks like. I believe he observed a sasquatch.",

But perhaps not. The dog was not afraid of people. And she was NOT friendly to strangers. I can't imagine her being so frightened if it was just a human being in our camp. More likely she would have nailed him!",
