            "Follow-Up Report": "Speaking to the gentleman over the phone, he said that he observed three pairs of eyes moving laterally behind his house and into the woods.  He also said that he is a long time coon hunter and has never seen any eye shine in the woods at night like this.  The eyes appeared to be as red as a coke bottle's cap, but larger.  He did not notice any \"bounce\" in the eyes, so whatever it was moved in a smooth gait.  There is steep terrain and thick cover where they entered the woods, but whatever it was seemed to move quickly and easily.The following morning he walked to the location where he saw the eyes disappear into the woods and found a fresh tree branch break approximately 4-5\" in diameter. He didn't think to look for tracks, but the ground cover did not lend well to showing footprints. He also struggled to climb to where he lost sight of them, even though whatever it was managed the terrain easily the previous night.  His neighbor's dogs had began barking at approximately 11:30 PM and had continued for an hour or so and this seemed very strange to him. He had also heard knocks approximately five minutes apart a few weeks prior to this incident.He believed if Bigfoots existed, they were only in the Pacific Northwest. He seemed very sincere and excited about the glowing eyes that he witnessed. There was not sufficient light to reflect, we believe Bigfoots are using their own light in their eyes to allow what is reported quite often by witnesses and investigators. They could possibly use this ability to signal or identify each other. The capability to glow without nearby light is called bioluminescence. The BFRO has received numerous reports from Mineral County, including these two  incredible class A's in close proximity to this home:Report #21894 Report #23437 ",

            "Observed": "A mexican brush picker in this area was picking brush to sell when he heard this sound from an old skid road as if something was making a lot of growls, squils and brush breaking so he thought he would find out what it was! The growling got real loud. He then he stepped up this side hill and on the other side Rodregies said he saw a bear, black in colour laying over a vinemaple and not moving.\" So he moved slowly closer when just in front of him about 50 feet away was this very large thing standing up. It was about 7 feet tall, dark brown in colour and it had it's back to him so he got on his hands and knees and watched this thing called Bigfoot that he had heard about in this area. Rodregies said the creature just stopped what ever it was doing and turned quickly and looked at him with eyes of fire. He said they were very red like a devil and that's when he ran to the truck screaming the devil is after him. The Bigfoot had red glowing eyes and the winess said he will never go back into the woods again. His boss took the crew out of the area because they are afraid of this Bigfoot. Rodregies wife called me and said her husband will not go to work and they are moving to another State but wanted to tell someone about it. She saw me on Evening Magazine, Kings Seattle, Washington show and got hold of me with the story. Her husband claimed there was blood everywhere and the Bigfoot had a large cut on it's back and it was bleeding.",
