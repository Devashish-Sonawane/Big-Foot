            "Observed": "Hello , my name is shawn age 26 . I just heard about the BFRO today from my mother who told me right away about this bigfoot investigation team coming to marquette and this subject is something im very passionate about especially after an encounter my bestfriend erik and i had a couple years ago , the only people i ever told was some family and ofcouse discussing with my buddy over the years since . So the night it happend was i believe in 2004 and sometime in late january . we were driving on the back road  just past Acocks Sanitarium on a dirt road that goes up to the right and heads back to some railroad tracks and LOTS of woodland . well it was between 9 and 10 and we very board and trying to find new places where we could snowboard so we decided to pull over there and walk up the road and see if we could find some good size hills back there . we got a couple flashlights out of my buddys car and started walking up the road past the gate . not even about 300 feet away from the gate we heard a strange sound but didnt think anything of it so we kept walking . i noticed what looked like very large prints in the snow to my right and right away thought it was from someone on snowshoes but even though it was late at night there was quite a bit of light out so even with the flashlights not on the prints you could see clearly they were to far apart in stride so this struck erik and i . we shined our lights closer on them and realized they were NOT from a snowshoer but there was clearly shaped FOOT prints , toes and all . it was very warm that day and even that night was pretty nice so i kept telling myself there is no way that its a bigfoot print and was telling myself that maybe the snow had melted a bit and made a footprint look larger but then i realized ok thats silly because its an actual FOOT print , clear as day and why would someone walk around the snow in bare feet and who would have feet that are that big . my flashlight was 12 inches long and i put it alongside it and the print was still quite larger than that and very wide . erik had a disposible camera in his car so i ran down and grabbed it and i even took a picture of the print . the stride on it also was very far apart , i walked in the snow next to it and i had to seriously spread my legs out far just to come close to the stride of these prints . i would almost have to run and leap to make those strides . so that really got me thinking and so erik and i were standing there discussing this whole thing not beliveing that it was real and not even 5 minutes after talking a huge tree across the road and down a little bank about 20 feet from us started shaking violently and the snow was falling off it and branches breaking so erik started running back towards the car and i followed . we sat in the car for a minute to just gather ourselfs of what it could have been and till this day we swear by what we saw . this is the first time ive ever wrote of this . and i just gotta say i think your BFRO is a great thing and i know someday bigfoot will be proven true .",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness about his experience.  He was able to recount clearly what he experienced that night.  He and his friend were scouting the area for possible snowboarding locations, and initially heard some sounds from the forest that they dismissed (small branches breaking, something moving through the snow).  They then came upon a set of footprints in the snow, which led into the forest.  The first print, right off the dirt road, was the clearest.  The tracks were estimated at 14-15 inches long, with about a 5 foot stride.  They were in this area for a few minutes, looking at the prints and discussing what they found, when behind them in a gully a tree starting shaking violently, knocking snow off the branches.  This may have occurred to intimidate them enough to make them leave the area.  They left soon afterwards.The area is near the Morgan Heights Sanatorium.",

            "Observed": "I lived in Chehalis Washington on Senn Road across from Warehouser land. I had 2 close contact experiences as a child there. The fist one happened when I was 11. My grandparents were visiting and had their camper parked next to our house. My brother and sisters were out with them playing cards, my mom and dad were in their bed room and I was playing the piano in the living room . Behind me is a LARGE picture window looking out onto a neighbors field and beyond that is Warehouser land. As I was playing with my back turned to the window. I had a \"Someones watching me feeling\" I turned around and there, approximately 10 feet in front of me,watching me play piano, is this hairy creature. He was taller than the picture window because he was bending to see in. His arms were long, his eyes were reddish brown as was his hair. It became darker on his main body, but was lighter on his face and chest area. His upper body was pretty buff. It took me a while to scream as I was frozen in fear for a bit but when I did finally scream he took off. My dad ran out and saw the back of it running away. my grandparents and sisters in brother saw it run by the camper and then dad saw it run through our field to the creek.So that's 6 people that saw it. I of course, having the closest encounter.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness now lives in Montana.  I was able to talk with her over the phone on two occasions. The witness was 11 years-old when these encounters took place. She and her family lived in a rural area a few miles east of Chehalis, Washington. The family farm bordered Weyerhaeuser owned forest land.  There is a creek that is nearby called Lucas Creek.The witness' 1st encounter:  She was alone in the living room playing piano. The piano was arranged so that if sitting to play, your back is facing the large picture window. Her parents were in their bedroom. Her siblings were with their grandparents in the camper playing cards. She said that she was playing away, and then got that \u0093I am being watched\u0094 feeling. She turned around to see a sasquatch looking through the window at her. Her reaction was to just stare at it in shock for a moment, frozen with fear. Then, when she recovered she screamed. She remembers the creature making a sort of raised-eyebrow facial reaction in surprise in response to the scream. It then turned and ran off as her father came into the room.  Her father saw its back as it ran away.  It ran by the camper, and her grandparents and siblings also saw it run by. It ran upright on two legs.  She said that it had to run around or jump over the farm equipment and other items until it got to the pasture. It ran with a very heavy gait, supporting lots of weight. Once it was at the pasture, it really got going fast as it ran away. Creature description: She said that when she first turned and looked at it, it was standing on the ground, leaning forward, supporting itself with its two hands placed on the outside wall above the window. It was leaning forward with its head under the eaves of the house so that it could see her through the window. She described the creature as having very long arms. The hair was reddish-brown. It appeared to be 3-4 inches long, overall, but longer on the shoulders and head. There was a hint of ears, but hair was covering them. There was not much hair under its arms, and the hair was a lighter color in this region. There was hair all over the face and was not of uniform color, shaded light to dark. It was obviously male. It had wide shoulders. There was good definition over the waist and hips. From shoulders to waist it was \u0093V\u0094 shaped. She was impressed by how muscular and 'cut' it looked. She explained that physically, in retrospect, the bigfoot's appearance was very impressive. It did not look aggressive, and appeared to be shocked when she turned around and screamed. The head was longer than a human's head by proportion. It was wide at the forehead, and rectangular in shape with a wide jaw. The mouth was pronounced and a little ape-like. It was very hairy around the mouth. She did not see teeth. The top of the head was somewhat pointed towards the back. The eyes were a honey color or a brown-copper color. She saw no white in the eyes. The eyebrows \u0093scrunched\u0094 as it looked at her in surprise when she screamed. The face looked intelligent. The nose seemed like it was flatter than a human. Second encounter:  It came back the next summer. She believes it was the very same creature. The house had no air-conditioning, and it was hot, so she would put a mattress in the back of the truck and make that into her \u0093summer bedroom\u0094. She and her friend were sleeping in the back of her father's pickup truck when something caused them to awaken. What they saw was the creature looking in the side window at them. They were both awake, but frozen with fear. They held onto each other. It stood there looking in at them for 20-30 minutes while the two girls did not move a muscle. She said that they were both in pain from being immobile for so long. Then, the creature moved towards the open tailgate of the truck. She was afraid of what it would do and nearly passed out with fear, but it never showed itself there, as it moved off and left.As a young girl, she used to spend most of her free time playing along the creek and roaming around the woods. She would collect agates from the creek to sell to the rock collectors every summer at the gem show in town. She used that to make some money and became very good at grading the stones, knowing what they were worth and what the gem collectors were looking for. As such, she possibly became a familiar person to any sasquatches living in the area, and as a female child, would be an object of their curiosity and not a threat. Her brother and sister also played outdoors. This behavior on their part is exactly what would make a sasquatch interested in observing them. Also, the playing of music is an often reported activity that seems to interest sasquatches. This combination of being a female child playing in and roaming the wood as well as playing piano is a powerful enticement to the local sasquatches.I believe that this account of two encounters is authentic. Although this witness was only 11 and 12 at the times of the encounters, she remembers a lot of detail. Further, other family members also saw it. I asked to talk to other members of her family, and she said she would pass on my request, but they have not contacted me.I went to the location. The witness and her family have not lived there for 30 years. It was in very poor shape, and I did not feel safe walking up to the house. However, the forest environment around that area is still very conducive to sasquatch habitation.",
