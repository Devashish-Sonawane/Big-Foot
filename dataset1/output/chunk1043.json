            "Observed": "I was camping with my dad at Bear Lake in Emigrant National Wilderness. I had just woken up from a loud strange sound, I put my boots on and got out of the tent and heard a very loud howling noise comign from the top of the cliffs nearby. It was just a really loud howling sound almost like the sound a gorilla makes. But it lasted for about two hours. From 5am when the sun was just coming up til just before i ate breakfast, and that was around 7am. But during the course of this loud howling sound, what ever it had moved.. along the cliffs, I didn't see anything but I could tell the sound wasn't coming from where it was originally. The howling was echoing off the canyon walls, and it could be heard throughout the canyon, boy scouts had left very early that morning after they heard the sounds. There were many caves in the cliffs, the top of the cliff was about probably 8,000 ft, I was around 7,400 ft. What ever had been making the sounds I heard that morning eventually stopped and left the area I think, or I just didn't hear anything after that.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was camping with his father in a remote part of the Emigrant Wilderness. The area required a cross country hike in. There was one other group of Boy Scouts camped 75 yards away. The witness was awakened by the sound of \"howling whoops\" coming from the ridge line that overlooked the lake they were camped beside. The whoops were regular and steady over the course of two hours coming basically one every 3 minutes. He describes them as \"loud and from a very large animal\". The witness is self described as \"knowing what most animals in the woods sound like and this wasn't a bear, elk, deer, or anything else I've ever heard\". He and his father eventually spoke to the other campers who were spooked by the incident and decided to hike out of the area. ",
