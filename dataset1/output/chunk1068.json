The sounds sound like something screeming. But kind of high pitched screems. My friend also thought he heard somthing throwing stuff around his treestand. The reason I think it is a bigfoot is because there is some property behind ours, and they have been clearcuting all of it. I think it has run the bigfoot on to our property. If I see or hear any thing else I will send you more info, but from what I have already heard I think it is a bigfoot.",

During the discussion, he mentioned that he and his hunting partners have heard similar screams and roaring, usually in the early fall, through September of 2006. His theory is that the area is not used outside of deer hunting season and the intrusion of hunters disturbs whatever is in the area. As of last September, he was in the woods with others and heard something moving along the ridge above his position. He began to move toward the sound when he sensed that a stick had been thrown at him. As he continued to move toward the location of the sound, he heard whatever had been on the ridge move rapidly down the far side and away from him. He said whatever it was was moving fast and tearing through the brush. As the leaves were still on the trees, he did not see anything. He stated he was familiar with bobcat calls, owls, turkey, etc. and these sounds are like nothing he has heard in the woods typically.Walker County has a rich history of strange sounds and sightings. The area has many remote stands of mountains and forest including the Crockford-Pigeon Mountain WMA ,a section of the Chattahoochee National Forrest, the Tennessee Valley Divide and Lookout Mountain. The Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park is in Walker County and has a long documented, history of paranormal occurances. There are numerous creeks criss-crossing the gaps and low areas around the mountains as well as a cave system. Nickajack Lake and the Tennessee River are less than 75 miles away.",
