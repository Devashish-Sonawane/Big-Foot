            "Observed": "My brother and I were on backpacking trip in sometime in the mid 1980's. 1987, if my memory serves me correctly. We were hiking the High Sierra Trail from Bearpaw Meadow over the summit into the Kern River valley. We had made quite a distance the third day out (about 18 miles) and were exhausted when we stopped at a small lake called Morraine Lake high above the Kern River valley. We had seen no other hikers the entire day. As we were sitting in camp at dusk, the quiet was pierced by an unearthly screaming howl of immense volume, emanating from some distance away from us, but carrying quite clearly in the still air. It sounded as if it came from some animal with huge lung capacity, and could not be confused with human, a bear, or any other sound I had ever heard. The outburst only happened once and trailed off rather than stopping abruptly. Although clearly not human, it somehow seemed sad in tone rather than fierce or threatening.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Comments by Bobbie Short of Bobbie's California Sightings List Web Site:The witness remarks about the\"the normal geographic range for Bigfoot sightings,\" saying that \" .. the Sierra Mt. Range was not believed to be a typical Bigfoot area\" in California. The witness is correct here only to the extent that many Americans have come to associate the Pacific Northwest with bigfoot sightings and related incidents. Many documentaries and articles have highlighted this region as the classic bigfoot territory. The fact is these same kinds of sightings and incidents are reported from dozens of contiguous rural and mountainous regions across the United States and Canada.Comments by Matt Moneymaker of BFRO:In the Pacific region, the Pacific Northwest Cascade Range flows to the south, through Oregon, into Northern California, and down to the Mt. Shasta region, where the Sierra Nevada Range picks up. The Sierras connect to ranges in Southern California which run southward to the Mexican Sierra Madres. There are MANY reports both old and new throughout the entire Sierra Nevada Range, including the mountainous section of Kern County, and as far south as San Diego County on the Mexican border. Much of the activity in the southern mountains occurs on the uninhabited eastern slopes of these mountains facing the deserts.",
