            "Observed": "Shortly after laying down for the night during a backpacking trip in the Nantahala Wilderness, we heard a howl that lasted 10-15 seconds, with a change of tone for the last few seconds. This howl could not have been mistaken for any other animal and sounded very similar to recordings of other howls. In the next 2 hours we both heard random whoops also.  The next day while hiking we came across several very interesting signs along the trail. The first was spotting what looked like a game trail that crossed the hiking trail. Upon closer inspection, the tracks in the well traveled trail clearly were not made by bear or any other four legged animal.  The footprints on the trail had left deep impressions where the heel contacted the ground and footprints much larger than my foot were also seen.  The distance between the tracks was approximately 5 feet on average and the depth of the tracks where the heel had sunk down was 3 plus inches.   The ferns and weeds in the trail that had been pressed down were still green and flat which made me think the tracks had been made within the past couple of days. I followed the trail in both directions for approximately 150 yards and the footprints remained consistent in both directions.  After traveling the hiking trail further down the ridgeline for close to mile I spotted another trail that crossed the hiking trail. The footprints here were identical to what we saw at the first trail. I took pictures to gauge the depth and length of the prints.  I found a stick on this trail that had blood on it.  I regret not keeping it for evidence to see what type of blood it was.  The location of both trails had some similarities: both were located in gaps along the ridgeline and there was an unusually high amount of limbs and trees wedged in tree forks at both sites.  One other strange observation made along the trail was finding 3 large white mushrooms placed upside down near the trails. One of these was on a rock and another was found on the trail while following the footprints.  The area where we found these signs was the direction where we had heard the howl the night before.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have talked with the witness on the phone and by email numerous times about his report. I have found him to be a very credible and informative witness.  The witness and a friend were doing some hiking on the Appalachian Trail near Standing Indian area in the Nantahala National Forest in Macon County. They had camped for the night near the Carter Gap on the AT. Around Midnight they heard a very distinct howl that was loud and lasted for 10-15 seconds. He stated the howl had a very distinct \"two tone\" sound to it. He knew of no animal that could make this sound. Later that night they heard \"whoop\" calls from the distance in the same direction. The witness stated the howl was very clear but was over a mile away. \"Whatever it was it was very large\".  The whoops were somewhat closer in range and about an hour later.  I directed the witness to listen to the 1994 Ohio Moaning Howl and also to the Sound Cloud site for Mononga Hela which has many different recordings of possible Sasquatch sounds. He selected the Decatur Ga 2012 howl Decatur GA 2012 Howl and the Ohio Moaning Howl as the ones it sounded more like. BFRO Report 28982 explains where the Decatur howl came from.  The link provided here is actually two recordings put together. The first part is Mononga Hela's original recording, and the second part is a better recording captured by Investigator Gudrun Hrizuk, about 9 months after MH's recording was made. Together they make a much better case. This witness was very forward in saying that the howl he heard had a \"two toned\" sound to it.  The next morning they packed up and continued their hike on the AT. His hiking friend had a problem with a boot, the heel had came apart. So they decided to take a short cut and go down the Lower Ridge trail to the Standing Indian Campground. It was down this trail, in rather large weeds and ferns, that they discovered where something large had crossed the trail. They then discovered the large tracks/trail in two separate areas. He stated the tracks were very deep in the leaf matter and that they were larger than his size 13 boot.  He was able to follow them for a very good distance and the stride length was an estimated 5 foot in distance.  He took these photos, the compass is showing the depth.  He also stated that they found 3 large mushrooms \"picked\" and placed beside the trail. These mushrooms had no bite marks what so ever.  He did not think to mark the area with some kind of marker and did not have a GPS. Both of them realized,  that the howl they heard the night before was in the direction of the Lower Ridge trail area.  On July 7th, I hiked to this very remote area. Although I did not find his exact location due to a storm coming in,  I did observe the following:  Very high weeds, large ferns, two possible tracks and a tree break.  This area is a very rich area and it was very easy to see where something had went across the trail.  I found this very interesting track about 12-13 inches long, the map is 11 inches long:Also, I found this possible tree break/twist that was directly across the trail. It was clearly blocking the main Lower Ridge Trail. The witness did not remember this at all when they went down the trail. My visit was cut short by a very hard summer storm.  This is a rich area, full of mushrooms, beech and oak trees. The witness is very knowledgeable in the outdoors. He has a good knowledge of wildlife and was very to the point that what they heard was not coyotes or any known animal. He has many wild animals on his farm and has never heard this before.  This report could possibly be related to BFRO Report 50721. This report was filed by this investigator as a roadside Class A sighting located some 6-7 miles away from this location. I find this to be much more than a coincidence. ",

            "Observed": "Me and my wife and two girls were going to see my parents who live in Cleburne county AL and my daughter who had not long gotten her drivers license was driving and I was up front in the passenger seat and my wife and other daughter was in the back. We had just gotten of the interstate and had turned down the long back road that takes us to my parents . And as we came over a hill and something huge and black darted across the road on two feet and into the woods about 50 yards ahead . My daughter said what was that I was like I have no idea , it was massive and very wide across the shoulders and it\u0092s head seemed to just sit on top of its huge shoulders, like this thing was taller and wider than anything I\u0092ve ever seen and moved with unreal speed . My daughter didn\u0092t really get a good of look at it she just seen something big zip across the road , but I seen it long enough to see it was standing up on two feet and really big and I guess what stands out to me the most is just how wide it\u0092s upper body was  big enough to know that no other animal could even come close especially around here, and it\u0092s height I\u0092m just guessing but it seemed easily 8 feet  . I still can\u0092t believe that something like this actually exist I mean how can something that big not be seen more ,you hear the stories but to see something like this that you can\u0092t explain, and you know most people will not believe you but I guess now I\u0092m a believer",

Both he and his daughter saw the sasquatch briefly as it ran across the road approx 50 yards in front of the car in full daylight. There is dense forest on both sides of the road so ithe sighting didn\u0092t last long. However iit was long enough for the father to be certain that the large, top heavy figure was running on two legs and its fur was brown iand it roughly 8 feet tall. He said it was definitely not a bear.The daughter only noticed something big quickly crossing the road but wasn\u0092t focused on it like the father. Here is the location near Abernathy:",
