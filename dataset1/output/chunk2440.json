            "Observed": "My name is Kevin and I've been hunting in Alaska for 8 years now. I'm used to tracking dangerous animals like Bull Moose and Grizzly Bears. One early morning we were observing several Large Moose tracks in the mud. I saw a track that looked like a BIG FOOT track. I looked at my buddy and said \"what does that look like to you\"? and He said \"That's a Big Foot track\"! there it was amongst the moose tracks. It was a good 11 inches long and was made from the right foot. I could see all 5 toes. What struck me most was the size of the big toe! The track appeared to be a couple of days old. I looked around for other tracks, but found none. The thing must of been running. I wanted to go back there and make a plaster cast, but it was raining hard. Two days later I went back there and the track was filled with water and nonrecognizable.",

            "Observed": "I saw a shadow of a beast, about 50 feet away from the edge of the field.... It was around 9:47pm and a few people went away from our camp fire to an open field to see the milky way. A dense fog had appeared over the higher field flowers and tall grass behind our camp site. As we were gazing up, I took time quietly to assess the landscape just under and to the left of my view of the big dipper, and over the fog in the open field. My eyes had adjusted to the night and a shadowy figure of a huge being started to appear. It was dark against the fog. It was in the middle of the field and looked to be standing, leaning forward on its left leg. There were no trees casting a shadow, there were no lights to cast a shadow. It gives me goosebumps to explain it. I was alarmed but was afraid that my friends were playing a joke on me, because it was my first time at the farm, to camp with them. I have been camping before and nothing has ever scared me other than spiders. I tried to point out what I was seeing. I didn't yell, but firmly asked people to look at that and ask what is that?. But they couldn't see what I was pointing at. It seemed that nobody was paying attention to me. At that time I decided to leave the group and head back to the fire out of my own fear and wanting to feel safe. They followed me, I felt a little bad I left my friends but they didn't seem alarmed and were actually wanting an encounter. We sat by the fire and heard coyotes howling, for about 5 minutes then they abruptly stopped. I was afraid to go to bed until my tent buddy went with me. I kept my feelings to myself because I didn't want to the butt of a joke, but I know what I saw.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone.  I found her to be credible.  I have been to the property on a previous occasion with other investigators.  The previous report from this area did not happen at this location.  The following can be added to this report.  The night before, the group was having fun attempting Bigfoot vocalizations.  They were not expecting anything to happen. The group on the night of this incident was looking at the stars, and they were facing to the north, northwest.  Off to the west there is a series of low hills that border the property.  The area has a small stream running nearby and farms are close by. As this was happening, the rest of the group continued to star gaze and really did not pay her any attention.  She was about ten feet from the group and was to afraid to move much as the animal was not moving either.  The witness did have a dog with her as she was carrying it.  It did not react to the animal as she was holding it.  She did not go back to the area in the morning to look for any further evidence of the watcher.  She was so startled that she left the camp torches lit all night and would not leave the camp area to go to the bathroom.  She estimates that the animal was about forty feet from her in the taller grass.  It did not move and only seemed to be observing them.  The grass was approximately five feet high and the torso stood about two to three feet higher than that.  She did see shoulders and a head.  The head was round and it was broad in the shoulders, it was facing her.  She did not notice a neck.  There was no smell nor did the animal make any sounds. She had the impression that it was leaning forward on one leg.  The shadow of the animal was more pronounced because of the fog and made the shadow stand out to her. Sketch done by the witness:Location where the figure was seen:This encounter lasted about seven minutes, until she decided to leave, and head back to camp.  The group consisted of six people including the witness.  When the witness left the area, the rest of the group went back to camp.  She went to bed two hours later and she was uncomfortable in the tent until her tent mate came into the tent.  Nothing else happened the rest of the night and her dog did not show any signs of distress.  Labeling this as a class B because of the conditions the animal was seen.Exact location not plotted because it is private property.",
