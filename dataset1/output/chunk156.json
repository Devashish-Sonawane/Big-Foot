Thanks to your website I have been able to concentrate much of my attention on Oklahoma, since it has many more reports than my native Kansas, which has not been updated. On that note, myself and some other interested participants traveled to Leflore County in SE Oklahoma in an attempt to find some evidence, since this area is a hotspot of reported activity.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.The witness stated that the footprints measured sixteen inches long by six inches wide.  He was most impressed by the fact that the animal maintained a distance between steps  of five and a half feet while going up a very steep slope.  The witness provided photos that he took of the footprints but they are not of enough detail to be published.",
