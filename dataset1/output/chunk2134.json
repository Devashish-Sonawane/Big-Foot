            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness on the 25th of August.  His estimation of the height of the creature was six and a half feet to possibly seven feet tall. Its hands could be seen as it pulled itself up from a crouched position.  It  had places where the hair was longer....the boys were very nervous upon looking upon it.  It was described as V-shaped in the torso and well built in the arms. When the light from the video camera was flipped on, I was told that the reflection from its eyes was red.   Initially his parents did not believe him but do now.  However, he felt the police did not.       It was viewed from approximately 80 feet away and the bottom half of it was obscured by the bushes.  It also had a big heavy squarish head.  He thought it was dark in color and would have been able to tell if it was a light color.  His question to me was why was he in a swamp ???   We both agreed that not many people go there.  Continued investigation regarding the sighting is planned.",
