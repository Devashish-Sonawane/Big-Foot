            "Observed": "I was sitting in a deer stand (box 12 foot high on stilts) about 0530 AM. In Randolph county, GA on my grandfather's land.  I climbed up and it was still dark out, about 30 degrees.  About 30 minutes after climbing in the stand and settling down I noticed a musty, dank smell, kind of like a wild hog that's been in a wallow, but really swampy.  It kept getting stronger and keep in mind I'm about 100 yards off a dirt road in the woods.  I saw something about 7.5 - 8' tall step out from behind a tree, swaying back and forth looking at me from either side of the tree. I reached for my gun, and when I looked back up it was gone. I didn't see any tracks when I looked after I got out, I've never hunted that stand since Thanksgiving 2011.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone, and he was still adamant he would not hunt that area again. The land consists of 300 acres of pine forest, creeks and a pond. It is only accessible by a dirt road, and 12 miles from town.  Very few people venture on to this property, making it a great place to hunt deer and turkey. The witness arrived well before sunrise. He climbed into the wooden structure that serves as a raised platform 12ft off the ground. With this view, he can see further into the forest (most trees are bare of leaves by this time) and keep his scent to a minimum. He passed the time by texting short messages to friends. About 30 mins. he noticed the musky odor that reminded him of a wet dog, and figured it might be a wild hog. Then he caught movement out the corner of his vision about 25 yards away, and as his eyes adjusted to the figure, it appeared to be a huge, hairy animal that was standing behind a very large tree. This animal was described as standing on two legs, covered in brown/grayish hair, and appeared to have moss hanging on it. As is stood there observing our witness, it was swaying from one side of the tree to the other and emitting short, low grunts. It was between 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall, with one leg and foot sticking out from behind the tree. The witness then reached for his gun with the scope to get a closer look, and as he took his eyes off the creature he could hear it walking through the forest. When he looked back up 2 seconds later, it was gone. He waited till noon to leave the stand to be sure it was out of the area. He spoke with a few friends and his Grandfather, but no one else had ever seen or heard anything similar on the property.",

            "Observed": "A friend and I were fishing on Holt lake in tuscaloosa county on day after work.  It was a thursday about mid july of last year (1999).  We had gotten on the water about 6:30 and started fishing.  We put in at Rocky Branch and went up river towards the upper end lock.  Towards night fall we started fishing back toward the launch.  about 11:30 we were fishing a secluded part of the shoreline.  The nearest house was probably 2-3 miles down river.  We were fishing close to the bank when I heard something walking at the top of the hill.  I figured it was a deer and didn't pay it any more attention.  As we proceeded down the bank the sound started down the hill towards us.  There were two distinct foot steps instead of four like a deer.  I thought I was hearing things so I looked back at my buddy and he was looking up the hill towards the sound.  We decided to go look for another fishing spot (because we were getting a little spooked)and started putting everthing up to make our run.  As we were doing that, whatever it was broke into a run towards us.  Before we could get the boat cranked the creature let out the most herendous snarl and growl I had ever heardand then hit the water after us.  We both love to hunt and spend alot of time outdoors but neither of us had ever heard anything like that, nor could we duplicate it when we would tell people of our encounter.  I hadn't thought anything else about it until we got on this web site and heard the recording of the growl sound.  That was the closest thing I have heard to the sound we heard that night.  I'v read that usually there is a strong musty smell preceeding most encounters, but we didnt smell anything unusual. Perhaps this was due to the fact that we were in a cross wind with the creature.  We don't know exactly what it was because we havent gotten up the nerve to go back and look around.  That was probably the last time I have been on the lake.  Everyone we told about this said we were crazy and were hearing things, but none of them will go back with me at night to look for it.  Due to the pale color of my face when I got home about 45min-1hrs later, my girlfriend will not even go the lake.  Its about 30min off of HWY59 exit 100 in brookwood Al.",
