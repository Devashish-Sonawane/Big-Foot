We came into a swamp-like area and heard some twigs snap and smelled this awful smell and saw something moving in the trees ahead.The creature was dark,hairy,grollia-like,and it was walking on to legs, it stopped for a moment and looked around then we ran out of the place. Later my conseuer told us it was just a bear but bears aren't usally in a swamp or walk on to legs.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke  with the witness and her father. On July 11th, 2000, while on a hike during summer camp, a group of approxmately ten girls observed in a clearing a large bipedal, black creature. They observed such, for approximately 1 - 2 minutes, from a distance of approximately 100 yards. When one of the young girls screamed, it stopped and looked at them. They immediately fled the area. She was instructed by the counselor as were all the other children, that what they had seen was a bear. However witness pointed out that the creature did not have ears like a bear, but rather the ears could not be seen.  It is also unlikely that this was a bear because they observed it over a minute and observed it walk some distance on two legs. It is my hypothesis that the counselor was saying this to quell any \"monster\" stories back at the camp and prevent panic.The witness is extremely convincing, and upon speaking with her father, stated that she has steadfastly, stuck to with what she saw.",
