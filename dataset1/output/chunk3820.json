            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness was on a church outing for two days.  He remembers watching the horizon and the jagged peaks, he was located away from the main group to be alone to watch the goats on the other side of the valley, rolling over and then turning back over to see that the peaks he noticed earlier were now rounded.  This time the horizon was moving back and forth, causing almost a feeling of nausea for him.He said the silhouette had been watching for more than two minutes, then walked away from him.  He later heard the other kids saying something about seeing a gorilla or monkey and that it was walking away from them.  The adults, one them the pastor, told them to quiet down, that they shouldn't try to scare the other kids.The next morning none of the adults believed the children, and they continued on down the trail and returned to the camping area.  Nothing came around the camping area the next night nor did he notice anything else out of the ordinary.  The campers were kept closer to each other because of the ruckus the night before.  There were no tents pitched for that camping trip.  Everyone was under the night sky in sleeping bags.Two campfires were going that night and the one near the witness was dying out and so no other light than the evening stars. Out of the fifteen children on the trip, nine of them witnessed a biped walking away from the camp.",
