            "Follow-Up Report": "The witnesses in this string of sightings all appear to be credible. The evidence and the environment provide every reason to believe that these were valid sightings of the Skunk Ape (Bigfoot) creature. There is speculation that this rash of sightings may have been more than one creature moving out of the dense swamp, toward  dry ground, due to the extreme environment this year.FURTHER INFORMATION:  Future updates will be  provided and reports of any future activity. This area has a long history of sightings. Seminole indians, in the area, advise that the creatures have lived in the swamps for many years and that they should be left  in peace. They also advise that they are not bothered by the creatures but fear that disturbing the creatures may result in the infliction of their wrath. All research, regarding these reports, is being conducted by members of the BFRO and through the BFRO. =============================================MEDIA PRINT: July 23rd, 1997, News Press, Fort-Meyers Florida Everglades residents report sightings of Skunk Ape OCHOPEE, Fla. -- (AP) -- The splash next to the lily pads in the swamp might be a Florida soft shell turtle sliding off a log into the water. The rustling in the bushes could be an alligator, bear or snake -- or something else. That's what a half-dozen tourists, swamp tour operators and the Ochopee fire chief said last week as they reported sightings of a large, furry, black creature. Tales of a skunk ape, also known as swamp ape and Bigfoot, have circulated around the Big Cypress National Preserve and the Everglades for generations. Decades ago, the community staged an annual skunk ape festival, and longtime residents have numerous tales of the smelly creature they say lurks in the swamp. ``I don't know if it's somebody playing a game or what,'' said Vince Doerr, fire chief in the Everglades hamlet. He said he saw something large and hairy running across Burns Road on two legs Monday. ``I know a lot of old timers that used to be serious about it,'' Doerr told the News-Press in Fort Myers for today's editions. ``I just think someone's playing games. I just looked at it and laughed.'' Dow Roland, a tour guide for Everglades Day Safari, said he was on Turner River Road Friday when some boys in his tour group started shouting that they saw Bigfoot. ``About 100 yards away a creature came out,'' Roland said. ``It looked like Bigfoot or someone in a big gorilla suit. Roland said it wouldn't be wise to dress up like a gorilla and play skunk ape because the outfit would be extremely hot, the work environment filled with bugs-- and the prankster could be shot. The Big Cypress National Preserve received a couple of Bigfoot reports from tourists recently, but officials didn't take them too seriously. ``I think somebody's playing a trick at the tourists' expense,'' said Ron Clark, chief of natural resources at the park. ``If an animal like that existed for as many years as people have been studying the swamp, it would have been found. I hardly believe something like that would go unnoticed.'' But longtime residents of the remote, rural community say the creature has been around for generations. ``I believe that there's something out there,'' said David Shealy, owner of the Florida Panther Gift Shop and Big Cypress Trail Lakes Campground. ``And it's been around now for a long time, but it's been hidden.'' Shealy, 33, believes the mosquitoes, which are especially bad this year, are flushing the skunk ape out of the swamp and onto the roads. Shealy said he saw what he believes was the skunk ape when he was a young boy hunting with his brother. He also grew up listening to skunk ape stories. ``The Indians woke up in the middle of the night when they heard a horrible noise,'' Shealy said, relating one tale. ``They saw him ripping up their camp. ... His eyes glowed red.'' Legend has the skunk ape smelling like a combination of rotten eggs, moldy cheese and goat dung. ``It smelled that bad because it spends most of its time underground in alligator caves,'' Shealy said. Fire chief Doerr and Pelican Tours operator Steve Goodbread, who also recently spotted a hairy creature, are almost embarrassed to discuss what they saw. ``It just looked like something that didn't look human. It was big and black, but it didn't look like a bear,'' Goodbread said. But Goodbread added he doesn't want the creature associated with his tour because he wants his tour's reputation to be about viewing nature not ``something hokey.'' Shealy isn't ashamed to talk about or believe in the skunk ape. ``There's no mystery left in the world anymore,'' he said. ``We've become so smart as a civilization that we tend to discount things not based on facts. People like mysteries.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Published Monday, July 28, 1997, in the Miami Herald Mysterious `ape' raising a big stink By CYRIL T. ZANESKI and Susan Cocking OCHOPEE -- Someone -- or something -- was lurking in the dark, mysterious swamp just a few steps away from the old gravel road in the heart of cypress stands about 40 miles west of Miami. A small group of British tourists and their tour guide swear to that.  They reported seeing the hulking, ape-like creature lurking one afternoon last week behind a veil of Spanish moss that drips from the towering cypress trees at the swampy edges of Turner River Road. Could it be . . . the skunk ape? That's right, the skunk ape. Florida's Bigfoot, the Sasquatch of the Swamp, the Abominable Snowman of the subtropics, the Yeti of the Glades. A distant cousin of the more famous apemen of the northlands, the skunk ape's reported description usually closely follows those of its primitive relatives: about seven feet tall, flat-faced, broad-shouldered, covered with long hair or fur and -- of course -- reeking of skunk. In recent weeks, several people have phoned in reports of creatures that fit that description to officials at Big Cypress National Preserve. The reports were believed o be the first since a flurry of skunk ape sightings in Southeast Florida 20 years ago. Vince Doerr, chief of the Ochopee Fire Control District, saw a strange creature cross Burns Road near his home last Monday morning. ``I was riding along when, 800 feet ahead of me, a brown-looking tall thing ran across the road,'' Doerr said. ``It wasn't a bear -- that's for sure. It ran into the woods.'' Doerr said he grabbed his camera and snapped away, but he thinks the creature was too far away for a good shot. He hasn't developed the film yet. Another tourist attraction There were also reports from tour operators who travel one of South Florida's best places to see wildlife -- Turner River Road. The unpaved state highway cuts through a slough crowded with bald cypress trees laden with Spanish moss and spidery air plants. Dow Rowland, 54, a guide for Everglades Day Safari, said he was hauling six British tourists up Turner River Road last week when they spotted the apeman loping along the cypress trees on the west side of the road, about two miles north of Tamiami Trail. ``It was about six feet tall with brown, long fur,'' Rowland said. ``It loped along like a big monkey or a gorilla, then it disappeared into the woods.'' Big guy gets around Rowland said his group was not the first to see the apeman this summer.  ``There was a sighting from the Naples Trolley Tour out of Marco Island,'' Rowland said. ``That driver was really shook up.'' David Shealy, 33, owner of Florida Panther Gift Shop on Tamaimi Trail here, has a theory about why the skunk ape has shown itself lately.  ``The mosquitoes have been so bad this year that they probably ran the skunk ape out of the mangroves,'' said Shealy, who claims to have seen the ape at a distance many years ago and sees its large, mushy footprints in the mud during hunting seasons. Maybe it's a conspiracy The tales go back decades in South Florida. ``There were rumors in the 1960s of a Bigfoot or a really large skunk ape being held by the armed services at . . . Everglades National Park,'' wildlife biologist George Dalrymple said. The ape escaped by ramming itself through a concrete block wall, as the story went Some investigators made plaster casts of its prints, but those casts are top secret, probably locked away in federal vaults, Dalrymple said with a sly wink. Sightings of the skunk ape were most frequent in the 1970s in the wake of 1967 film that allegedly showed Bigfoot strolling the California woods and a flurry of news reports of Sasquatch sightings in the Pacific Northwest. Not coincidentally, this was also the time in Southeast Florida when developers were working their way west  into the Everglades, bringing newcomers -- suburbanites -- into close contact with country folks who spent their weekends at hunting or fishing camps in the marshes. ``Back when everybody had camps out there, people would come to town with stories,'' said J.A. Wasilewski, a biologist who once worked at Everglades Holiday Park, the airboating and fishing stop on U.S. 27 in western Broward. ``People were seeing shadowy things, but that was usually after a couple six-packs of Bud out there in the swamp. Endangered habitat The stories have faded as the marshes and the camps have disappeared under suburban pavements. The sightings in the untamed swamps now being reported in Southwest Florida, which is now experiencing a housing development and tourism boom of its own. Richard Greenwell, secretary of the International Society of Cryptozoology in Tuscon, Ariz., a group that investigates reported sightings of animals unknown to science, expects there'll always be reports of sightings of strange creatures somewhere. ``We live in a world where everything is structured by technology and predictable things,'' Greenwell said. ``People like to know that in this modern, humdrum world, there still unknown places. Still places wild enough to harbor animals still unknown to science.'' Send the suit to the cleaners To be sure, not everyone is curious. Ron Clark, leader of Big Cypress' resource management team, said the preserve doesn't investigate skunk ape sightings. ``I think we're safe in assuming that there are probably no previously unclassified primates roaming the Big Cypress,'' Clark said. ``We think somebody's playing a prank on our tourists.'' Doerr and Rowland both believe what they saw was probably a man in a gorilla suit. ``If I thought it was real, I would have run in there, beat it to death and sold it to the National Enquirer,'' Doerr said. ``I think it's just somebody playing games.'' =============================================Witness Information:  (#1) Steve Goodbread, (#2) Dow Roland, (#3) Jan Brock, (#4) Vince Doerr, (#5) David Shealy and (#6) CONFIDENTIAL ",
