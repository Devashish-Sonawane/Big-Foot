            "Follow-Up Report": "After several emails, phone calls, and email photos, I met with the witness at his home where he has resided for the last 8 years. All of his photos were taken with a basic low resolution infrared night vision camera at fairly long distances. None were clear enough to be reasonably assured that they were of a bigfoot, however most did appear to be man shaped. The likelihood that they were of a human is very remote. I observed nothing that would suggest that they were a hoax. Here is one of the better photos with an unknown figure, taken with night vision:The witness\u0092 property includes his house, a small forested area to the north and east with a large sunken pond bordered by trees. Much of the pond is visible down the hill from his back yard. After he showed me in daylight, from his back yard, the area of the pond where most of his sightings have taken place, the witness drove me to a remote cemetery, where he said he and neighbors had seen something large prowling at night. While we were there, we walked the 1/4 mile into the cemetery and did flush several wild turkeys that ran through the cemetery. Outside the cemetery perimeter fence on the southwest, a mesquite forest ran down to a thickly forested creek bottom. From there, we took a series of back roads to see what the other terrain in the area is like. The witness\u0092 property is just 5 miles west of the Red River, which contains lots of uninhabited floodplain land. Most of the intervening land is cropland and pasture but with several small ponds and wooded areas.After returning to his home, the witness, his dog, and I did a night recon around part of the lake. We did not see or hear anything unusual. After returning to his yard, the witness told me about other incidents on the property. One occurred while he was doing maintenance after dark near a perimeter fence. After hearing a whistle behind him to the north and looking in that direction, something very large broke cover within a few feet of his position to the south and ran to the east in tall grass by the perimeter fence. Because it was dark, the witness could not see any details of the animal but said that is was very large and fast and did not move like any known animal. I found the witness to be forthright and sincerely concerned about having the possibility of bigfoots on his property. We discussed some do\u0092s and don\u0092ts in case he is visited in the future. He thanked me for coming and said that he felt much less apprehensive after our meeting. I suggested that he try to do motion filming rather than snapshots so that we can verify that what he is filming is alive. ",
