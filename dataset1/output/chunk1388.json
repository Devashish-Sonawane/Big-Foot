            "Follow-Up Report": "This sighting was near the border between Warren and Franklin counties.  The forest consists of mixed hardwoods, including oaks, gums, and poplars.  The terrain is hilly and has numerous creeks that branch off of Shocco Creek.  The witness remarked that the area provides ideal cover for eastern white-tailed deer.The witness was hunting during the week with a friend, but was alone for the first part of the morning while the hunting partner handled some personal business in town.   The camp was set up on one side of a fairly heavily traveled road.At approximately 9:00 AM, the witness was getting ready to leave camp and go into the woods.  The weather was clear and warm for mid-November.  Most of the leaves had already fallen from the trees.The witness noticed a large number of deer on the other side of the road headed in his direction.  He crossed the road, wondering if he might have an early opportunity or if the deer would run away from him.  The deer changed direction and ran parallel to the road.The witness then went into the woods, descending on a logging path down a hill to a creek that feeds into Shocco Creek.  He planned to hunt in the morning and head back for lunch.  The logging path crossed the creek with large patches of tall reeds at the bottom (i.e. river cane).  As the witness crossed the creek, a bedded deer hidden in the reeds jumped from its hiding place and ran away.  The witness could not see the deer, so he ran to higher ground to get a better view of the deer.When the witness was above the reeds, he could see the deer intermittently as it quickly moved off.  Across the creek, he saw something large that appeared to be a man dressed in brown clothes wearing a backpack.  The observed subject then turned its head and looked over its right shoulder at the witness.  The witness was stunned when he realized he was not looking at another hunter.  The animal then swung its head forward and moved through the forest \u0093to put distance between us.  It was swift and determined.\u0094The witness then returned to the camp to see if his friend had returned, or if any other hunters had parked in the immediate area.  He saw no other vehicles.  The witness remarked that any other hunters parked on another road would have hiked two or three miles through dense hardwood forest to reach the creek.Having no way to contact his hunting partner and not wishing to stay at the camp, the witness decided he would leave and go to a cutover to increase his field of view.  He returned to camp once he knew his hunting partner would have returned.The witness saw the creature at a distance of approximately 50 yards for six to eight seconds.  He could see the head, shoulders, and part of the chest.  The creature appeared to be standing upright and eight feet tall.  The witness estimated the creature weighed 600 to 800 lbs.  Gender could not be determined.  The hair looked brownish with patches of drab olive green.  The animal appeared to have a hump on its neck.  It had a perplexed or uncomfortable expression when it looked at the witness.  In hindsight, the witness wondered if the animal could have been stalking the deer.There are black bears in northern Warren County, but there was no resident population in the county at the time of the sighting.  The southern part of Warren is considered unoccupied range by the NC Wildlife Resources Commission, and there are no verified sightings of black bears in this part of the county from 1971 through 2001.  I asked the witness if this could be a bear.  He said that bears do not stand on their hind legs.  He also commented that he saw no snout or ears.  The face of the creature was flat.Other friends and family have hinted at seeing unexplained animals in the area when prompted, but they would never elaborate.I found the witness to be very credible.",

ON OUR WAY UP HE TOLD US OF AN ENCOUNTER HE HAD A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHILE CAMPING WITH SOME FRIENDS OUT IN THE WOODS.  THEY HAD JUST CAME BACK FROM TOWN AND WERE SITTING AROUND A CAMPFIRE WHEN SOMETHING STARTED YELLING AND RUSTLING AROUND IN THE WOODS IT WAS MOVING AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THEIR CAMPSITE THEY ENDED UP LEAVING AND NEVER WENT BACK FOR THEIR TENT OR CAMPING SUPPLIES.  WE DECIDED TO HEAD TO THE SAME AREA HE HAD CAMPED AT YEARS EARLIER.  THE DIRT ROAD THAT LED BACK INTO THE WOODS WAS VERY RUGGED AND IT TOOK US ABOUT 15 TO 20 MINUTES TO REACH THE AREA.  THERE WAS A CLEARING IN THE WOODS WHERE WE PARKED AND WE WALKED AROUND LOOKING FOR A GOOD AREA TO CAMP.  WE MADE A FIRE PIT AND PICKED FIDEL HEAD FERNS TO LAY OUR SLEEPING BAGS ON TOP OF.  LATER THAT NIGHT PROBABLY AROUND 2 OR 3 MY FRIEND WOKE US UP AND SAID THERE IS SOMETHING OUT IN THE WOODS WALKING AROUND OUR CAMP AREA, MY STEP BROTHER AND ME TOLD HIM IT WAS JUST HIS IMAGINATION AND GO BACK TO SLEEP.  AROUND 5 HE WOKE US UP AGAIN AND SAID GUYS THERE IS REALLY SOMETHING OUT THERE SO WE LISTENED AND WE HEARD SOMETHING MESSING WITH MY STEP BROTHERS CAR.  WE DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL THE SUN CAME UP TO GO INVESTIGATE.  WE GOT UP AND HEADED TO THE CAR ABOUT 30 YARDS OUT FROM OUR CAMPSITE WE NOTICED THAT SOMETHING HAD MADE A PATH THROUGH THE FIDEL HEAD FERNS AND IT ENCIRCLED OUR CAMPSITE THESE FERNS WERE THIGH HIGH AND LOOKED AS IF SOMEONE HAD BEEN WALKING ON THEM ALL NIGHT, VERY WEIRD.  WHEN WE GOT TO THE CAR EVERYTHING LOOKED ALRIGHT SO WE DECIDED TO LOOK AROUND THE AREA AND THAT IS WHEN WE FOUND A HUGE FOOTPRINT ON THE DIRT ROAD (IT WAS A SANDY AREA) AROUND SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN INCHES LONG ABOUT 7 INCHES ACROSS AND IT LEFT A DEEP IMPRESSION, WE WERE LIKE BIGFOOT.  WE WERE PRETTY FREAKED OUT AND KIND OF IN SHOCK FOR A FEW MINUTES.  WE LOOKED AROUND SOME MORE AND FOUND ANOTHER FOOTPRINT BY THE CREEK.  I BELIEVE TO THIS DAY THAT IT WAS A BIGFOOT THAT WE HAD ENCOUNTERED THAT NIGHT.  I HAVE TOLD THIS STORY TO MANY PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS AND I GET A CHILL DOWN MY BACK EVERY TIME.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "     On 7/7/2011 I spoke by phone with the witness. He is now stationed in the Air Force in southern Michigan. He recounted the night's events and restated that his step brother had had an earlier experience in the same area.  The friend who was camping with him woke everyone up during the night stating that there was something moving around outside of their campsite. They told him to go back to sleep. A couple hours later he woke everyone up again and the witness stated that they all heard something messing around with his step brother's vehicle. The sound of the vehicle suspension and springs moving up and down were clearly heard at that time. They waited until daylight to investigate.       About twenty yards before reaching the vehicle, they found a large footprint in the sand in the trail. He stated it was around seventeen inches long and very wide. Nothing seemed damaged with the vehicle. After looking around further, they found a couple more matching footprints in a creek bed that was about fifty yards from where they were camped. They left and camped the next night at a location a short distance away with no further incidents.    I found the witness to be honest and articulate in his recounting of his experience. He only heard noises and found footprints, but it seems likely that he and his friends had a late night encounter with a sasquatch who was curious about their vehicle and them in general. In his initial narrative, the witness stated he found a footprint at the car and one more at a creek bed. Upon talking at length with him, he stated he remembers the print in the trail before reaching the car and actually finding two prints at the creek bed, beside the creek.   The area of the encounter is heavily wooded with lots of wildlife, including deer, bear, numerous small game and the occasional cougar. This is the Pere Marquette State Forest and offers numerous small lakes and streams. Lake Michigan is just to the west. ",
