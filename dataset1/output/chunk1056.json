            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness by phone for an hour.   The next day, the witness and I went to the site where he and his family had the sighting.  Based on the witnesses\u0092 answers to my questions, and my survey of the sighting location, I am convinced that they had a class A encounter.  The creature was witnessed by the father, mother and child.The river can not be directly seen from the road. The family rode down the logging road between a half and a full mile.  They spent some time target shooting.  In the late afternoon, they headed back towards their vehicle.  It was a sunny day, and the sun was low on the western horizon.  When they reached a spot right at the 180 degree turn back to the main road, they stopped to look at the river at the one place where the river is in view from the road.  It was then when they saw the creature.  It was described as looking like a man in a trench coat.  It was black with hair about 4-6 inches long.  From what I observed of the site, the creature could not have been more than 100-150 yards from the family.  The witness stated that when he thought, \"What the heck is that?\" at that instant, the creature turned its head and locked eyes on them.  With the sun in the face of the creature, the witness stated that the eyes shown brightly.  He said that he had a feeling of intelligence from the look the creature gave him. The river noise was loud enough to cover any noise the family would have made riding up the road.  The witness stated that the creature was moving with a relaxed, easy gait, swinging its arms and covering ground very fast.  The sighting only lasted about 10 seconds, and then the creature disappeared behind some trees.  ",

            "Observed": "This is an old report so I don't know if it will be of any use but my wife and I remember it as if it were yesterday.  We had just moved to California from Colorado and didn't know anywhere to hike so we drove to a Ranger Station in Shasta Lake. We bought a map and although it was the 4th of July weekend we asked the rangers if there was anyplace we could go that would be isolated or not too crowded. We got a fire permit because we were planning to 4 wheel somewhere remote and then hike to a camp area. We were told to drive on a logging road next to squaw creek and were shown some turns to take to end up past the last campground on Squaw creek. We drove until we spotted a stream leading up to a meadow about 200 yards from the road. We crossed a deep creek with our camping gear and helped our dog cross because the water was swift enough to make swimming across difficult. We set up our tent and decided to follow the creek to see if fishing might be good. We were surprised by an abandoned beaver dam and the pond was full of fish. I wanted to hike a bit further and my wife wanted to finish some reading so she went back to camp with the dog. I continued hiking until I heard something following me. When I stopped it stopped. I suspected I was being followed by a couger so I made lots of noise by stepping on branches and acting like I wasn't afraid of anything. I still stopped from time to time to look toward the area of the noise and had my knife ready along with a big stick that I purposely hit against rocks and trees to make myself appear aggressive. Finally I got back to camp and my wife asked me what was going on. I didn't want to scare her so I said it was getting dark and had to get some firewood. She said the dog had been growling and looking in the direction from which I had come. I still didn't say anything mainly because I wasn't afraid because I had packed a gun with plenty of ammo. I had been hunting and in the woods all my life. I figured a fire would keep the lion away along with our talking and laughing, plus we had a big husky dog that was a good protector. When I got back to camp with some wood my wife informed me that the dog must have taked a poop around the camp site because it stunk. It did smell but I was unable to find anything to get rid of. We lit a fire and cooked then settled back to let the fire burn out. When the fire got low we were terrified by the sound of breaking branches and a sound unlike anything I have ever heard in my life. I screamed to my wife to throw more wood on the fire and rushed to the tent to get my gun. I was bowled over first by my wife then the dog. I got the gun and yelled to my wife to get the flashlights. We threw more wood on the fire and heard something retreat. At this point I got my composure back and we shined our very bright lights into the woods hoping to pick out a pair of eyes. When I didn't see any I was alamed because I thought all animals eyes glowed in the dark as they reflected light. I was thinking that there must be a man out there trying to scare us. So I yelled for whoever was out there to identify himself because I has a gun and was prepared to shoot if I heard another noise. Now I had to tell my wife what had happened on my hike and what I still assume is correct about animals eyes. We talked about going back to the bronco and leaving but decided it was too risky to walk 200 yards through the woods and then have to cross the steam in the dark where we could easily step in a hole and lose the gun or be at a big disadvantage. We decided to burn a big fire all night and stay awake. As frightened as we were I talked my wife into getting some sleep on my lap and I would stay awake. She fell asleep and then so did I. We were startled awake by the dog growling and something rushing toward us through the trees. We threw more wood on the fire and screamed into the woods that we were ready to shoot. Again a retreat as the fire got bigger. Now we were definitly awake for the rest of the night. The next morning we packed up and left. When we got down to the stream I remembered my axe shovel and saw were still at the camp so I went back for them. I was greeted by a horrible smell, but that was it so I grabbed my things and ran down the hill. When I got close to the stream I slowed down and started walking. My wife informed me that right after I left the dog was growling and looking in the direction that I had taken. Since this incident we now camp in designated campsites that have other campers. We always used to 4 wheel or hike to places to camp that were completly isolated. We never considered bigfoot until I told my story to a new friend and he mentioned that the situation was similar to bigfoot related incidents.",

The witness and his wife utilized four-wheel drive vehicles to get to the site, crossing a river and continuing approximately 200 yards to the meadow where they camped.  The witness indicated initially the creature was following him at an approximate distance of 50 feet as he walked back to his campsite after hiking alone. Later that evening after they had eaten dinner and the campfire began to fade, they both heard something very large coming at them from beyond the tree line. The witness indicated it was extremely loud, breaking branches, then \"whatever it was let out a howl that sounded like a sick mountain lion or like several people all making the noise at one time\". The witness and his wife scanned the tree line with their flashlights but could not see any animal eyes glowing back at them.  The witness added that he could hear something circling their camp, and when the fire got low, it sounded as though it was coming closer. The witness indicated he did not look for any prints the next morning, just wanted to leave as soon as possible. The witness also added that he never camps out in remote areas any longer, and that he makes sure there are lots of people around. I found this witness to be truthful and credible.",
