This quality made us panic, and my brother quickly slammed the window shut.",

My mom was born and raised in Dee, later moving to California as an adult.  My grandparents have been gone for over ten years now, and the orchard is now in possession of another owner (not known).  There is still someone living in this location, although the actual home has been replaced by a new structure.  The orchard still looks about the same.  The property is about an acre in area.",

My grandparents are no longer alive.

My brother was practicing taking photographs of the moon.  He was taking pictures from our south-facing window (no screen) that looks out over a beautiful orchard landscape in the Hood River Valley that leads up to the foot of Mount Hood.  The window is above a long, straight, east-to-west gravel driveway that leads up to a detached garage.  The property is approximately 1 acre.",

The sound started deep enough to be referred to as a growl. The perception of the two boys was that the sound was deliberately directed at them. A possibility is that the sasquatch was feeding on apples in the orchard and was surprised/annoyed by motion in the nearby window. The vocalization was about 10 seconds long.Full moon occurred on the 27th of July and the event presumably near midnight. The West Fork of the Hood River is about 1,000' from this location.",

            "Observed": "It is pretty sickning that I am saying this now considering it has been 10 years ago. It was a August morning outside brackettville tx or inside kinney county. Time was roughly between 7:00 and 7:30 we were coming back from laredo on hwy 131 Up ahead we both noticed a large hairy creature moving across the road. This was about 300 yards away from us. We both said that must be a bear and when we get to that spot we should stop. well we got to the spot and nothing just a patch of hair on the barb wire fence now with that in mind the fence stood about 4 1/2 feet high Bears have not been known to climb barbwire fences nor have they been seen in that part of the country for a long time. We both got pack in the truck and proceeded back to brackettville. When I got home I called my father who was a border patrol supervisor and told him the story. He told me that there has been several sighting in the area from local ranchers of seeing the type of creature. He told me not to worry it was probably just a bear from the mountains. Mountains I thought to myself Mountains are like a least 100-250 miles away from here. I just couldnt understand.   Now 1/13/2005 I saw some clues that i diddnt see before...there is a cave in that area called kickapoo caverns now it isnt open to the public and in the area alone there is tons of dome mountains or really big hills and plateus. I was thinking maybe it was a bigfoot we saw on that morning back in 1994 in august. The area of Kinney County is big and unspoiled. I would not be suprised if there are more sightings in this area the problem is you talk about this out there and people think your nuts. but there still are few people that will speak out if they have the chance to do so(resoures)_",
