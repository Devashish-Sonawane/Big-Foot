            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to Mr. P over the phone as well as corresponded with him by email and he was agreeable about providing me with other details about this sighting. The Elk County photos he is referring to are known as the Jacobs Photos.After riding his dirt bike he decided to shut the bike off to gather berries. Leaving his bike parked on the path and after gathering a handful of berries, Mr. P decided to walk quietly towards a pipeline clearing in the hopes of seeing deer, or other wildlife.A bit downhill from him he noticed a large tree lying on the ground across the pipeline and saw what he thought was the back-end of a bear sticking up behind the tree. Having done this in the past, Mr. P decided to sneak up as close to this \u0091bear\u0092 as he dared until he got within about 50 yards uphill from it. The \u0091bear\u0092 still had not noticed his presence so he decided to step on a few twigs to get its attention.Almost immediately Mr. P saw a face pop up over the log and it made a grunting noise. \u0093I saw then that it was not a bear, but a hair-covered face that looked almost human.\u0094 Stated Mr. P. \"I was frozen! I couldn\u0092t believe what I was seeing! Then it stood up. I knew then that it was definitely a bigfoot and he stared at me for what seemed like another minute, looking me right in the eyes.\u0094Mr. P believes at this point the creature was trying to intimidate him. He said that he was terrified at that point. Not by the actions of the creature, but what it was capable of. After a minute or so of standing still and having the creature still glaring at him, Mr. P purposefully, but still feeling terrified, decided to drop a few berries with the thought that this might break its concentration; and this worked. The creature then turned and walked to the far side of the pipeline and then into the woods.The terrain it walked over was very rough, stated Mr. P, but it walked over 45-50 feet of this rough ground in only 6 or 7 strides. And it swung its arms the whole time.Mr. P immediately ran back to his bike and sped off as fast as he could. But after several minutes, for reasons he could not fathom, he turned around and went back to the place he saw the creature walk into. He says that it never occurred to him to look for footprints, but to just look for the creature again. But the area it had walked into was rough and a bit \u0091spooky\u0092, so Mr. P turned back around and went home. The description of the creature he saw was this--It stood 7 foot tall, but could have been taller.-It\u0092s hair was dark brown colored with reddish highlights. Its hair was longish on its shoulders and head, with an almost \u0091shag\u0092 haircut style configuration on its head.-Although he tried getting a good look at its face he could not recall any details. He does adamantly recall that it looked more human than ape.-Its arms were long and hung down to its knees.-He does not recall any details of the creature from its waist down since the majority of the sighting occurred behind the huge, fallen tree and because he was looking at the creature on the slope of a hill.-He described the head as being rounded like a human\u0092s head. He said that it did not appear conical.-He said that the shoulders were massive, with a very muscular neck.-He could not make out any ears. -He recalls that it was very masculine in its proportions. Besides the broad shoulders and chest it had a relatively slim waist. There were no obvious genitals. The area Mr. P sighted the bigfoot was in a large swath of half-cleared land close to the Bradford city limits that was being used for oil pipelines, lease roads and other municipality purposes. The areas surrounding this land, besides the small city of Bradford, is comprised of farms, rural tenants and seldom used hilly, woodlands. There is a healthy population of deer in this area as well as numerous fresh water creeks and ponds. There is also an abundance of wild blackberry and strawberry plants as well as plenty of apple trees in this vicinity.Even though the encounter was terrifying to Mr. P, he told me that he still feels protective towards it, as well as all other bigfoots. \"It just looked so human and I was awed by its presence. I don't want it to ever be harmed.\"This sighting was in the same area as another sighting that occurred in 1963, Report #9546.",
