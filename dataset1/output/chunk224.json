They scared me, so I ran into my trailer with my dad and step mom.  I didn't know that this could be a Bigfoot until just last week end, when I found out that I was going to be camping this summer at Smith River (I heard that the most recent sighting was 8 months ago). I came to this website and read about the sightings in the Sugar Pine area and heard the Bigfoot screams.  I realized that was the sound that I heard and it was in fact the famous wails and whooping sounds of sasquatch!  Bigfoot does exist!  The next year (2001; I go every year) I found what looked like humungus human tracks but with only 4 toes (I am not positive they were related to Bigfoot though).",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness by phone.  The sister of the witness submitted report 3794.  The following details can be added to the report:--Witness and family go to Sugar Pine every year and they have been hearing the \"screams\" for several years.--Family is very familar with local wildlife sounds.--They usually stay three days and they hear the screams most nights.--It appears to be at least two individuals, a young animal, and an older one, calling back and forth to each other.  The young one (high pitched) usually appears to be closer to the camp, while the older one (lower pitched) seems to be further away (youth and mother?).--Screams only happen on clear nights.  No screams are heard on cloudy nights.--Father recognized the screams as well when he heard the sounds on the website.--This sound report occurred during the same time period as other reported screams in the area.  The \"young\" one and \"old\" one have been recorded from this very area.  ",
