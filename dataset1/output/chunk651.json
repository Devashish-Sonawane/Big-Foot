            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and he recalled every detail from memory without being prompted.  He was very articulate and credible as he recounted his story and how he felt during this very intense encounter in the Canyon Park area near the city of Woodinville.Additional information provided by the witness:\u0095 At the end of the chase he estimated the creature was standing only five or six feet away.\u0095 The creature was in the shadows and couldn\u0092t be seen, but its breath could be seen, silhouetted in the chilly night air against the faint light from a neighbor\u0092s porch light.\u0095 The creature was exhaling at a height just above the six foot height of the witness.\u0095 The creature smelled \u0093incredibly bad\u0094.\u0095 The witness felt that the creature was looking directly at his eyes, although he could not see the creature.\u0095 The witness did not feel threatened, but was still very shaken by the event.\u0095 During the week leading up to this encounter, a \u0093multi-chorus of howling\u0094 was often heard around the friend\u0092s house at night, with green eye-shine being seen at a height of four to five feet off of the ground.  The eyes were about four inches apart.  The witness and his friend would occasionally run at the location of the eyes, chasing them into the brush away from them.See the picture below for a diagram of the events.At the time of this encounter the location was semi-rural and near a greenbelt that eventually leads to the foothills of the Cascade Mountains.  Many houses have since been built in the area and the greenbelt has been reduced. But there are still plenty of wooded areas left that would allow such a large creature to pass through without being seen.  The facts of this encounter appear to indicate that the witness was raced/chased by an intelligent creature that is not only curious but also has a somewhat competitive, yet non-aggressive attitude.
