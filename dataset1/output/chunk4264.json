            "Observed.1  ": "swamp monster has made an appearance  in the area of its traditional haunts. Described by eyewitnesses as a hairy  creature that stands upright and moves with  remarkable speed, the creature is usually  sighted in a wooded and swampy area about  one mile north of Parramore and roughly  seven miles northeast of the main Two Egg  crossroads. The latest sighting took place in this area  during the first week of June. A motorist was  traveling north on Oak Grove Road from its  intersection with Circle Hill Road and saw a  strange creature bolt across the dirt road  through the glow of her headlights. Although she had only a brief glimpse of the  monster in her headlights as darkness had  fallen, the eyewitness said that it appeared to  have long shaggy hair, was gray in color and  about or slightly below the height of a grown  man, but appeared quite bulky. This is consistent with other sightings of the  creature, which is usually described as a  grayish or brownish \"mini-Bigfoot\" like  monster, although with a round head instead  of the \"peaked\" head often described by  eyewitnesses who say they have seen  Bigfoot. At least one eyewitness, however,  also reported that the Stump Jumper has a  \"raccoon-like tail.\" The latest eyewitness did not observe a  noticeable tail, but indicates she was so  stunned by its sudden appearance that she  might not have noticed one. The sighting is typical of others. The creature  has almost always been seen in and near  the small, swampy ponds north of Parramore  crossroads and usually only as it is crossing  the road or running away into the darkness. It has never been seen in daylight hours,  prompting most to believe it is nocturnal in its  habits. What made this sighting different, however,  is that it did leave behind some physical  evidence. A search of the area on the day  after the monster was spotted running  across the road revealed unusual footprints  crossing a plowed fire lane about 200 yards  from the sighting location. The prints were approximately 8 inches long  and were rather bizarre. They were of a foot  that appeared to have a large \"big toe\" or  thumb and then two smaller toes, creating an  almost \"hand-like\" appearance, minus two  fingers or toes.  The monster story is a growing part of the  lore of the Two Egg - Parramore area. .",
