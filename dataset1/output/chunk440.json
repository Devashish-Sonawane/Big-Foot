            "Follow-Up Report": "I called the wife tonight, the 14th of July 2009, who is the witness that turned in the report.  We discussed her very brief visual sighting that took place on the north side of highway 50 where this creature was just standing, and seemed to be watching the cars and trucks moving along this highway. She usually spends most of her time looking for deer while they are driving down through the mountains and this tree lined highway; sort of an early warning system. She and her husband's total viewing time was just a few seconds. This creature was standing about 20 to 30 feet off of the road in a vehicle pull out area from where their vehicle was moving down the road at least 55 mph traveling towards Sacramento. This witness said that it was the hairiest creature she had ever seen, plus it was big and scary, and it seemed to be a very dark brown to a blackish color. The witness did view the eyes on this creature's face, but no other details. I asked her if she noticed any other distinguishing characteristics like what might be its gender? She stated that she never noticed any type of gender, but that she did notice its humanistic features like its head, legs and its height for sure.I asked if I could speak with her husband who might corroborate her story, and she introduced him to me and we spoke for quite some time on this subject and several others. He was a second witness for sure, describing a very thick and massive creature standing there looking like a large tree that just looked out of place in that pull out area. He further stated that it was as at least three feet thick from its shoulders down to its feet.This witness said that he had his high beams on which illuminated this creature as their vehicle passed by and he thought it may have jumped as the lights hit it, and that's how he may have first noticed this creature. The husband's first impression was that a tree was growing in a vehicle pull out section, and that was just plain wrong. His viewing time was very short. He also described its color as being a very dark brown to black.In summary, we now have two more confirmed believers, which know for sure that these creatures are out there for real. One reason that I took this report is the fact that I have an extensive report that I am working on that takes place in the same area.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone:The witness had turkey hunted at this site for eight years. When he arrived with his hunting partner, they found a new cooler with newer utensils and cookware. Two logs, six to eight inches diameter and ten to twelve feet long were in an X shape over a small pine tree about ten feet high. One end of each log rested on the ground. The ends of the logs were splintered and not cut. The two hunters cut these logs into firewood.The witness describes the noise on the camper as a violent bang that rocked the camper. The door handle jiggled but was not opened. The side window blinds had fallen. At first he thought people made the bang and listened for any vehicles on the forest service road. There is a farm about one half mile away. He did not hear anything. The next day they tried to recreate the sound but could not match the loudness. No dents were found on the camper. They saw a very small black bear but the witness does not believe it was large enough to create the loudness of the bang. Since the camper was not pushed, but seemed to be slapped, the witness was unsettled by the event. The witness has hunted since a teenager. I find him very credible. ",
