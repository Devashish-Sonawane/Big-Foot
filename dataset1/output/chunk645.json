As I approached the car I got an eerie feeling that something was watching me so I turned around to look and there across the road from me, was a tall hairy creature looking at me. I was so scared I could not move at first. But then I ran back into the house and told them what I saw. No one would go out to look they were too scared. I know what I saw and it wasn't a bear or a person playing a joke. It was around 8 to 9 feet tall and very large. I couldn't see its face it was too dark and there was only light from a house down the road where it became forest.",

He no longer lives in the area of the sighting.Granite Falls has grown substantially since the witness lived there in 1971.  Although it is still a small town, the downtown area has grown and has been modernized, with many new residents moving into the area each year.Granite Falls is one of the gateways to the Mountain Loop Highway in Washington state.  There have been many reports from the Mountain Loop area over the years, including the following:Report # 41602.Report # 37307.Report # 37101.Report # 26353.Report # 25882.Report # 23170.Report # 23017.Report # 16276.Report # 1880.Report # 1722.Report # 1672.The Mountain Loop Highway is a highway in the state of Washington. It traverses the western section of the Cascade Range within Snohomish County. The name suggests it forms a full loop, but it is only a small portion of a loop, which is completed using State Routes 92, 9, and 530. Part of the highway is also a designated and signed Forest Highway, and is known as Forest Route 20.The highway connects the towns of Granite Falls and Darrington. It is paved for 34 miles (55 km) from Granite Falls to Barlow Pass (2349') where the highway becomes unpaved for 13 miles (21 km), and then paved again for the remaining 9 miles (14 km) to Darrington. The unpaved section is U.S. Forest Service Road #20 and passes several USFS campgrounds. Portions of the unpaved section are often closed for periods of several years due to flood damage.",
