It sounded like someone outside your home talking but could not make it out. Kind of like an 8 track tape player that was eating the tape. I did not smell anything like a wild animal but this could be because the wind blowing on top of the ridge. I looked for footprints or hair samples but came up empty handed.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "A site visit was performed in this area on 6/15/13, and the following can be added to this report.  The sighting took place on the Shadebush Trail in Salt Fork State Park.  It was about a 3/4 mile down the 2 mile trail.  At the point of first seeing these animals, the witness was approximately two hundred feet away on a ridge that was mostly cleared of brush.  When I went to that spot he stated that they were much bigger than myself.  I am about six feet tall.  He also stated that they made me look small.  The two animals were dark in color and the witness describes them as huge.  The witness describes the arms as long, longer than a human.  Their walk was weird as they were sort of squatting as they walked.  The closest that he was to the animals was upon the initial sighting. The witness was not able to discern any specific features on the animals as he was not close enough.  He did note that the hair was not matted and had a slight shine to it.  When the animal turned to look at the witness, the animal turned its whole body.  The witness also did not notice a neck and describes the turning motion as stiff.  Photo taken by the witness using his cell phone:The witness looked for and did not find footprints or hair.There is a small gulley that needs to be traversed to get to this location.  From the ridge, which is about 50 feet higher in elevation than the trail he was walking on, it is easy to pick up movement and see clearly.  The witness crossed the gulley and proceeded to follow the animals.  He followed them approximately one thousand feet along this ridge line before they went out of sight.  The area on either side of this ridge has ravines that are thick with vegetation.  They also lead down to the lake to the northwest.  Deer sign was noticed in several places along the ridge line.  The surrounding woods:Interesting eyeshine captured while in the area at dark:Possibly some type of structure:",
