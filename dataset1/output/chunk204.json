            "Observed": "I was driving northbound on route 146. I was driving with my sister (the only other person in the car) and she was looking down at her I-Pod and was in the front passenger seat. The traffic was average not too many cars but a few, and I was doing about 65-68 mph.  I looked about 3/4 of a mile ahead and saw something off to the rightside of the highway not on the highway but near the woodline on the grass. At first it looked like someone possibly in a gilley suit but then as I got closer I couldn't believe my eyes because it looked just like what you hear about and see artist renderings of a bigfoot like creature. It was too tall to be a person in a suit approx. 7-8ft tall and very broad with black hair. I couldn't see any specific facial features or chest features as it turned into the woods when i was about 1/8 of a mile away. It was walking parralell to the woodline then took a 90 degree turn into the woods. When I saw this I immediately slowed down to about 50mph and looked intently into the woodline by this time I was able to get my sisters attention (she was listening to music on the I-Pod looking down) we both stared into the woods and Icouldn't see anything but see thinks she saw something black moving in the woods. I still can't believe what I saw, there was no cars parked on the left or right shoulders of the highway. The creature did not appear to be running the entire sighting lasted for 7-8 seconds. I am very sure of what I saw it was a dark haired looked very much like a bear walking on two legs.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and he recalled the early evening sighting with high similarity to the written submission.  The following additional information was obtained during the 20 minute interview.The witness observed the biped animal for a total duration of approximately 8-10 seconds.  At least one, possibly two cars were moving in the same direction approximately 0.5 miles in front of the witness's car and passed directly by the creature.  The witness did not recall seeing brake lights illuminated on these cars,suggesting that these cars did not slow down or stop.The witness stated that the animal appeared to walk with a slight forward lean and had long arms that were held down along side a lean framed body.  Along with dark, black hair the creature appeared to have patches of light grayish hair on its chest.  Further physical features could not be identified due to the distance of the sighting. The witness observed the animal moving in the opposite direction of his car (walking directly toward the witness) and completed approximately 10 to 12 steps before disappearing into the woodline.  The approximate distance from the road to the woodline is 15 yards.The sighting occurred in the Eastern New England Upland region which is marked by rolling hills populated by hardwoods (oaks, red maple and eastern white pines) with numerous small lakes and ponds. Within 1/4 mile of the sighting there is swamp and a powerline that runs roughly parallel to Rt. 146. In relative proximity to the sighting are forest patches ranging is size from 250 to >2500 acres.

After we dropped them off we headed back south to Barnsdall, we were driving and something caught my eye on the side of the road.  I looked over and my friend was seeing the same thing. It was bent over in a ditch by a guardrail and was about 5 feet tall squatted down.  It was probably about 3 to 4 foot wide. As we passed it just kinda glanced over at us. This was happening around 1:00 a.m. that night. We were just blank minded and then finally decided to turn around and go back to see if we could still see it. But when we got back there we couldn't find the creature. We back the next day and could only find flattened grass.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The following can be added to the report after speaking to both witnesses: - The creature was squatting, but the height of the creature was greater than four feet in height in that position. - The witnesses could see its head, but could not make out any facial features. - The animal appeared to have an orange-colored eye shine.- Its shoulders appeared to be about four to five feet wide. - The creature watched the vehicle as it went by, turning its head as the vehicle passed. - The creature was squatted like a person would squat down; not like a bear.  - They both stated that they would not want to see this creature again.  They had heard of other stories in the area, but did not believe them until this incident.",
