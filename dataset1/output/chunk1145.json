I live in the Hatchie River Bottoms. Around September of 2013 it started again. It has started again March of 2014. I have looked but can't see any thing. It is a very wooded area with a lot of wildlife. It seems to be passing thru. I am disabled and can't run into the woods. It usually stars about 8:30 or 9:00 at night. None of my neighbors report any noises. This month it only lasts to about 10:30. Any help finding out what it is would be appreciated.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on 11 May 2014. He explained to me that he has been hearing what sounds like wood knocks, starting in the early spring of 2013.  He said they would start around 9 pm and last around 30 minutes.  The first time he heard this knocking sound was March 2013 and he thought someone was breaking into his shed, but when he went out on to the back porch the noise stopped. His house is just off the Hatch River with several big ravines running around his home.  The knocks continued throughout the spring of 2013, and stopped during the summer.  They started back up in the fall of 2013, and stopped during the winter.  The witness stated that the knocking sounds started again in March, 2014 and are still on-going as of May 2014, which he said was a little longer than normal this year.  On May 7th he heard the sounds starting at 9:07 pm, Thursday the 8th they started around 9:10 pm, Friday the 9th they started around 10:00 pm and Saturday the 10th they started around 9:20 pm. All these sound events last about 30 minutes.  They start with one knock and a minute will go by then another and so on.  The witness\u0092 nearest neighbor behind him is on the other side of the ravine about 500 yards.  That property with a cabin belongs to someone who only visits the property occasionally, usually on weekends, which means it is vacant the majority of the time.  The witness stated he has spoken to the local sheriff and his neighbors and no one else has heard anything.  He has heard no howls, whistles or any other noises that are out of the ordinary. He said he cannot tell if the knocks are answered from different directions, as he only hears the ones that are close to his home.I walked the ravine behind the witness' house down one side and followed it to the road leading back to the house which runs into the Hatchie River, then I crossed over and came back up the other side to where it runs into a large pond, passing behind the neighbor's cabin and another vacant house.  I crossed back over and started back toward the witness' property and I came across several tree breaks, arches, limbs placed in a V and a large tree that had been shoved up into the Y of another large tree. I did not find any tracks in the ravine bottom, which was wet and had a lot of deer tracks and scat.  Pictures: All these where on the left side of his house, about 100-200 yards away.  No other signs in the ravines.",

There are a number of wetlands in the immediate vacinity.  We had a pond which is now dried up, our neighbor had a pond (still do) and the swamp where the creature came from was a haven for wetland birds.  Around March all these ponds are full of frogs mating and laying eggs, which ducks and herons would feed on.  There was a large amount of undeveloped land all around.  We had an orchard and many of the people in the area including us raised chickens, rabbits and goats.   The fruit trees tended to draw deer.  At night we would sometimes hear something large leaning on the goat gate, grunting and rattling it.  We assumed it was a bear.",
