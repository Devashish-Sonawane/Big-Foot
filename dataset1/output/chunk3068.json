            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness over the phone, I learned that the incident occurred on the third, and last night of camping at Copper Basin.  T.R. was alone in a one-man pup tent when he heard heavy footfalls near the head of his tent.  He was unable to discern whether the steps were those of a bi-pedal or a quadruped animal. He searched for foot prints the following morning, but the ground was very dry and none were found. T.R. noted that other members of his camping party, including a dog, were unaware of the late night visitor. Intense feelings of fear and dread came upon T.R. suddenly as he became aware of the footfalls.  These feelings disappeared suddenly and completely when the visitor left.  This emotional response was unlike anything the witness had experienced before or since.  T.R. is an experienced outdoorsman, who has camped at Copper Basin for years.",

            "Also Noticed": "At the time I was not thinking of sasquatch.  A man who helped us fix a flat tire on the way up, said he came from this same area with horses.  He reported seeing a moose and bear signs in the area.  But the more I think about the incident, I am wondering that it may have been something else.  All other sasquatch close encounters seem to be preceded by a similar feeling of fear, anxiety, and \"being watched.\"  It was suggested this may be some sort of defensive pheromone response.  I was not particularly frightened by the prospect of a bear encounter.  I felt adequately armed to deal with something like that.  But I can't forget the paralyzing fear and sense of dread I felt suddenly, and then the feeling going away just as suddenly."
