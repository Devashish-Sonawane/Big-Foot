            "Follow-Up Report": "After meeting SR he drove the two of us to the location, which is less than a half mile from Carl Albert State College. Here are a few other things my investigation has brought to light. SR was on his way home from working a over night shift at work, driving north. The animal was spotted on the left side of the road moving to his right or east at a slight angle away. He was adamant on the height of the animal. It was a dark brown/black with long hair covering the entire body. It had no neck. He also described a hunched over gliding walk with arms swinging. He was unable to make any facial features out. And it only took 3-4 steps to go from ditch to ditch. He tried to reproduce this for me and it took 7-8 steps to achieve the same distance at the same angle it traveled. There was a clear open spot in the tree/fence line where it disappeared. On the other side of this fence/tree line is a pretty large field with wooded areas surround the field on nearly all sides.  The fence is a standard 3 strand bob wire fence. As SR approached the spot where he seen the animal cross he heard a very loud growl. When asked about the growl he described it as like a bear growl or roar but much louder and a little different. He was going very slow with all four windows down and the radio was off as he looked to see where the animal had gone or if it was still there. SR seems to be a very credible witness. Who has never really ever given much thought to the existence of Bigfoots.  He is a hard working family man who wants to stay anonymous. ",
