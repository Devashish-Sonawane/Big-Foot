            "Observed": "My sighting occurred over twenty years ago, in the fall of 1978, so I don't know if this will be helpful to anyone or not.  I was driving on highway U.S. 2 across Michigan's Upper Peninsula, which skirts the northernmost shores of Lake Michigan.  I had been been driving with my 18-month-old son in the car seat next to me, all day from Minneapolis towards St. Ignace,Mich. and had grown sleepy. So I stopped at a roadside picnic area about 20 miles east (maybe more) of Manistique, Michigan on the edge of the Hiawatha",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Upon speaking with the witness, it became increasingly amazing to hear her story.  She had told very few people about it over time and did eventually tell her son although only recently.  Amazed at why she didn't tell him, her only answer to him was, \"Would you??\"  I am told he did understand  and was appreciative of her finally deciding to share this experience.  From the area originally,  she mentioned that she felt it was not possible for a person dressed up to have bent over in such a way to peer into the vehicle which was a late 60's model Saab station wagon. (Especially without bracing against the glass.)     I asked about her view on the eyes and she did mention perhaps as wide as 2.5 inches or so... and they were very bright and seemed to glow some...  a brownish amber color.  Her view was influenced by the reflection of the dome light and the  light from the vehicle headlights,  both of which stayed on during the entire duration of the observation. It was stated that the eyes gave it a human looking appearance... despite their large size..    She further mentioned the cheeks as being rather flat, big enough that her hand could easily fit in them. The hair line on the creature was approximately two inches above the eyes with no hair on the brow.   Below its mouth the hairline started about two inches away and got progressively longer.This sighting is being further  researched with regard to specific facial details which should give  additional information on its anatomy and physical appearance.  At no time did it appear that it was aggressive. It did not take its gaze off her son except to cock its head for a moment with regard to her presence....  In all the exchanges I had with the witness, it was amazing to hear the repeated details that further strengthened the image in my mind of what she saw that night in the late 70's.  After what seemed like minutes but may have actually been less than one, she threw the vehicle into reverse and drove off. ",
