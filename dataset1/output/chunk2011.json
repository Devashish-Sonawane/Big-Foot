Witness stepped outside the house for a breath of air late at night (between 11 & 12 pm) and was treated to a series of close range vocalizations described as \"overpowering\" in volume and of a wailing-roar-scream in timbre.  Vocalizations began less than 1 minute after she exited the house and came from across a small dirt road \"about a basketball court away\" in range.  The calls were 5 - 10 seconds in duration, repeating approximately 6 times with about a one second pause in between.  It is possible the witness surprised and/or startled the animal which was either passing by or loitering close to the otherwise dark, quiet house.  The witness additionally described the vocalizations as a \"scream-moan-something hurt\" with enough power to be clearly heard reverbrating throughout the surrounding area, a mix of woods and farm fields.  There were no other witnesses and nothing additional heard or seen.The type and volume of the calls do not correspond to any know local wildlife.  The area has a history of vocalization reports and sightings (where the animals are referred to as ' wood apes ' ) going back to the pre-colonial period.",
