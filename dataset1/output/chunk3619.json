            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness that heard the call and filed this report on the afternoon of Monday March 4th 2013; the following details can be added.The vocalization was heard at approximately 11PM by the witness, his camping companions and several other campers. One of the campers was a police officer who became alarmed by the sound and suggested everyone get in their vehicles for safety. Another camper was an avid hunter of 20 plus years and said he never heard a wildlife call like this before.The vocalization was outside the campgrounds, but less than a mile away. The witness said it sounded like there was a certain degree of intelligence behind the howl and what ever made the call seemed to be angry at something. I asked the witness if they could recall the exact month this happened. Being that this took place 20 years ago the witness was not sure, but was sure it was over the summer.Upon hearing that Bobo's call sounded very similar to what the witness heard I emailed the witness a link to the 1994 Ohio howl, which is also attached to this report above. The witness said this sounded very similar to what he heard and brought chills to his spine just like when he heard Bobo's call on the Finding Bigfoot program.This area of New Jersey has a history of Sasquatch encounters and sightings, and the local name for Bigfoots in this area of the state is Big Red Eye.",
