            "Follow-Up Report": "I called this witness and talked with her about her experience.  The location is very near I-5, but is still quite wooded, especially to the south-east. There is a very large tract of forested land, with no roads, that could support a population of sasquatches.The witness lives very close to the property where she was living when she was 15 when she had the encounter.  The property is still in the family, and is owned by her grandparents. She lives less than a quarter mile away to the west.  To get permission to do a site survey, she will have to talk to her grandmother.  The witness said that she was dropped off by the school bus in the late afternoon around 4:00PM.  She said that something big was following her as she walked along the pipeline access road.  It was on her left, and estimated to be only 20 feet away.  She could not see it, which is typically reported in such cases.  She did not notice any smell.  It followed her all the way to the clearing where the house was being constructed.  It did not come out of the forest.  This is typical sasquatch behavior.Later that night, between 2:00 and 3:00PM, she heard what sounded like a monkey whoop.  It repeated about 5-6 times.  Then it made a wailing sound, which she said sounded sad.  The wailing sound was long and drawn out.  It was very loud.This person is obviously an outdoorswoman.  She has lived in the area all her life.  She hunts and fishes, and told me about fishing the Toutle River recently and what animal tracks she found there.  She keeps an eye out for sasquatch tracks, but so far has only seen bear, cougar, fox and coyote.  Many people mistake a bear track for a sasquatch track.  This witness has the knowledge and experience to know the difference.  This makes her report very reliable.  Based on the description of what she heard and experienced, the behavior is clearly consistent with what we have come to expect from sasquatches.",
