We were Archery Elk hunting. We pulled off the main road and went on a dirt road as far as we could until we came to a small group of trees and so we pulled into those trees and set up camp. My friends found a spot about 100 feet from my camper and set up there. It wasn\u0092t a very level area and so I found some big rocks and drove my truck up on to level it out. We spent a couple of days there and nothing unusual happened.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I called the witness and talked to him for well over an hour about his experience. The experience took place about twenty years ago, but left a lasting impression in the witness\u0092 mind. He said he can still close his eyes and see the whole thing taking place again. The witness has the location marked as a point on Google Earth, and he sent me a printout so I could see exactly where the incident took place.A couple of things really stood out in my conversation with the witness. One was how scared he was at the time. He told me there are two kinds of fear \u0096 there\u0092s the fear that your child is hurt, and then there\u0092s \u0093flat-out fear\u0094. This experience was one of flat-out fear for the witness.Another thing that stood out in the conversation was the witness\u0092 remorse: remorse that he didn\u0092t look out to see what was out there, and remorse that he didn\u0092t look around more for evidence the next day. He said it tears him up when he thinks about it, and that he\u0092d give almost anything to go back and relive the experience. He said the event has been really plaguing him for about the last five years. At the time of the incident the witness didn\u0092t think about the possibility of a bigfoot hitting his camper (at that time he thought they only lived in the northwest).  Now he can\u0092t think of any other logical explanation than a bigfoot.  After reading the account, and talking to the witness about it, I can\u0092t think of any other explanation either. I think the camper may have indeed been rocked by a bigfoot, probably hitting it with a rock or something. The witness said he thinks it would\u0092ve had to have been a rock about the size of a bowling ball to make such a big dent in the camper. The witness said he and his friends tried to rock the camper back and forth the next day, and were unable to make it rock anything like it rocked when it was hit in the night. I am convinced that the witness and his family had the experience described in this report, and I think it was a bigfoot that hit the camper. _____________________________Editor Note (Matt Moneymaker):The apparent slapping of a camper or trailer or cabin is a recurring observation among witnesses.  The purpose is apparently to scare the humans, to make them want to leave the area. This would make sense when deer/elk hunters have entered an area, especially at the beginning of the season before the deer/elk have moved into less accessible areas. On some occasions the trailer or camper is rocked violently, rather than pounded or slapped.On other occasions, when slaps were heard against the side of a rural home or cabin, the intention did not seem hostile or frustrated, but rather like a way of  \"knocking on the door\" to encourage the human occupants to come outside.  This has been reported most often when the only occupants were women, or women with children (no adult human males present).In this case, the damage and the severity of the blows would suggest a territorial protest attack, which typically happens in circumstances where the animal can remain hidden from view.",
