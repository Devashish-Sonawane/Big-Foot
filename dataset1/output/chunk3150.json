            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is very competent and credible.  She\u0092s a retired 28-yr crime analyst who helps her elderly father and disabled brother at her father\u0092s home.   We\u0092ve talked several times but her family recently allowed me to investigate the location.  I sat down with all three who each had several stories about how they interacted with a creature, possibly a few, for almost a year. The best piece of their experience was her father, an older gentleman, who absolutely did not believe the creatures his 60 year old kids were dealing with were real.  That is until he walked right up to one face to face one early evening.  He took the trash out one afternoon and standing barely 20 feet away from his trash bin was a creature standing over eight feet tall in between a large tree and a worn down classic car.  After a few seconds it walks away and he returns to his home.  He walks into the house (he built) and nonchalantly tells his daughter and son,\u0094One of those gorilla men are out back\u0094. They believe the primary creature is a female, whom they named \u0093Trudy\u0094  based on its gentle voice and how it gestures toward the other creatures. Her brother encountered a larger, more dominant creature whom they think is the male father.  Additionally, they think there are at least four creatures in the family unit. She fed and offered gifts from their back yard as they never felt threatened by any of the creatures.   The creatures would toy with the family but were never aggressive. Many times, while sitting on their back porch, they would have small rocks tossed just short of them over several minutes. The two families interacted with each other as she continued to gift the creatures.  Eventually, she stopped feeding them when she got new neighbors and thought the creatures could be in danger. it stopped and while members of the family would occasionally see one of the creatures, it seemed like the creatures had just moved on from a continued presence near their property.  When the witness interacted with the creatures she\u0092d be down in the woods feeding and when they were near she smelled them or heard them, sometimes a soft kind growl and sometimes a rock tossed.  There was always a scent of wet soured horse, a stench. She left different items where some were accepted and others refused.  They would like or not like gifts as such:  1. Bread was always taken, as were nuts, peanut butter.2. Raw eggs at the base of the gift tree they would tap the ends of the eggs, suck them dry and leave the shells. 3. Boiled eggs were taken. 4. They loved the peanut butter sandwiches, ate the meat sandwiches but would eat the peanut butter ones right there and leave both bags. 5. They liked types of nuts, tortillas, cornbread, biscuits, strawberries, apples, oranges, pears, dew berries, Ritz crackers, plain crackers, and cookies. 6. They ate all baked homemade breads, pastries, pies, cake etc. 7. They would not eat any store bought flavored crackers, or flavored chips, they preferred them without flavors. 8. She fixed all sorts of cheeses, meats, raw & cooked and they never left them behind. 9. She left cups of fruits and they'd eat them but left  bananas after squishing in their hand as if not knowing what it was. 10. She started peeling the top about an inch down and they took them. 11. They\u0092d tossed an orange unless it was peeled. 12. Apples were eaten unless they found a rotten one. If badly bruised it would be tossed. 13. She left a tiny, shiny and gold Christmas angel decoration in a tree. It was gone the next day. Her neighbors have a small ranch with a decent sized garden. Many times the creatures would leave return gifts, such as potatoes or tomatoes from that garden. I attempted to talk with the neighbors but they were not home. The location is a rural area surrounded by all types of farms and some orchards.  There are little swamps and gullies throughout the area and two rivers in parallel within 20 miles. Behind their home is a cross section of two gullies that feed into a swamp maybe a half mile south.  There are tall trees and bushes throughout. She would hang the gift bags from a tree limb that hung over a gully.  Since the area is all privately owned I was only able observe and listen overnight.  I did walk along a creek bed and found no evidence but the area definitely has all the resources for these creatures to thrive.  I hung out near the swampy area but had no activity overnight. I did however run into three rattlesnakes in a 45 min time frame before it got dark, also suggesting to me to stay out of the woods that night. The father\u0092s sighting was 8 to 8 1/2 ft tall, dark brown hair about 2-3 inch long all over. No hair at eyes & nose bridge. Dark brown eyes, no neck as if its head was stuck onto shoulders, very long arms hanging down long past waist. Head was rounded and long from forehead up. Was standing still and stared at each other for several minutes, but no aggression, very calm, friendly eyes, no outward seen breasts but presumed female. Seen with full moon straight on and it didn\u0092t run and wasn\u0092t afraid of it. No sound just suddenly gone without noise. Her sighting looked about 8 1/2-9 ft tall. It was hiding behind a huge oak tree where its face was hidden but not its body. She only saw about 9 inches of its side. It had been chunking rocks for 30 mts. playing with her. It was the color of oak bark. Grayish, brownish like the tree. Head was hidden as it was peering from other side of tree. Hairy all over its body on the side, very muscular with  definition on the legs even with hair. Hair looked 2-3 inches but like a wirey hairy teeter dog. No weight guess but she said it was huge, not fat, just hefty and large all over in its bone structure. The side of leg and shoulders looked like an 8 inch tree.  ",
