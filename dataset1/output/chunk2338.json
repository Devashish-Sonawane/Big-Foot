            "Observed": "I am a Missouri resident. Back in 91 or 92 (can't remember which year) I was coming home and coming around a curve when I noticed eyeshine. As I got closer I could see a creature standing on the side of the road, reddish-brown color, at least 8 ft. tall and massive. As the truck lights hit this thing it threw up it's arm and covered it's face. It was not a man in a suit or a bear. When I say massive I mean massive. This thing was anywhere between 600/800 lbs.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Jenny has been a Missouri resident since she was two years old. She and her family have been having sporadic activity for at least 19 years. They say they have had periodic encounters with a family of Sasquatches who live on or very near their property. They live on 119 acres. For years she was hearing all sorts of things she was not familiar with, especially at night. Some were the long \"Ohio howls\". Some were short violent shrieks or screams. Some were whoops and return calls. The individual incidents with sounds are too numerous to mention here. They are ample in number. She and her daughter and husband grew to be cautiously accepting of the sounds, as it didn't involve face to face encounters. Fast forward to 2003. Her mother moved a trailer onto their property so they could be close to her. It was close to their home, about 200 feet or so from door to door. Very shortly after moving in and settling down, something began banging on the side and the door of the trailer at night. It was throwing rocks on the roof of the mom's trailer, and then on the roof of her home she shared with husband and daughter. The family assumed something was not happy about the new living arrangements on the property and they were letting them know about it.  They had a couple of dogs. Every now and then there was a pack of dogs that would come by their property and harass their dogs. Their dogs stayed put but the pack dogs would bark and growl. Her mom came out one night to run off the pack, when she heard clear as day something firmly and loudly began talking toward the pack in an \"animal language\". If an 800 lb. gorilla could speak, that's the sound, she said.                                                     When one of their dogs died, Jenny's husband buried the dog. Her mom planted flowers all around the grave the following year. The next morning they went outside to pay respects and all the flowers had been removed from the holes they were planted in. Each bunch of flowers had been placed next to its hole. No damage to the flowers. They family was floored. She asked me if a Sasquatch would do that. I could only offer conjecture as to why they might want to \"unmark\" a grave site. Here is an example of tracks found on the property. This is a fourteen inch track:The night vision scope event with her husband was important as it finally convinced him that there was something out there in a flesh and blood form. Her description of the creature, down to the height, curvature and length of the arms, is a classic description of these creatures. Her husband, up to that point, had a healthy skepticism regarding their physical existence. He believed his wife was experiencing something. He was also hearing things and seeing some of the peripheral indications up to this point, but for him seeing is believing.  Missouri is the \"Show Me\" state. Now he is as much convinced of what it was NOT as what it was. One cannot argue with seeing it with your own eyes. He was not confused by an upright bear or any other known animal. I spoke with him directly about this particular sighting and he is a no nonsense guy. It was what it was.The witness and her family are devout Christians. At no point during my conversations with them did I get any sense of embellishment. Jenny's husband was clear and methodical about events. That is his nature. They wanted nothing other than to tell their story.___________________________________________________Notes from Matt Moneymaker: The area described in report is a few miles from the Mark Twain National Forest east of Rollo, and a few miles south of the Meramec River.  The BFRO has received other reports from the Meramec River area.  Much of this terrain is karst (limestone) and full of caves, the most famous of which (i.e. most developed) is Onondaga Cave.
