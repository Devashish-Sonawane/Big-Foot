People didn't believe either story. two of my friends were camping by a pond which sets in front of one of the friends house and right acrossed the road from my parents. They were sleeping when a loud noise from their barn woke them. They ran to the house nd woke Daves mom. His dad was at Lake Erie. Dave wanted to get a gun but his mom made them stay in the house. The next day his dad came home and found heavy feed bags torn open and tossed aroudn, broken boards. There were no cattle in the barn.                                          EI YS RY",

            "Observed": "My girlfriend and I were driving home from work in the winter of 2003. We had several inches of snow, so we were moving slow. I was driving down State RT 56.  I looked to the farm field on my left and noticed something walking along the creek. I slowed down to get a better look and asked my girlfriend if she could see what I was watching.  She said yes.  I pulled our truck over as far as I could get and got out.  I walked across the road to get a better look.  What we saw plain as day was covered in reddish brown hair, walked upright, had a conical shaped head, long arms, stocky build and was at least six feet tall.  We watched this thing for several minutes until we had cars backed up.  I got back into the truck and we turned off of the road to the next left where the creek crossed and the ditch turned into a small thicket which is the direction what we both agreed, without a doubt was bigfoot, was heading.  We waited till it got dark to see if anything came out.  Nothing did.  We went to both entrances of the farm fields and saw no tracks of anything.  I am an avid hunter and fisherman and have no trouble distinguishing camoflage from hair at the distance the subjet was from us, which was about two hundred yards.  We only recently told our family and close friends  about what we saw.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with both witnesses and found them to be very credible concerning what they saw that evening.The sighting lasted for several minutes. Based upon the estimate of the witnesses and a topographical map, the sighting started at a distance of about 100 yards and extended out to 350 yards as it walked away up the creek.  The creek generally parallels the road.  The lighting and distance was sufficient to allow them to observe hair hanging from the arms, it was backlit by the sun.  The roadway was slightly above the creek area.Both witnesses were particularly impressed by the ability of the bigfoot to walk unimpeded through heavy snow with a fraction of the effort they believe a human would have exerted.  Weather records indicate that the area received a 10\" plus snowfall with drifting that week.  They stated it did not break stride or struggle at all in making steady progress along the far side of the creek. When asked about the comment about the traffic backing up, the witness stated that because of the snow banks created by plowing they were only able to pull slightly off the road.  This obstructed north bound cars and slowed the south bound cars as he had crossed the road and stood watching.  This resulted in one or two cars needing to wait behind their truck before they could pull around them. This location is within 10 miles of some properties that had consistent activity in the 1980's.

I heard some strange growls and grunting noises, it was a clear night and bright outside. Around 2am i went out with my surefire flashlight and went to the woodline by my side yard and right away smelled a strong almost dead animal smell. I heard brush cracking across my road, I shined my light and seen a set of bright green large eyes. I watched a tall dark brown bipedal creature around 7ft tall cross my road to my side and enter my woods. I backed away as I was a little nervous I went back in my house and heard noises all night. Now i have had other experiences with this creature it has a flat face that is close to a human face for the last ten years. I have known it is here, I think it uses my woods as a travel corridor.",
