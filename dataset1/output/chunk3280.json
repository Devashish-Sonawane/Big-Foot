            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness and her grandmother for 25 minutes, and performed a follow-up interview with her grandmother the following week. Based on conversations that she had with her granddaughter, the grandmother of the witness estimated the heights of the creatures observed as one being between 6.5-7 feet, and the taller one at approximately 8.5 feet. She estimated that her granddaughter had observed the creatures from an approximate distance of 50 feet. She described her granddaughter as being extremely levelheaded for her age, and not one to exaggerate or \"make up stories\", stating \"if that's what she says that she saw, then that's what she saw\". It was noted that the smaller of the two held a rock in its hand. The witness described them as having wide shoulders and long arms. She remarked that they looked \"angry\".Many farm animals are on the grounds including small horses, goats, pigs, chickens and ducks. High Point State Park is close by.",
