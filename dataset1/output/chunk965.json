            "Observed": "Well I live in Rainier WA my name is Matthew I did not see bigfoot but I got some calls or cry's and some hooting. It started one night on 2/4/2011 when I was playing X-box live. I heard this call that I never heard before, so I got out my cell phone and hit record. The next day I was looking on youtube for answers of the call. It was not a fox or a coyote or a dog and too deep for a man. My sister and her friend heard it the same day I got the 1 call on my cellphone. The next night I heard it again, so I got my webcam out the window and record all night long and didn't get anything. On 2/11/2011 I got some more cries on the webcam and 2/12/2011 I heard the cry about 200 yards or closer it gave me goose bumps and made my heart jump 'cause I never heard it so close before. I started to record it but I missed the cry but I got 2 hoots like it is talking to another one. But i hope you guys can help me.  I need some experts to listen to them or I can send them to you guys. All 3 are on youtube.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness Interview.The witness and I talked over the phone. The witness lives near the high school in the town of Rainier, Washington.  He said that the vocalizations came from the south, beyond the high school. He hasn\u0092t heard anything for two weeks now. I asked him how far away he estimated the sounds to be coming from on the first recording. He said 1.5-2 miles away. The second recording was from his webcam recorder which he turned on and just left running. He said that he felt it was real close, maybe only 200 yards away. Considering where he lives and where the high school is, I doubt it was that close. It was probably much closer, but still \u00bd mile away.  I asked him if they went to look at the area where the vocalizations came from and he said yes.  There is timber land across a main road that is in the direction of the vocalizations.  From that road, He knows of an old road that you can walk-in on. He and his friends went in there to look around. They walked the pipeline road down to the Deschutes River, a distance of about one mile.  He said that they found a tree torn out by the roots, stick structures and foot prints with visible toes. The footprints were 16-17 inches long.Field Investigation.On 3-29-11, I drove down to Rainier. I was not able to meet with the witness at this time, but was able to explore the area. If one looks at a Google Earth image of the town, heavy woods are immediately to the south and east of town.  To the northwest is Joint Base Lewis McChord. There is a lot of room for sasquatches to reside in those woods unseen and very close to town. There are also ponds scattered about he area. I located the place where the witness said to walk in. That road is posted. The land is private timber company land and was posted as \u0093no entry without written permission\u0094, so it was not accessible from that side.  I drove around to the far side of this area and was able to find a gated road where non-motorized use is allowed.  I parked there, and walked in about 1.5 miles to the place where the witness said that he found stick structures and tracks. Of course, I was on the opposite side of the river. I found nothing to note, however, the river was high and muddy and there had been flooding, so any tracks from before would have been obliterated. I did find a hidden swimming hole that the local kids know about. This place would be ideal for a sasquatch to hide and watch the teenagers dive and swim. This whole area is perfect habitat for sasquatches. There are ponds, creeks and rivers, very dense forest, easy travel routes, and it connects with extensive forests stretching unbroken for 30 miles without crossing a paved road.The vocalizations.The vocalizations were analyzed by two of our best BFRO audio analysis sources. The frequencies of the vocalizations are a good match for other strongly suspected sasquatch vocalizations. Further, they are very much like recordings that we have posted on our web-site, as well as vocalizations that we have heard and recorded numerous times throughout Washington State.  I have heard similar vocalizations several times. In one of the recordings, there appear to be two individuals. One answers the other. However, the recordings as posted are distant sounding and not of the highest audio quality like one would expect to get from specialized audio recording equipment. That being said, they are very good for recordings from a cell phone and a webcam camera. Our two analysts believe them to be genuine.I believe that it is very probable that this witness was lucky enough to record actual sasquatch vocalizations. ",
