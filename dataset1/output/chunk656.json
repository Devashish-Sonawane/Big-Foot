            "Follow-Up Report": "On the afternoon of January 21, 2010 Steve called from his home on the East Coast and we discussed his sighting back in 1993 at the west end of the Antelope Valley of Los Angeles County.  Steve was very believable and credible in the retelling of him and his friend's Sasquatch sighting during those dark hours as they drove between Quartz Hill and Gorman, California. Steve stated that the moon was out but it still seemed to be very dark in that part of the county as in, not any street lights or house lights were seen in any direction. Both witness were headed west  when they observed this creature approach their vehicle from there right side, jogging along the north side of Highway 138, heading in a south easterly direction, towards the San Gabriel Mountains in the Angeles National Forest, along this highway. This creature came from a desert area that leads up and into the Tejon Ranch. Steve didn't see a wire fence between him and this creature, but only remembers seeing telephone poles on that side of the road. This creature was very tall, with a very thin build including its arms, and it seemed to indicate it had a grayish color covering its body and arms; at first the witness thought it was wearing tattered or torn clothing that seemed to be hanging off of this creature, but as the distance closed, to within approximately 20 to 30 feet, that's when he observed tuffs of hair hanging from its body and arms. He did not see any facial features, or anything else that he can remember now, during his less than 10 second view of this creature. At the time, neither witness knew exactly what they had just viewed, but it scared them both.In Summary: The area where this creature was observed is probably the main corridor for these creatures to travel between Central California Sierra Mountains and the San Gabriel Mountains of Southern California. One more point of interest, these two sailors had a flat tire alongside Quail Lake, which is only a few miles west of where they had the sighting, and they were both too scared to get out to change their flat, so they continued to drove on into Gorman, California; which was about 5 or 6 miles further down the road. Steve estimated the creature's height to be about 7 feet tall, and he estimated the weight to be over 200 lbs.",

            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "On Sunday morning May 11, 2003, early morning, my friend Frank and I arrived at the Stacy\u0092s parents home in Hesperia, Ca. and checked out the area, by sight and sound.  As the sun came up in the east, we started our inspection of the Mojave River area where Stacy had had her first hand observation of the creature back in 1997. Which is about \u00be of a mile from her parents home.  No tracks were observed of the creature, but there were plenty of fresh jackrabbit tracks, with numerous motorcycles and off road vehicle tracks.Later that morning, we made contact with Stacy\u0092s parents, Diane and Steve, where the goose was killed.  Steve showed us to the back yard where there are three horses, with separate stalls, one large billy goat, in his own pen, and a wired chicken coop; top and sides, that has only three chickens in it. The one goose had a pen along side of the chicken coop, with no wire on top of it, and the wired sides were about five foot high. There is a small open shed, at one end where the animals were located, and this is where the animal food is kept, and it would be easy access for any animal to get at, if it were free to roam.The one and only track that was left untouched, was located under a metal bucket lid, and was in very poor shape.  There was no impression in the ground from that track.  That track looked like it could be the fwd part of a foot with some possible toe marking\u0092s, but still very difficult to call it track of any kind.The other signs that were observed, by Stacy and her parents, were in some mashed down weeds, but had no impressions in the ground, and the weeds had already bounced back to their original form, by the time that I saw them.  The chicken coop wire, on top of the coop, which had been partially pulled apart, but had been repaired by the time I observed it. In Summery: The following week I asked our experts, at the BFRO, on what might have killed the goose at Stacy\u0092s parents house in Hesperia, Ca., per Stacy\u0092s description? The answer to that question was; it is a strong possibility that it was just a fox.Made contact with Stacy\u0092s parents about one week after our visit to the Hesperia, Ca., but no new incidents have occurred.  Note: My first contact with Stacy G. was in November of 2002, on report # 5160, which was a class \u0093A\u0094 report, and it took place at this same location during 1997.  .",
