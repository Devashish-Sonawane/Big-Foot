At first I thought I was imagining things but other drivers slowed to look as well. It was about 3:10pm and the weather was partly cloudy, the temp was about 33 degrees and there was a dusting of snow on the ground. The Bigfoot was tall about 9-11 feet if I had to guess and it had broad shoulders and it was brownish grey in color. It was walking east then turned south toward the Grand River. I told others about this and some think I'm crazy and others believe me. I do hope to see it again, I was amazed yet unsettled at the same time.",

There was a field with a wood line, and the animal was just inside the wood line.  He could see it between the trees.  He is not sure of the size but it was larger than a person would be.  He describes the animal as thick. He did see arms and legs on the animal.  He did not notice any distinguishing features of the head, except to say it was cone shaped.The animal then proceeded to the south which is towards the Grand River.  The area has farms, orchards and wineries.  ",
