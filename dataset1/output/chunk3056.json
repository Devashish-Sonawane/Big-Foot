It was about 3 to 4 feet tall, long dark brown to black hair, running on 2 legs. I caught the animal in my headlights very clearly. The one thing we both said was that it was fast. Faster than any animal we have ever seen. It was crossing the road into the swampy area near the small whetstone brook. There were tall reeds there and it disappeared into them. We did not stop. in retrospect, I wish I had. It might have answered some questions we both had.",

The figure that ran across the road was about 3 to 4 feet tall, long dark brown to black hair, 10+ inches long, exceptionally long arms and running on 2 legs, smooth and crazy fast. They caught the animal in the headlights very clearly, the one thing they both said was that it was fast. Faster than any animal they had ever seen. It was crossing the road from the Dollar Store side of the road into the swampy area near the small Whetstone Brook. There were tall reeds in the swamp and it disappeared into them. Being Vermonters all their lives and living in the Green Mountains they have seen all the known critters that call Vermont home, this was none of them. ",

If you were to look at a map you will see a bend in the road. It was between the end of this bend to a mile east of the bend that I saw this creature. I saw it laying in the right lane (my lane) of the two lane highway. After we were driving away I retreated to the south side of the highway. Looking at the south side of the highway there are some trees or woods and brush which is where it was likely heading.",

As my ex-girlfriend and I swerved to the left lane to go around, it got up and watched us drive around it. This thing was HUGE! I'm not exaggerating it had to be close to ten feet tall, with white to grayish colored fur. I watched it watch us drive away in my rearview for about a minute then it ran away on it's legs just like a human. At that time and for a few years after I was in sort of a denial, telling myself it had ot be some kind of Polar Bear that had gotten loose form a local zoo or something. After never hearing any news story about a missing Polar Bear I put in the back of my mind always suspicioning that it may have been a Bigfoot.",
