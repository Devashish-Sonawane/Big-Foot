            "Observed": "My son and I were out fishing one night in July of 2011 at about 1am on friday night at the Matanza bridge back waters, this is on A1A in Florida. at about 2:00 am, we heard this really weird sound of howling and grunts so we sat there for about 25 minutes or so and the sound kept getting louder and closer to where we were parked. My son said to me dad did you see that, I said what and he said something really big was approaching where we were parked sitting in the car. So he winded up the window and said we better leave, so i said no just wait a little bit longer and lets see if it will come back. after about another 10 minutes or so the howling began again but this time it seemed to be more than one howl, as if there was a reply to the deeper howl. So I told him to start the car and lets get out of the area. Well he did so and we were leaving the area and after we traveled about 100 yards or so there it was one of the biggest Bigfoots right in front of us. It was about 9 feet tall really hairy and walking with a slight crouched posture, It was headed East to the ocean. I saw it briefly as we passed to where it crossed the road but it was moving really fast, not running just really long strides. It looked back briefly and went under the bridge and out to the ocean.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with both witnesses, a senior and his 40 year-old son on 2/28/12. The father recalls the sighting like it was yesterday and claims the experience he had with his son was a life changing experience.  Both men claim that until this happened they never believed that Bigfoot existed and admitted they were shocked.  I found both men extremely sincere and credible. They were also very emotional when they each told me their accounts, the father to the point of crying.  The son's emotion contained more excitement and aggression due to the fear that it was a man crawling up to try and kill them. The men fish regularly on Rattlesnake Island, a barrier island that houses a 1700 Spanish fort, between the Intracoastal and the Matanzas River. Part of the island is uninhabited and managed by the National Park Service; the other side has a few luxury homes. The area across the river is prime habitat, the sasquatch may have swam across the river looking for food.Google earth image of the area:The early morning of July 2, 2011, the men arrived to fish. It was a new moon and very dark.  With windows down, and a van \u0093rank\u0094 with food for them and the fish, (bait was shrimp, oysters, mullet, sardines, etc.) the men sat in the car a few minutes discussing the fishing.  Both men heard a loud howl near them, and a faint answer howl coming from across the Intracoastal.  They were unsure of what was making the noise, but assumed it must be a bobcat.  The son noticed movement from the rearview mirror.  He observed a large, dark, hairy covered \u0093Gorilla-man\u0094 crawling on all fours up to the back of the car. The creature knew it had been seen.  Alarmed, the son closed the windows and turned on the light. The creature stood up on two legs and \u0093jetted\u0094 toward the Intracoastal side, where the shore drops down approx. 7 feet.  They heard the howl and answer again. Both men concerned about the strange howls and thinking the \u0093Gorilla-man\u0094 was sneaking up to kill them, thought it wise to leave. The son was prepared to run over the \u0093Gorilla\u0096man,\u0094 but at the same time worried that the size of it would total his van. When driving away, about 100 yards from their parking spot, the headlights landed on a tall, dark brown- haired, biped creature. It was about 50 yards in front of them, standing sideways, looking toward the Intracoastal Waterway. It was obviously wet.  It then turned towards them looking somewhat surprised, then turned again and walked across the road with one step, swinging its arms.  It was then heading toward the Matanzas River. They watched it walk across the flats (it was low tide) and go under the A1A Bridge.  Additional details of its appearance:- It was dark brown and hair appeared to be wet and stringy.- The facial features were more \u0093gorilla\u0094 looking than human.- The arms hung down past its knees.- It did not stand straight up, it had a slouch.- It was over 7 feet tall standing, built solid, approximately 600 lbs.- Had big hands and feet. The soles on the feet were hairless and black.- Facial skin was leathery and dark. No hair was seen on the checks, or around the eyes. Just on the chin.- The nose was flatter than a human.- Seemed to not have a neck. - When it was crawling on all fours, it was larger than a bear. At first the men argued that it could be someone in a costume, but realized that a 7 foot wet costume would not allow such speedy movement. They returned the next morning and the son\u0092s wife found a large footprint. The son wears a size 15 and the print was much larger than his.  It appeared to have a heavy heal in the print. Across the Intracoastal is Matanzas State Forest and Faver Dykes State Park is miles of remote classic Florida marshland and forest. The men have returned to fish during the day, but won\u0092t at night \u0093without an Army.\u0094 The father heard howls at the spot as recent as last month and they came from across the Intracoastal Waterway.
