            "Follow-Up Report": "While visiting relatives in Shaker Heights I took the time to visit the witness, Mr. Ameen who lives outside the nearby community of Chagrin Falls.  He was very personable and he was kind enough to spend some time with myself and Herb Crowther articulating his experiences.  He also shared the similar experiences of some of his neighbors.  Mr Ameen's residence is situated on the edge of a wooded ravine which connects to the sprawling forested ravines and uplands of the of Squaw Rocks Metro Park.  I returned to the area the next day and explored the forested ravine with my brother Richard Powell.  Though we saw no direct evidence of sasquatch activity, we were impressed by the extent of the thickly forested lands that extend for miles from just adjacent to Mr. Ameen's property.  I have personally investigated several situations similar to this in which a rural resident living on the edge of a large forested tract reports bigfoot activity that seems to come from the nearby woods.Assuming one accepts the possibilty of bigfoots checking out homesteads on the rural fringe (as I do), this is just the kind of location where it could easily occur.Mr. Ameen was sincere and credible.  He described efforts he has made to accomodate the possible activity by leaving various edibles in a prominent spot on his property.  We encouraged him to continue these experiments and keep us posted if  the results become interesting.",
