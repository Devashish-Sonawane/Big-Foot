            "Observed": "I arrived at the area at around 2 in the afternoon.  I was in this location because it is an area that I have found signs of interest in the past.  I began my hike down a maintenance road that is gated off to normal traffic.  About a quarter of a mile down the road I dropped off into a dry creek bed to continue to the area.  This creek bed makes for an easy travel rout and is a great place to look for tracks.  After a lengthy walk I climbed out and headed into a dense section of timber and the hillside I was planning on scouting that day.  I slowly worked my way along the hillside in a zig-zaging pattern so that I could thoroughly search the area.  Along the hillside I did find 2 arches, several tree breaks, and an interesting structure of 3 small saplings woven together.  As I continued up the hill my attention was focused on looking for more sign when a very quick sharp noise stopped me in my tracks.  I wasn\u0092t sure exactly what it was that I had herd, but I knew it was out of place.  I was fairly certain that it had come from the top of the hill above me so I stayed in place and focused my attention in that direction.  I stayed put for about 2-3 minutes trying to figure out what I had herd.  As I stood there I began to get that uneasy feeling.  Not fear, but the feeling of being watched, or something being \u0093out of place\u0094.  I decided not to let my imagination get the better of me and began to take a couple of steps farther up the hill, but kept my eyes and ears focused on the crest of the hill.  I had taken no more than 5 steps when the noise came again.  This time I know I herd 2 very distinct, sharp \u0093clacks\u0094.  It was 2 rocks being smacked together.  This obviously stopped me again. I decided to just change direction and head back down the hill and out of the area.",

I find the witness to be credible and very observant of natural phenomena. He has been an avid hunter for many years and has a depth of knowledge regarding the outdoors that is truly impressive. Rock clacking, like wood knocking, is often reported at expeditions and along with possible sasquatch activity.Cardinal Marsh Wildlife Management Area  encompasses 1,171 acres in northeast Iowa, and includes a portion of the Turkey River and a 145 acre marsh. The Turkey River is a clear cold stream that originates a few miles to the west, and is fed by numerous springs. The environment of the management area is diverse, with boggy soils, rocky bluffs and well drained sandy uplands. Old growth forests are present, as well as extensive stands of oak and walnut which are under management to provide habitat for wildlife, maintain the natural beauty of the area and control erosion. Other species common to the area include hickory, maple, cherry, elm, ash and cedar in the uplands, and maple, cottonwood, ash, hackberry and willow in the floodplain. Conifers have been introduced for wildlife habitat.",
