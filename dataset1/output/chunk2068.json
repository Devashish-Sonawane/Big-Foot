            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness over the phone on 6/24/2006. The following can be added:The animal crossed the two-lane road in three steps. It was moving very fast. Although the animal looked like it was running, there was no jerking in the movement. It was fluid and glided very smoothly.The witness visited the site the next day and tried to cross the same road in a sprint and was only able to do it in four and half steps. The witness is 5' 8\" tall. This attests to the size of the animal. The witness estimated the height as approximately eight feet tall. It had a very thick build and massive legs. He described it as twice the size of a good size man.After slamming his brakes,  he could hear the animal crashing through the brush. The next day the witness found a clear path made by the animal. There were no tracks present, just broken brush and trampled grass.The witness's stepfather drew the attached sketch of what the witness saw that night.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness and arranged to meet and drive to the location of the 2012 incident. The witness is currently a Law Enforcement Officer. Judging by the past history of the area and the witnesses excellent recollection of that nights events, it seems very likely that they did in fact encounter a Sasquatch during the night. The evening of the encounter, the witness and a friend had gone to the 'backwaters' of Clendening Lake to fish for catfish. It was around 1 1/2 hrs. after sundown. They built a fire and started fishing. Out of the north in the direction of the Buckeye Trail came a loud scream. Both of them are avid outdoorsman but weren't sure what it could be. The friend thought it could be an owl when moments later, a second scream came from roughly 100 yards to the south which was directly behind them. Unsure of what was going on and thinking the owl had flown over behind them, the witness' friend let out a scream mimicking the sound that they heard resulting in a distant response from the western direction farther down Clendening Lake. After the third scream, they began to hear movement and footsteps in the brush behind them. Then rocks started landing in front of them in the water. They kicked out their fire so they wouldn't be silhouetted by the light as more rocks were being thrown. The witness yelled out that it wasn't funny and someone could get hurt but the rocks kept coming closer so they decided it was time to go. They made it the 40 yards back to their truck when a larger rock landed in Brushy Fork Creek, right behind the truck. They tossed their gear in the back of the truck and got the heck out of there.This area has a history of Bigfoot activity. There are currently two other reports in the BFRO internal database from this same area that have not yet been investigated. There are other reports that had been told to me which the witnesses have yet to report to the BFRO.The local residents refer to Bigfoot as the 'Jimhinker'. Documented reports in local newspapers from the late 1800's to early 1900's told of an screaming animal that was never seen. It killed smaller livestock, stampeded a herd of cattle into the dense brush and scared many hunters out of the woods. They even organized a hunt to track 'the beast of Nottingham Township' down.My ancestors were from that area and my grandparents and parents told us as kids to stay out of the woods at night or the Jimhinker would get you.The Jimhinker lives on today as the name of the counties Historical Society's newsletter. ----------------------------------------------------Note from Matt Moneymaker:Bigfoot researchers in Ohio should make themselves familiar with the path of the Buckeye Trail.  There's a correlation between bigfoot reports and the trail.  Of course, there are many reports in Ohio miles away from the Buckeye Trail, but there's enough very close by (like this report) to suggest that some Ohio bigfoots are utilizing the trail some times. If bigfoots use the trail at night and they spend daylight hours resting in thick brushy zones beside the trail, they can cross much of the state without being seen in less than a week.",
