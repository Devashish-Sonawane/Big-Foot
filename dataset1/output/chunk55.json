            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone. She is an avid hiker, but this was her first year snowshoeing. Her parents live on property that borders the Antoine Peak Conservation Area. The witness and her husband began smelling an odor as if something was dead. She expected to find a dead animal, but rounded a corner in the trail and saw tracks in the snow. The approximate eighteen inch long by eight inch wide tracks were about five feet apart, but lacked detail as they had snow in them. The tracks were aligned, one directly in front of the other, see photos:They followed the tracks for 200 yards. At the edge of a hill, the odor was no longer detected. There was no skid marks in the snow on the slope, but at the bottom were two tracks as if a bipedal animal had landed on both feet. The witness is unsure but estimates it landed twenty five feet below. She also saw another set of tracks where it jumped a second time twenty five feet down to a lower trail. Friends have told the witness there is a cave to the north.I found the witness to be very credible. She mentioned it was unnerving to see what the tracks revealed. ",
