            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness about his report. He is a truck driver and twice weekly drives the particular route on which he had the encounter. It is a midnight run originating in Tyler and concluding in Texarkana. I have driven this very route many times en route for Atlanta, the place where I was born. It was just prior to Atlanta on Highway 59 that the witness saw what he believed to be a bigfoot.  Northeast Texas is a place of many bigfoot anecdotes, so the subject was not unknown to the witness. The witness remarked that upon seeing the animal, although he had always suspected its existence, he then realized that bigfoot was truly no myth. He was amazed that he had been so lucky to have seen what he truly believed was a bigfoot. The witness knows that his report is only anecdotal, and there will be many who will not believe it, but he is unperturbed. In his own words, he knows what he saw. Further, he was in awe and struck by the sheer size of the creature and how it easily cleared the barbed wire fence before walking down the fence line. The way that the animal looked at the witness frightened him. He did remember an eye shine, and described it as a \u0093photo eye shine.\u0094  The witness went on to further describe the creature as being dark in color, and probably a \u0093dark brown.\u0094 The head seemed to be somewhat crested.I inspected the site 11 August 2004, and found no discernable, definitive evidence of a sasquatch. However, there were a couple of indistinct impressions in the soil, and the vegetation along the fence in the vicinity of the crossing had the appearance of having been trampled by something large for a stretch of 100 feet or so. Even though rain had fallen in the area, no distinguishable tracks were found. The general area is indeed one that fits within what is thought to be typical, southern sasquatch habitat. Creeks, marshes, and thick, nearly impenetrable woods surround the location of the encounter. In addition, the Sulphur River is just a few miles north of the site.",
