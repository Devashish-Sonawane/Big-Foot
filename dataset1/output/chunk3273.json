            "Observed": "During the deer hunting season of Nov., 1995 we (my brother, son, and friend) were just getting into our sleeping bags to get a nights rest before our deer hunt the next morning, when a strange sound came from behind my son's tent. It was unlike anything we'd ever hear before in the forest. It was an animal with a deep barreled grunt, and making a shuffling noise as it moved behind the tent. Being an experienced, 50 year old hunter and my brother with even more back-woods experience having heard the noise got up with deer rifles and lights and went to investigate. The animal left the area very quickly, making a loud grunting sound and knocking down heavy brush as it left. We never saw a thing, but it was something we could not identify or explain. We even stayed at camp the next morning to look for sign or tracks to identify the creature. We found nothing, not even a track. Locals say there's a creature in this area (Trinity County, Texas)",

There is a stream that flows through the area and it feeds into the Conococheague Creek about two miles from where the sighting occurred.  The area is very hilly but not mountainous even though there are mountains about 10 miles west of the area near Clear Spring, MD.  One strange thing about this area is that it is where a line runs that divides the limestone ground from shale ground and it is right on our property and just a maybe 150 feet from the sighting.  The shale ground was covered with cedar trees while the limestone ground is covered by Oak and Sycamores for the most part.  The area is near Cedar Ridge Road and along that road there are lots of huge limestones that are visible in the fields and many big sinkholes.  There have been stories that these sinkholes are above caves that run from the Potomac River back under this area.  The Potomac River is close to the area and the Conococheague Creek feeds into the Potoma c at Williamsport, MD which is about 4 miles from the sighting.",
