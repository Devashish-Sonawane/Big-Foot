            "Follow-Up Report": "We believe the witness to be credible and truthful about what he as seen and heard. The witness  is a retired teacher. He explains that he is often awake in the middle of the night and in the early morning.  Over the years he has had many experiences and many unexplainable incidents starting in about 2001. He tells us that most incidents occur between June and November every year. Unusual howls, samurai chatter, strange urine odors, wood knocks, fencing damaged and nineteen inch foot prints in his yard. He describes the samurai chatter as being similar to the sounds found on the BFRO website.For this report we will focus on a sighting in the witness\u0092s front yard by his son-in-law. This sighting was in October of 2006. He works for PUD monitoring the output of river flows. The time of day was evening and it was dark. He was warming up the car for his wife and as he was moving the car around he had a visual sighting in the head lights of the car, of a bipedal creature standing next to a maple tree. It was rocking back and forth. He said the creature had red eyes and was estimated to be over eight feet tall.  The creature turned and ran into the forest.  The son-in-law got out of the car and could hear it running through the forest. Then he could hear it run through water.  When it ran through the water, it echoed. He and the son-in-law retraced its route of travel and the only water they found was inside the very large culvert going under the main road. The culvert is located next to his yard and driveway. This would explain the echo the son-in-law heard. The direction it ran would take it back into the green belt area north of the witness\u0092s yard. The green belt area is a very large piece of private property that remains undeveloped. There is a good food source of berries and salmon in the creeks. There are many tributaries coming through the area from Lake McMurray and into the Pilchuck Creek. Many houses border the area with live stock and fruit trees.",

It sounded close by. Then, we heard a loud crunching, like branches breaking. It couldn't have been a bear, it was too big. In the morning, we saw some footprints by our tent that were about 12-16 inches long. They were much too big to be a bear's. We still dont know what it was, but we are about 90% sure it was Bigfoot.",
