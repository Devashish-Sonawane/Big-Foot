            "Observed": "My boyfriend is a hunter and a trapper. He traps trouble beaver for the county. This was about mid-Aug. He was out checking his traps out on the Chaney Lake Rd., south of Wakefield MI. He was heading south, came around the corner, saw something all black in the middle of the road. Being a bear hunter also, he hurried to see if it was a bear. It stood up on 2 legs looked at my boyfriend, took 2 steps to the west and was into the swamp. It passed in front of a curve sign, going into a swamp, that was 9-10 ft tall and only 6 inches of the sign showed above its head!! It was very black with long arms. So he got down there and it was gone. No path, no broken branches, no noise, nothing.  Now he won't go in woods without a gun. And this is a man that used to bait bear with only a 10 inch knife!!!! And releases wolves, that get caught in his coyote traps!!!  He's seen hundreds of bears and has tracked them in the dark. He said this was NO bear. And he's still rattled about it. We think it was a Bigfoot.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness in length about his sighting. He was driving when he noticed a large dark figure in the road approximately 200 yards down the road. Upon noticing the large, dark figure he sped up to get a closer look. The figure stood up, on two legs looked at the oncoming vehicle, and then covered a distance in two steps that was not possible for a person, or animal for that matter. It headed toward a large clear cut. His initial thought was a bear was in the road. When the figure stood up the witness was positive it was not a bear he saw. An avid hunter who is familiar with the animals in the upper peninsula of Michigan.  The witness noticed that the figure crossed in front of a sign on the side of the rode and recalled only six inches of the sign was visible above the figure's head, making the height in the 8.5 to 9 foot range. Very shaken by the sighting, he thought it may have still been in the vicinity. The girlfriend's mother has property that has had activity in the form of howls and strong odors outside the mobile home. This was unknown to them both until they shared his sighting with the family.
