            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. His description of the terrain matches what I could see on Google Earth. The water described was an inlet creek coming from the east that passed under a rural road and emptied into a large farm pond west of the north/south oriented road. The pond was obscured from view by trees and terrain. The creature came from the southeast to witness\u0092s right and was heard but not seen for 4 to 5 minutes, being obscured by trees. It was about 40 feet away when it cleared the trees and came into view. Even though it approached within 20 feet, it never reacted to presence of the witnesses in any way. He estimates that it was in view for 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing in the woods on the other side of the creek. Due to the light conditions and shock of his sighting, the witness could not provide other details other than its massive size and that it appeared to have a round head with no visible neck. He said that the creature was in water about mid-calf deep, the water was 3 to 4 feet below his feet on the road, and that its head was level with his head as he stood looking at it.I found the witness to be very sincere, consistent, and credible in describing his encounter. At the time of his sighting, he had no familiarity with Bigfoot and could not wrap his mind around what he had seen. After that night, he never spoke with his mother about what they had seen. It was only after watching an episode of \u0093Finding Bigfoot\u0094 that he began to realize what he may have experienced.",
