            "Observed": "About 10 years ago, in the Upper Peninsula of MI in pine and hardwoods country (mixed) I was riding my white gelding, SILVER just before dusk.  I was about 1 1/2 miles from my camp, when Silver stopped dead in his tracks on the dirt road we were on, and stared into the woods.  I looked in the direction his head was turned and to my surprise, I saw a tall white animal coming towards us at a quick speed.  It almost looked like my horse, coming at us!  IF I wasn't riding him at the time, I would have thought he got lost and it was him running towards me.  All of a sudden, the animal came within about 30 yards from us, stopped and turned to go sideways... running behind some pine trees.  HE just disappeared!!!  I didn't see him come out of the other side, go back, nothing. JUST GONE.  I was quite scared at the time, and real excited, too.  I was too scared to go into the woods to find where it went, or what it was for that matter.  I had white hair, looked like a horse standing tall, looking at me, but when it turned sideways, to run, there was no large body behind it.  IT looked like an upright animal running.  IT was totally silent, with no noises even though he was running through the trees, and in a very heavey blue berry patch area.  THE area has since been logged off in that stretch, and I know my kids saw something running in the woods the same summer while 4-wheeling.  We made a big joke about our albino sasquatch, and to this day, I do believe I saw something real remarkable.  I tell my story, and they laugh at me, but I know what I saw, and my horse saw it too.  HIS reaction was quite extraordinary.  I think what ever the animal was, it thought Silver was one of them.  HE looked so similar in the woods, til he turned and there was no body behind it.  I never reported it to any officials here as there isn't anyone to report it to.  Thought of calling the DNR about it, but I swear my family teases me terrible so I know I would get ridiculed about it if I went too public.  Everyone at camp knows of this though and I do tell it often.  I know it was something unique for me to witness.  We have a large wooded area in the U.P. where our camp is, with very rugged terrain.  Many bluffs are located in this area, and one large ridge runs behind where the animal was observed.  I have not seen this since that summer, and no one other than my children and their friends have reported any such sightings that I know of.  It has always bothered me I didn't go and investigate further.  BUT the primal fear I felt in me was something I have never dealt with and I just couldn't do it.  I don't know if this is worth telling you now, since the area was logged and it was so many years ago, but I guess I am wondering if anyone else has ever reported anything so bizarre... especially it being all white like that.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness insists that the animal she saw was white and every bit as tall as the horse she was riding.  She estimates that the creature changed course and fled at a right angle to her direction of travel only after closing to a distance of twenty feet ahead of her.  The creature was described as moving quickly and noiselessly until the moment at which she suddenly lost track of it's whereabouts.  There was little understory vegetation, mostly consisting of low ferns, and the trees were estimated to be 6\" in diameter, which is typical of jackpine stands of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.  Witness was sober and serious in her description and is at a loss to explain how the animal was able to suddenly conceal it's whereabouts under such circumstances.  Witness turned around and left the scene in great haste and did not investigate further.  Witness has since returned to the site and observed that the site has been commercially logged since her sighting.Further communication from witness:Thom,Even though this was years ago, I remember it likeyesterday, because it was so bizzarre. When Silver put his head up to see the creature comingtowards us, I felt the creature thought Silver was oneof them, as he came right towards us, not noticing meon his back, I am assuming.  Kind of led me tobelieve there were more of them in the area, and whitetoo.... The pine forest he was in was tall, thinjackpine, but quite thick.  When it came inreal close to where I was, he must have noticed weweren't familiar to him, and he turned, runningsideways towards some trees.  All of a sudden, he justdisappeared.  HE didn't come out on the other side ofthe tree, but just vanished.  I was thinking he couldhave run back straight, but the trees weren't thatlarge to where his whole body could hide behind it, andit was strange I didn't see him running away from meat all... just sideways, then behind the tree andgone.  I guess that is what gave me the creeps morethan anything else I observed.  Like I said before, itwas going on dusk, and even though there wassufficient daylight for me to venture in a ways, I wastoo scared to do it.  IT was totally silent, too.  Ididn't hear it breathe, break twigs, nothing...justquiet woods...which was another thing that bothered me. KnowingSilver stopped dead in his tracks to watch this thinggave me comfort as I know even though there wasn'tanother human observing this thing, Silver did see it,too.  I have seen albino deer and honestly thought that iswhat I thought it was BUT when there was no large body jutting outbehind it, I knew it was something all togetherdifferent.  I tell everybody I saw an albinosasquatch, as I can't explain it any other way.  Itruly believe I saw something very unique, and havesince looked into the site and read the other U.P.sitings stories.  Nothing else seems to be like mysiting, though.  There was one in Marquette countyyears back, though.... maybe only footprints andstrange sounds?  not sure, and I guess it doesn'tmatter.  My family teases me, but I know what I sawand no one can convince me otherwise...Sincerely,V.O.",
