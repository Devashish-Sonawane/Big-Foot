            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and visited the location of his sighting. In addition to his report, he provided some additional details and information about both the reported sighting and a previous sighting. He believes that the figure was closer to 1/8 mile on the west side of the river from his position on the bridge rather than 1/4 mile stated in his report, and the duration of the sighting was closer to 2 to 3 minutes rather than 5 minutes. He said the figure always had its back to them and never looked back toward them. He described the figure as a uniform dark chocolate brown color, very tall, and hairy. His other sighting occurred in March/April of 2016 while he worked as a water truck driver, delivering water to oil drilling sites. While filling up at a well south of Lipan, Texas at about 2:30 am, he said he felt like he was being watched and initially saw yellow eye shine illuminated by his powerful spotlight from a wooded area about 1/4 mile away. Losing sight of the eye shine, he continued his work. The next time he noticed the eye shine, it was about 75 yards from him and he could see it came from a massive upright creature 7-8 feet tall with a huge head and no neck. He immediately packed up his gear and jumped in his truck. On the way out of the property, he attempted to catch the creature in his headlights, but it had gone. On two previous night visits to this site, he had smelled a powerful odor and again smelled the odor during the same visit as the sighting. He said that he was very frightened by this experience and has refused to visit that well site at night again.I visited the location of the bridge sighting and found it to be as the witness described. I could see the river and large sand bars for about 1/2 mile before it disappeared in a westward bend. The west side of the river was dense uninhabited forest, while the east side appeared to have a private park with several structures before merging into more forest. I spoke with the resident of the property and his adult daughter and told them about the sighting. Although they said they hadn\u0092t noticed anything abnormal, they seemed very receptive to the possibility and promised to contact me if they heard or saw anything.The Brazos River and its tributaries have had a long history of bigfoot encounters and this witness, because of his work and knowledge of this part of Texas, has extraordinary familiarity with the land and its inhabitants. I found the witness to be very sincere and truthful in describing his sighting. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, whom I will call John, at length over the phone.  He was also kind enough to give me exact coordinates so I could look at the entirety of the area via Google Earth.  It was a good conversation that added much to the initial report.   Interestingly, the Google Earth picture was taken only about 1 month after the incident. John and his dog were on the front porch looking to the south.  It was dusk but not yet dark.  There are a lot of deer in the area and he heard a doe and a couple of yearlings coming fast from behind the east side of the house.  On that side there is some cover of about 60 trees between his house and the neighbor\u0092s house.  They seemed to have been spooked.  John watched them and his dog did not even react.  Then he started to hear bipedal footfalls on the west side of his house.  They were not exceptionally loud.  On the west side is his dirt driveway and a tree between his house and the neighbor\u0092s house.  Then he saw what \u0093looked like a really tall person\u0094 walking rapidly.  This shocked him as there is not much of anything directly behind his house and especially behind his westerly neighbor\u0092s house for several hundred yards except woods.  So there was no logical explanation as to why someone would be walking there. John said it was dark enough that the creature was silhouetted and more of a shape.  It was not light enough to make out much detail.  The creature put its right arm on the top of a 6 foot high fence post and stepped over the fence with no problem.  The fence itself is not 6 feet high, but the hand placement is interesting.  It then crossed a small pasture area went over another fence and headed in the direction of where the deer went slightly west of the exact path they took.  What really shocked John was how quickly and in how few steps it crossed the approximate 2 acre area of his front yard. John stood up to watch the creature and his dog stood up but had no other reaction.  As John started to process what he just saw he thought about the hand on the fence post.  At first John thought that meant it had to be 7 feet tall.   John went out the next morning to try to better understand what he saw.  He focused on the fence post.  He remembered that the creature did not reach up to put its hand on the fence.   After thinking about it more, he started to realize it had to be taller than 7 feet simply because of the post.  Part of John\u0092s job is to be able to judge the weight of people and he is quite accurate at it.  His immediate estimation was at least 500 lbs.  He said it looked like a person that was wearing a really thick down coat.  It was massive but proportionate to the rest of its body.   He said the creature walked with determination.  It was focused on the deer.  It never looked in any other direction.  It even crossed the road as if there were no road as in not looking left or right. Here is what is interesting to me.  As you look at the area from Google Earth.  The closest cover is actually behind his west neighbor.  John\u0092s back yard backs up to cover but it is farther away.  We both agreed that the most logical explanation is that the squatch had spooked the deer.  Assuming it did it in the closest cover, it would have been behind the neighbors.  The deer went around to the cover on the east side and then headed south as across the road there is even more cover.  The squatch, however, was not like most predators.  Most would have followed the deer\u0092s path.  It didn\u0092t.  Instead it went on the west side of the house cutting off quite a bit of distance and had almost no cover it had to navigate.  It was a straight path with no obstacles,    John has run this event over and over in his mind.  Like many witnesses he is still trying to come to grips with what he witnessed.  At one point, he asked what I thought.  I simply said, let\u0092s look at this logically assuming everything you said regarding height and the fence post is accurate (which I firmly believe John is telling the truth), how many 7\u00926\u0094 to 8 foot tall or taller people do you know exist?  And those that do exist are they over 500 lbs in weight?  And of those people, how many do you think would be walking out of dense cover down your driveway, across a road without looking, at almost dark after deer?He laughed and said, that is what I had come up with too, but I just needed some agreement.
