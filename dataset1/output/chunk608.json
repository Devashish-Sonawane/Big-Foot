            "Observed": "My son and I were going north on FM 1997 outside of Marshall, Texas heading to Lake O' the Pines for New Year's party. We saw something that appeared to be a very large man with a brown fur coat on. It was a mostly wooded area but the thing was just off the road approximately 8 feet. The highway right-of-way was cleared about 20 feet to wooded areas on both sides. A small creek ran a few feet north of where it (the creature or ?) was. It looked like it was kneeling possibly on one knee facing away from us. I slowed the car when we first saw it. We said to each other \"what was that?\" We discussed going back to get a better look but decided against it. The next morning we went back to the spot to see if maybe someone had left a large object on the side of the road, but found nothing.",

We found a power line right of way intersecting with the road at an angle and a peach orchard across the road. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness (Abe) at length over the phone.  Although the encounter took place many years ago, Abe recalls clearly what took place and how he perceived the creatures reacted during their encounter with him.  Upon first seeing the creatures, both had just entered the road he was traveling on at the apex of a turn to his right.  Beyond this point, about a quarter mile or so, was a construction crew conducting needed road repairs due to recent storms.  Although these creatures weren\u0092t able to make visual contact with the road crew, they acted as though they needed to be aware of their presence as well as Abe\u0092s approaching vehicle.  This seemed to cause them great concern for their safety since they both kept turning their bodies both ways in an effort to see in both directions.   This is when Abe noticed their exaggerated movements and how their upper body almost needed to face the direction they wanted to see.  Each time the creatures were facing away from him, Abe noticed how the upper body and head appeared to resemble that of a grayish black gorilla.  During the whole time Abe kept trying to discern some resemblance of clothing, to no avail.  It wasn\u0092t long before the shorter one moved closer to the left shoulder of the road and then leaped out of sight!  The larger of the two hesitated as though to \u0093play safety\u0094 for the other, not knowing what was about to happen with the oncoming vehicle.  By now Abe was close enough to verify that once the remaining creature had started moving in a deliberate manner to leave the road. He then saw it leap into the brush and noticed how they needed no forward momentum but could leap from a mere stand-still.  Abe Later investigated the area and determined that the creature had to have leaped a distance of around twenty feet and at a height of about 5\u0092-6\u0092 off the ground. I questioned Abe on how he had decided one was male and the other female. Abe answered, \"the animal seemed to act submissive\".  I asked which one and he said, \"the one slightly behind the other\".   He went on saying how it had a more female shaped body, slightly wider at the hips and a little shorter.  The male,  the one in front, seemed to be more in charge...  more assertive....  He said that his suspicion was reinforced by how the larger one in front delayed it's \"leap to safety\" and paused long enough to stop anyone or anything (the vehicle) from following them.  I found that to be the most interesting aspect of this sighting.",
