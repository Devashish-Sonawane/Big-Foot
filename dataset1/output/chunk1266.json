            "Follow-Up Report": "I was contacted around 1330hrs by the landowner who said she had sixteen tracks in the mud of a possible Bigfoot that a logger had seen, as well as some hair.  I advised her to cover the tracks with something to protect them from being damaged in the possible rain that was forecast for that day.  I arrived around 1530hrs that afternoon and began investigating the site. The Rapides Sheriffs Department and the Wildlife and Fisheries had already been there.  The RPSO had already taken a track cast of track number seven(right).  What I found were sixteen tracks that traveled forty-seven feet southeast. I casted tracks number four (left), number thirteen (right), and number fourteen (left).  I also received black hairs from a log the creature had been next to.  I returned on Friday the 25th around 0800hrs and continued my investigation.  I measured the distance from the first track to the last track again.  I also measured the distance between each track.  I found between track number eight and track number nine a distance of seven feet.  There was hard ground between these tracks.  I also made a detailed drawing of the area showing all measurements and directions of travel.  I noticed that in a couple of the tracks it appeared the creature had used its toes to push off in the mud.  I interviewed both witnesses several times and found no deviation from the original telling.  Several photographs were made of the area as well as of the casts and hair samples.  The hair was sent out to be analyzed by the BFRO and was determined to be bovine(livestock) hairs, which are not uncommon in the area.  The tracks measured 14.5 inches in length, heel width was four inches, and the ball of the foot was seven inches wide.  The tracks also had only four toes.  The tracks were a maximum of two inches deep into the muddy areas.  The measured stride from left heel to right heel was three feet five inches, and the left heel to left heel measurement was six feet six inches.  Further investigations have been made and are ongoing.",
