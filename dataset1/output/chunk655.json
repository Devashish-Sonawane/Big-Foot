As we neared the end of the road, within sight of the farm-road, a large, solid-black animal came out of the woods on the east side of the road, walking slowly on two legs. It was between 7-8 feet tall, and solid-black. It looked like it had a healthy-weight, more than a human. Definitely not a black bear! It appeared trim and muscular, with it's long arms hanging down past it's knees. It's upper-profile reminded me of \"Homer Simpson\" (best description I can think of). The thing was about 20ft. from the front of the pick-up, causing me to come to a stop. It knew my truck was there, but it continued it's slow pace, seemingly without care.",

As they were heading back to the hard road a large creature stepped out into the road about 20 feet way, visible in his dim parking lights.It came out from the east side of the road. It's eyes seemed to reflect the light of his parking lights. He said it seemed all dark colored except for its face. It seemed to have some grey hair around the eyes and mouth as if it might be older. It gave the impression of total indifference to the vehicle. It was hunched over and shuffling along, no hurry. ",
