Her sighting only lasted about ten seconds or so, but she got a good close-up look at the creature as she was driving by. As soon as it heard the vehicle, it turned around and stared at her with a surprise look on its face. She noticed the large black eyes more than anything concerning the facial features. The hair on its head was red. Then the creature crouched down behind a small tree to conceal itself, but the witness said she could still see the long arms with the big legs. It was big and musclular. ",
