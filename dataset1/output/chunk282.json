            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for about thirty minutes. As stated, he was going hunting with his girlfriend. He was a couple of miles from the nearest dwelling. From atop a landing area, above a clear cut, he began to hear a loud banging sound. His immediate reactionary thought was hammer on wood. BANG, BANG, BANG. Three loud sounds in a row. The sounds were coming from the creek bed below, in a stand of timber. He estimates, the sounds were coming from at least 1/4 of a mile away. That is when it hit him, the context was wrong. People shouldn't be hammering on wood out here at this location. Nobody should be down there unless it was another hunter, in which case, he wouldn't be hammering on wood announcing his presence. So now the witness was a little on edge. He was wearing a bright hunters orange vest. His gun was visible when he ventured down into the clear cut. As he moved the area was quiet but when he came to a stop. BANG, BANG, BANG, he heard the loud sounds again. It was the same rhythmic pattern. After listening a brief moment he continued moving forward. Coming to a stop to scan the hill, he heard it again. BANG, BANG, BANG. This time he could feel the hair on the back of his neck stand up. He got all tingly with an overwhelming feeling of Dread. He realized that he could not stay here and had to leave. He felt he was in flight or fight mode and made a hasty retreat up the slope back to his truck.When he got back to his vehicle he was ready to go. He got the feeling he was under surveillance or being watched. For some reason this scenario was unsettling for him. This was the first time this has happened to him in all the years he has hunted.
