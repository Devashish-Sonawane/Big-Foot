Left my car about 0700 and crossed over a dirt berm that had been pushed up blocking another service road. Thought it would be as good a place to do some research on a book that my son is encouraging me to write. Had hiked about 1000 feet when I spotted what appeared to be deer tracks heading over the road and down into the ravine, took a few photos and went down into the ravine. About 200 feet down I lost the tracks and noticed my battery on my camera was almost dead, searched my pack, like a dummy I had left it back in my camera bag in the car. As I started back up in the direction of the car I heard 2 loud wacks of wood on wood about 6 or 7 seconds apart and about 300 feet above and to the right of me.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a crime scene investigator, has done wildlife research, and has extensive experience in the outdoors.  He has had a number of experiences that cannot be explained by known wildlife, but remains somewhat skeptical of other explanations.On October 19, 2014, he drove up past the Loup Loup Campground, on a forest service road, to cast deer tracks for his collection.  He reported seeing four or five deer while driving and three while hiking that day.  The location is a temperate forest, of light to moderate density, in mountainous terrain.  It was a clear fall day with no wind and the temperature was around 36\u00b0F.  There was some frost in places.The hunting season had just started, but there were only a few hunters, and he reported that he heard no shots.  He parked at a side road where it is blocked by a berm.  He walked over the berm and down the road into a ravine about a mile.  The dirt on the berm was a little soft and he could see some old boot tracks, but there were no vehicles or hunters in that area.  The witness noticed a \u0093pungent, slightly irritating smell, a kind of light cesspool/sulfur\u0094 odor, around the berm area.  \u0093It was not real pronounced and I couldn\u0092t identify where it was coming from and there was no breeze.\u0094  He recalled sensing a similar odor while hiking on the Pacific Crest Trail, but also could not identify the source at that time.  Other than that, he only noticed \u0093the usual forest smells\u0094 while hiking in the ravine. The witness reported hearing a \u0093fairly large crashing\u0094 sound above him while listening for deer, but \u0093really couldn\u0092t distinguish what it was.\u0094  He was using a parabolic mic to listen to the deer, but they made very little sound.When his camera battery ran low, he headed back toward his vehicle and discovered a line of large tracks on the road which were not there before.  There were five tracks on the side of the road.  The size, spacing, and gait pattern was not human. He has investigated many human tracks.  The tracks were 18 inches long, broad and flat, and the toe impressions were visible.  The width at the ball of the foot was 7 \u00bd inches, and the width across the heel was 5 inches. The toe to heel spacing between steps was 44-48 inches.  The tracks were straight forward, not angled like human tracks, and were in a straight line.  The witness is 6\u0092 2\u0094 and was not able to duplicate the depth of the tracks on the road.  He even tried jumping next to the tracks to make a deeper impression.  He also could not duplicate the stride, although he admitted he may have been able to if he was running.  The tracks turned off the road and down into the brush.  He could see where the brush had been disturbed as something passed through it.  He took a number of photographs and cast the best track.He did not report any unusual odor or sounds in the area of the tracks.  He is very familiar with the scent of bears and of tracks made by known wildlife.  If someone else was in the area, he would have heard their vehicle.The witness reported that this is the first time he has come across such possible sasquatch tracks.  He was still not sure what to think of them.  He questioned why someone would be walking barefoot in the mountains on a cold day.This witness works in law enforcement and goes out of town on extended missions, so follow up has taken time.  He took  me to the location on May 17, 2015.  The side road follows a ridge above a creek about a mile out.  We found sasquatch sign (old tracks) all over the area.Loup Loup Pass is a mountain pass in the Cascades. A small ski area is located at the pass.",
