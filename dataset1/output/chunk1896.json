            "Observed": "It was January 2005 and I was living in Job, WV with my daughter who was five years old at the time. I was renting the house which was a little ways from the road. It was about 3:30pm and I was walking down the long drive way to meet my daughter to get off the school bus. It had been snowing the night before and it was cold out with a few flurries. Well as I got to the end of the drive way the bus came and stopped and I went across the street to get my little girl off the bus and I turned around and at first was talking to my daughter I didn't look straight ahead in front of me but when I looked up I noticed a very large brown figure standing below my porch which was second story and as I walked up holding my daughter's hand it just stood there staring at first I couldn't figure out what it was I have been in WV all my life and had seen many bear, bobcats and even a cougar. So I knew this was not any of these and it was standing at least eight foot tall with man like features it had kind of a flat nose its eyes were shaped like an owls and it blinked several times it didn't move the whole time we were walking to the other side of my porch to go up the steps. In fact we even looked down on it from the upstairs porch. My daughter threw some pebbles down and it still didn't move we didn't stay outside to see when it walked off but I will never forget what I saw I haven't seen anything else like it since.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness several times on the phone about her report. She was very sincere and eager to talk to someone about this incident.          The area around the home is heavily wooded with an old road leading up the mountain behind the residence. This creates easy access to anything wanting to come around for a closer look. The modular home sets on an eight foot block basement with pines lining the entire length of the house.She described the creature as being as tall as the pines it was standing behind, approximately seven to eight feet in height. It had dark round eyes with a heavy brow ridge, a cone shaped head, broad shoulders, long arms and appeared very muscular. The hair was dark brown to black and matted. She also noticed a pungent odor like a dead animal. She stated she had smelled this around the home before, along with hearing knocks and whoops from the mountain side behind the house on several occasions. She described the skin on the face as dark with some hair on the facial area. The lips were thin but it never showed its teeth. She stated that she did not feel threatened at all by the creature but, she had no desire to go back outside to see which direction it went upon leaving, to look for tracks or to take a picture even if, she had a camera. She could not believe what she had just seen! It snowed that night covering up any possible evidence of tracks.I told the witness that we are learning from other reports that they are attracted to children and seem less threatened by women than men. While up close daylight sightings are rare, it is not out of the realm of possibility that the creature had been observing them and possibly wanted a closer look and simply froze on being discovered in hopes they would not notice it. The view from the road to where the Bigfoot was standing was partially obscured by her daughter's playhouse and a few smaller trees. Her daughter, while only five at the time, remembers the incident and was commenting in the background while we spoke on the phone. I received photos of the house and yard but will not post them here for the owner's privacy. ",

The report appears to be credible.These two friends have hiked many a trail, and they were baffled at the sound of vocalizations they heard that night. After BBQ steaks and packing up to head out, they heard a shrill yell followed by low howl. The sound came from across a creek, up on a small ridgeline 200 yards from them.Around 3-5mins later another similar type of yell came out of the brush 100 yards behind them in the opposite direction. This yell was more deep, resonating, breathy, and had a growling sound to it.Neither witness could identify the call, but recalled it being very similar (but not exact) to one found on the BFRO website. The one witness who used to do solo overnight hikes will not go adventuring alone anymore. ",
