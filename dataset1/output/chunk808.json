The rock throwing began shortly after hard rainfall commenced; all members of the group were accounted for.Screeching screams, sounding like a woman in pain but much louder, were heard about ten times throughout the night. SF did not initially relate these events to bigfoot activity until later, when he heard possible bigfoot recordings on the Internet. No unusual smells were noted.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness, as well as his son for over an hour.  This witness is a very experienced hunter specializing in hunting with muzzle loading primitive firearms.  His style of slow, careful hunting makes him more aware of the wildlife and conditions around him than most people.  He is a careful observer of what is going on in the forest around him.  He knows the wildlife and the tracks they make, including bears, so he is not one to be fooled.  His description of the track, the size, width and clear toes fit with other observed large humanoid footprints found by this investigator as well as others.  The stride length is longer than typically reported, but then the creature could have been running.  That he found clear tracks on two successive days, as well as hearing a loud wood knock, lead me to conclude that this was an encounter with a sasquatch.There have been many reports of sasquatch sightings in this part of the state.  The behaviors reported were similar to what this witness reported.  Further, the close proximity of the lava beds means that there is a source of shelter.  This area has a good population of deer, elk, and other wildlife which would provide a good food source.  At this time, the area is snow bound, so an on-site investigation is not possible.  This area would be a good place for further study in the late spring and summer.",
