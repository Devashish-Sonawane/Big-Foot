            "Observed.1  ": "These meetings were often a Sumerlin family reunion of sorts.  Wes Sumerlin spent most of his life in the Blue Mountains, trapping, tracking and recreating with family. He had many stories of personal Bigfoot encounters and compiled a well-worn photo album of tracks and hair gathered in his quest of Bigfoot. Members of his family and others who had experiences attributed to Bigfoot around the area congregated to share their thoughts. The Sumerlin patriarch died in 1999, and the weekly meetings slowed. At a recent gathering Wes\u0092s widow Natalie (aka Pee-Wee), his daughter Carol Smith and grandson Jonathan Sumerlin met with Orchard, former Dayton game warden Bill Laughery, Brian Smith, the Walla Walla representative of the North American Ape Project and Sheryl Jenkins, an equestrian with a cabin on Stewart Ridge overlooking the Mill Creek watershed. The group looked over plaster casts and photos as they recalled their initial Bigfoot encounters. Even growing up with Wes Sumerlin\u0092s stories didn\u0092t make immediate Bigfoot believers out of some of his family members. Jonathan Sumerlin was a teenager in the early 1990s when on a family outing at Timothy Meadows (a couple miles northeast of Jubilee Lake), his grandfather turned up a 71/2-foot grassy area that appeared to be a bedding spot, as well as large tracks right around where group members had been.  \u0093That was my first experience, and that\u0092s where I became an absolute believer!\u0094 Sumerlin said. \u0093I thought it was a campfire story grandpa told until then.\u0094  \u0093You always had five to ten percent doubt, even as dad\u0092s daughter!  The first time you see one it\u0092s a shock,\u0094 Carol Smith said of her encounter with a Bigfoot a couple years ago. \u0093I now maintain that Bigfoot is alive and well!\u0094   Brian Smith was new to the area when he says he saw Bigfoot crossing the road while in the Blue Mountains.  Now, Smith is spearheading an effort to capture proof of Bigfoot on film with motion-detecting cameras and other technology.  Cheryl Smith reports she\u0092s spotted Bigfoot while riding horses around her cabin on Stewart Ridge three times, and feels it takes experience to spot them.  \u0093We figure they were there before us, and if you really don\u0092t know it\u0092s there, I really believe you can walk right by one unless they move,\u0094 she said.  \u0093Spotting them takes time.  You need to know how they move.\u0094 Laughery. Now of West Richland, spent years in the Blue Mountains in his position as a game warden, and was not a Bigfoot believer until he, Freeman and Wes Sumerlin say they ran into three of them on Biscuit Ridge south of Dixie.  He since had several other sightings and Laughery still takes excursions into the Blues to show where reported sightings have taken place.  He said signs that a Bigfoot is in the area is that there are no wildlife sounds, and there is a pungent odor. \u0093They\u0092re extremely hard to see,\u0094 Laughery said on a recent return trip to the area where the trio had its experience.  \u0093One jumped fifteen feet in front of Wes,\u0094 he said.  \u0093And got within 200 feet of me Then that thing somehow disappeared.\u0094 Laughery recalls seeing Bigfoot in a clearing in the bottom of Dry Creek Canyon as well as spotting tracks that he followed for miles in the fields around Mill Creek. And there\u0092s something he feels strongly about following his encounters. \u0093They\u0092re thinking animals,\u0094 he said.  \u0093I think one was trying to communicate with me.\u0094 Orchard, who has written about a dozen other books on his various experiences around the Walla Walla Valley, said he plans to continue following the Bigfoot phenomenon.  He says questions of why more people don\u0092t see Bigfoot is easily explained. \u0093I don\u0092t know how many other people see them and don\u0092t want to report it,\u0094 Orchard said. He says polls taken 20 years ago indicated 10 to 15 percent of people believed in Bigfoot.  Now, that estimate is up to 40 percent.  And, Orchard says, most people don\u0092t spend as much time in the Blue Mountains as some of those who report seeing Bigfoot. \u0093If you go fishing a lot you\u0092re going to catch more fish than if you go once a year,\u0094 Orchard said.",

            "Observed.1  ": "He said the weather was clear and there was no obstruction. All four spoke very emphatically about what they had seen, and the four, interviewed separately as couples, reported seeing exactly the same things and described in detail what the creatures looked like and their actions. \" These things, whatever they were, walked and ran on only two legs. They had arms, legs and bodies much like a human but covered with hair. Only their hands and feet did not have hair,\" they said. \"They were profile to us much of the time and there is no question about them having only two legs - but their legs and arms appeared to be out of proportion (larger) than those of humans. \" Two of them would romp and play in the meadow while a third stood some 100 yards away at the edge of the meadow near the point of a cluster of pines. The three were in perfect view all of the time except for a few seconds when two of them disappeared into a wash, but returned again to the meadow. \"They could not have seen us as we were above them on a ridge, somewhat secluded. When they would run, they would take tremendous strides and would cross a 100-yard clearing in rapid speed. \" They could not have been bears or other animals. We don't know what they were but they were something that we have never seen before. They did not have pointed snouts as bears do and we had a good, long look at their profiles.\" Sergeant Rosenberg said he has hunted wild game for more than 25 years around the world and \"these were nothing like anything I have seen before, in real life or otherwise.\"  The beasts were described as being 8 to 10 feet tall with much broader shoulders than humans with distinct necks, arms, hands, legs and bodies much like humans. \"It's hard to judge our exact distance but I know that if they had been elk, I could have killed them with my high-powered rifle that has a telescopic site. We were that close,\" said Sergeant Rosenberg.  They agreed that although they had the appearance of humans, they did not act like humans. \"They had animal-like characteristecs and there was no sign of human shelter that we could see.\" Sergeant Rosenberg said the \"things\" had rounded heads, but they could no distinguish facial details. They walked upright, not even in a crouch. They never were on \"all fours.\"  The sighting was on July 10, but the four never discussed the matter further among themselves or with anyone. The Melkas never even told their children and the Rosenbergs told their family only that they had seen something strange while in the Uintas. \"We thought a lot about it, but didn't want to talk about it and be humiliated by those who wouldn't beleive us,\" said Mr. Melka.  Sergeant Rosenberg said that when the first sightings were reported last weekend by Jay Barker and his party from North Ogden, \"we decided to tell the world what we had seen earlier in the month in the same general area of the primitive Uintas.\" The sighting by the Davis County couples was about one-half mile southwest of Elizabeth Lake, about 17 miles northwest of where the Barker group saw their \"beast.\" \" It's a very primitive area, about 18 miles from the nearest road,\" said Sergeant Rosenberg. \"We had taken a four-whell drive jeep into the area looking for a suitable sight for an elk camp in late September. We stopped and walked to the ridge to look into the lake area. \"Pat (Mrs. Rosenberg) was the first to catch the creature out of the cornerof her eye. At first we were shocked at the huge size of these things but then we became intrigued and just stood and watched them. We weren't scared, but we were apprehensive.\"  They said that as luck would have it, they left their rifles, binoculars and, of course, cameras at home. \"Had we been better armed (they had two pistols), we would have searched for the creatures,\" said Mr. Melka. \"But we weren't about to go in on foot after them with what we had.\"  Sergeant Rosenberg said he is going back into the area this weekend bow hunting - but will probably take a rifle and camera along. The four will return there about September 26 for the elk hund and \"plan to camp at the exact spot where they saw the creatures.\"  The said the Big Foot Association in Mt. Hood, Wash., has been notified and will come to the site for a thorough investigation within the next few weeks. Meanwhile, it's feared that many curiosity seeksers will be going into the area in search of \"Big Foot.\" ",
