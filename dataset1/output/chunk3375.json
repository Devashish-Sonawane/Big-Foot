It has a long history of sasquatch activity.  The witness included several encounters in his report and was only able to add a few more details, since they occurred years ago.  His great uncle was respectful of wildlife, so it was very unusual for him to carry a rifle to investigate something in the area.  When the witness and his uncle saw the trees shake, he remembers his uncle repeating, \u0093Get in the truck!  Get in the truck!\u0094  Looking back, he wishes he had stayed longer when he saw something, but recalls feeling it was a  \u0093Let\u0092s get out of here!\u0094 situation.",
