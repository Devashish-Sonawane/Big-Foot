            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness and his Dad by phone. Both seemed sincere and honest in their retelling of the events that afternoon. The home is located in a new subdivision on the very edge of a heavily wooded area east of Atlanta. The family moved here just 5 months ago from Illinois. The witness is15 years old, and was making himself some dinner in the kitchen. He was standing in front of the window that overlooks the forest. It was appx. 5:30 pm and near dusk, but still plenty of light, enough to see into the forest as there were no leaves. He noticed something crouched down behind a tree about 200 feet from the house. He could see a hairy arm, and foot sticking out from behind a large tree. He immediately realized it was very large, crouched down to avoid being seen, and didn't match anything that should be in the woods. He described it as black in color and definitely too big to be a man. The witness immediately ran to the next room to alert his father. When the father arrived at the window, it was already gone. Tracks and/or impressions were looked for but not found. ",

It sounded like a long blowing horn, so I turned my TV on mute thinking it was a siren. I knew it was not a siren when I heard it again, and I knew it was coming from something alive. I went outside and the noise was so disturbing that I actually felt scared of it. It was more like this cry but in a howl, like it was hurt and moaned in pain by an injury. I have a few dogs, and each of them were very disturbed by it too. They refused to come near the front or back doors. It was like they didn't want to come outside. I assumed it must be a bear or a mountain lion, but the one thing that confused me was I don't think animals like them sound like that.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Regarding the sound event at 1 a.m. on October 25th,     - It went on for close to an hour and a half.      - The howling sound was like an animal hurt or in pain; very plaintive and mournful.     - The witness lives with his grandmother who also heard the sound and she did not know what it was either.     - He overheard people talking about the loud, unusual sound heard at night while in town the next day.With regards to the sighting along Highway 88 that evening at 8:00 p.m., there is more detail to add. Upon discussing the incident with the witness, it is clear they both had a good view of the subject along the side of the highway. His initial written report was not as detailed as his recounting of the event. He and his friend both are certain they saw a large, hair-covered, bipedal creature on October 25th along highway 88 in the San Joaquin Valley of northern California. After our discussion, I have the following details to add:     - The driver of the vehicle (his friend) exclaimed, \u0093There\u0092s going to be an accident!\u0094 as the car in front of them braked and swerved to the left.  Then his friend shouted, \u0093What the (heck) is that?!\u0094 They were forced to brake and slow to approx 5 mph when they sighted the creature ahead of them and approx. 40 feet from the right shoulder of the road.       -The duration of his sighting was between 20 and 30 seconds.     -The subject was illuminated in the periphery of the headlights of 3 vehicles.     - The creature turned and stared at the lead vehicle. This afforded the witness a good look at its features.  \u0093It did not look back at us, but at the car in front of us.\u0094     - What stood out most was the large, glowing eyes. He described them as white, with a reddish aspect \u0096 \u0093very much like an animal\u0092s eyes when a light is shined on them.\u0094     - The arms were noticeably very long, hanging well below the waist.     - The shoulders were broad and the height was estimated to be close to 7 feet tall or more. He stated it was like looking at NBA basketball player Yao Ming.     - As he states, the hair was dark brown and black. It seemed to cover the face as well. He did not notice any bare skin on the face, but as he mentions, he did not get a clear view of the facial details. The eyes seemed to hold his attention.     - He believed the creature was crossing the road and was nearly hit by the lead vehicle.  When asked what it did after turning around to look at the lead vehicle, the witness stated, \u0093It walked off into the field. It was trying to get out of the way.\u0094Both the witness and his friend were very much impacted by what they saw. Their initial reaction was one of fright and disbelief. We discussed the possibility of the subject being a person in a costume, but the height, the arm length and the natural, fluid walking motion rule this out according to the witness.  They returned home later that evening by a different route and are still wary of returning to the location. The subject did not threaten them or intimidate them, but the intensity of the experience has left both the witness and his friend shaken. This was his first and only encounter with a sasquatch and no friend or relatives have ever discussed the subject.NOTE: Visited the sighting location on Saturday, Oct.30.I did a survey along both sides of Hwy 88. No footprints or obvious spoor was discovered. The location is a few miles into Amador County from San Joaquin County, approx. 1 mile north of the Hwy 88 and Jackson Valley Road junction.",
