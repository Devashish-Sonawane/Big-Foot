            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the submitter of the report, who found tracks on the property, and also her brother-in-law, who had the close encounter. I found the statements of both witnesses to be very compelling. The submitter of the report lives out of state now, but grew up at the location of the incidents. She returns to the area for visitation with relatives. She told of several occurrences that the family believed related to bigfoot. She found large, barefoot tracks out by the pond. A bigfoot researcher took casts of the tracks and told her that he thought a juvenile sasquatch was responsible for making them. The family has smelled peculiar and strong odors from time to time; they've heard loud, deep, ominous growls from within the woods and they've heard loud, heavy-sounding footsteps on the gravel driveway at night.The submitter's brother-in-law would occasionally find the gate of the chain-linked fence lifted up off its hinges and placed to the side. The family was at a loss as to what or who exactly was going to the trouble of lifting the gate up off the hinges merely to place the gate just beside the gateway.The brother-in-law had an extraordinary encounter in January 2003 while gathering and breaking kindling. I spoke directly with him about the incident. He told me that he knew in an instant what he was seeing, as the encounter was at a distance of no more than fifteen feet; the chain-linked fence was all that separated the two. The witness told me that his nerves were shaken to the core, and that he was \"all choked up.\" He said he looked at it for a few seconds before hurriedly turning and fleeing to the house. He recalled the animal doing the same thing; as the witness turned, the animal turned and escaped off into the thicker woods. The witness could not recall facial details per se, but he did say that to the best of his recollection, it had a \"unique face\" and the animal was covered in red-brownish hair with gray interspersed. He estimated that its height was no less than seven feet. The creature initiated no aggressive behavior or sounds. Upon entering the house, the witness tried to explain to his wife what he had just witnessed, but had much difficulty talking. Finally he was able to enunciate \"bigfoot - I saw a bigfoot.\"About three months later, he heard a loud, deep growl from the woods which badly scared him and a nearby dog.The witness said he doesn't speak of these events with neighbors for fear of ridicule. The family keeps it all within, although it may be a safe assumption that they are not the only ones in the area who may be encountering these animals.     ",

            "Observed": "It was dusk my friend, his girlfriend and I were relaxing and swimming at a launch ramp off of Vinton Gulch Road near Oroville CA. When we got there we heard faint sounds like there were two, what we thought at the time, mountain lions calling each other off in the distant. My friend fished while I explored and his girlfriend swam. When all the other anglers that we fishing too me and my friend started making very loud sounds just to hear the echos off the surrounding canyons of Lake Oroville. Then I remembered hearing on one of the sound recordings off of this website and how there was sort of a whistle at the end of the recording from bigfoot so I started trying to imitate the whistle. Well after about five minutes I heard something \"running\" through the treeline of thick bushes above the lake line. It was coming towards us. I asked if anyone heard that and the said no. Right after I said that we heard the same sound earlier but within I'd say 200 ft from us at the bush line. We jumped in the car and turned around so we could make an escape in case anything attacked. My friend shined his light along the treeline and seen some eyes low at the tree line. So I stared whistling like I did before and it would make its sound softly. Well after three times I started mocking it and to our surprise and what made us leave was it whistled back to us. We took off. I tried finding sounds of mountain lions off of the internet that sounded the same but to no avail. Then I listened to monkey and bigfoot sounds and the only thing that came close was a Black Howler monkey. It had almost the same cooing sound. I don't know if it was a mountain lion that could whistle but I believe bigfoot is around and I will continue hunting on around Oroville CA for signs or answers.",
