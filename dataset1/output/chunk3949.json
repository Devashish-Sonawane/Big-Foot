This wasn't unusual as we have a lot of deer near our house.  The noise kept getting closer and closer,  at this point I figured that it wasn't a deer because it was coming so close to the out house.  I hastly pulled my pants up and opened the door.  I saw bigfoot.  He was very much like other people had described him tall, hairy, and buff.  He looked like an over-sized monkey.  As soon as he saw me he took off into the woods.  Later that night my whole family heard screams, we assumed it was bigfoot eating a deer but we weren't sure.",

This report is interesting because the sighting occurred before much of the Bigfoot hype, he does not care to talk about the sighting. After apparently startling the creature when he was 13 years-old by exiting the outhouse, which was only between 50-75 yards away from the home in a field, it \"lumbered away\" toward the woods.  It appeared to be a \"dark brown, almost like chocolate, but just a little bit darker.\"  The entire body was covered in hair and it initially made no sound save for the rustling of leaves as it approached.  Later that night the entire family heard howls that may have been made by multiple creatures and the witness stated that they sounded similar to the 1978 Whoop-Howl from Snohomish County, Washington, \"...only much closer.\" Click here for the Snohomish Recording",

I know that this may sound like it's made up but so help me GOD it's the truth. People always laugh when I used to tell them about it, so you just don't tell thing like this to people.
