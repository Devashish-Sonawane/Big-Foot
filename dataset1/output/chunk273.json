Mostly, I was there in the afternoon, when the days were short, and early evening in the summer. (Summer is busy in the park.  It's rarely quiet there, in the evenings). During the cold months, in the afternoon, the park is very quiet and deer and coyotes are common sights there.  I never investigated the knocking sounds on other occasions and did not really give them much thought.",

Part of the park is open grassland, some is forested by pines and flowering trees, and part of it is swampy terrain, especially along the lake edges.  There are several large brambled areas.  There are intermittant stands of brush throughout the park, a community farm, a pet cemetery, large off-leash areas, sporting grounds (cricket, baseball, soccer, tennis),an auditorium, a velodrome, and a house/museum.  The old chicken coops and barns are now facilities/maintenance offices and sheds.  The park hosts a great deal of wildlife:  rabbits, weasels, water fowl, salmon, snakes, birds of prey (owls, osprey, hawks), coyotes and deer.",

She used to walk her dogs at Marymoor Park in the evenings in a secluded area near the Sammamish River. She has witnessed deer and coyote during the winter months. Wood knocking was heard several times during previous walks.  One evening she heard an animal like howl that she describes as quite loud and sustained. The howl was again made several yds away and included more wood knocks. The witness was alarmed but continued on her way.She has conversed with Park Staff on earlier occasions and once was told of a deer kill that the staff thought was unusual. I have been to Marymoor Park several times and over 200 species of animals are known to visit the park. I believe that the adjacent Sammamish River and surrounding terrain is consistent with known Bigfoot habitat preferences. I believe the witness heard vocalizations from a Bigfoot.",
