            "Observed.1  ": "  November 10, 2006   A mysterious sighting in Washington County has area residents wondering if a \"Bigfoot\" could be roaming the wooded areas near Holy Hill. The sighting has area officials and residents bewildered, bemused and amused. A man contracted by the Department of Natural Resources to pick up road kill came to the Washington County Sheriff\u0092s Department to report a 7-foot-tall \u0093animal\u0094 had taken a deer out of the back of his pickup truck at about 1 a.m. Thursday, Sheriff Brian Rahn said. According to the report, the man loaded a deer carcass into the back of his truck on Highway 167 near Station Way, got into the cab and prepared to drive away when a large black animal, very wide and larger than a bear, jumped into the back of his pickup and dragged out the carcass he had just loaded. \u0093He was horrified and took off out of there,\u0094 said Rahn. During his retreat, the man also lost an all-terrain-vehicle ramp that he used to ease carcasses into the truck. Deputies went to the location near Holy Hill after the man reported the incident \u0096 at about 4 a.m. Thursday \u0096 and could find nothing, including the ATV ramp, Rahn said. \u0093I don\u0092t believe we have Bigfoot running around Washington County,\" said Rahn. However, deputies will do an additional follow up on the report, he said. \u0093It will take more than this report to convince me,\u0094 Rahn said.  Dick Liethen lives on Troll Hill Road, just through the woods from the reported sighting. He was out hunting this morning, but didn\u0092t catch sight of anything unusual. \u0093If I\u0092m not hunting, I\u0092m out walking the woods and I\u0092ve never seen anything,\u0094 said Liethen. \u0093But the gentleman must have seen something. He was pretty shook up.\u0094 Liethen has a camera set up in the woods to record passing wildlife, but said he has not recorded any images of an animal matching the description. The sighting has added to Liethen\u0092s daily chores, however. \u0093Since this happened I will be taking out the garbage and getting the mail. My wife says, \u0091you do it,\u0092 but the paper might wait until it\u0092s light out,\u0094 said Liethen. Highway Commissioner Ken Pesch was amused by the report. \u0093That\u0092s one way to get rid of them,\u0094 said Pesch of the pilfered carcass. Reports of dead animals are sent to the Sheriff\u0092s Department and the state Department of Natural Resources contracts with the man to have the carcasses removed, Pesch said. \u0093We can\u0092t touch those carcasses. You need a license, so if they catch  Bigfoot, they might want to check his license,\u0094 said Pesch.",
