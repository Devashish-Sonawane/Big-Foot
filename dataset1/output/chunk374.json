The noises were coming from the direction of Highway 101.  Looking at a topo map there are several lakes north of SR102, west of Hwy 101.  I believe almost all the land is Simpson timber land with clear cuts/trees of several different heights.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to JS  Sunday 7-15-01 about her job discription, the possibility of mistaken Identity (just hearing other animals) and about the location. JS is an Environmental Engineer who's job is to measures ambient noise levels as part of an environmental impact statement. She works during the early morning hours when noise levels are at their lowest level, 2:00 to 4:00 AM. We spoke about other animal noises and her familiarity with them as possibile canidates for what she heard. Though this investigator may have over looked an animal indiginous to this area we were able to eliminate the likely candidates. She was very concerned that someone might bother the people of the residence where she took her recordings. She felt these animals were comunicating with each other to the north of her position and that there may have been one close enough to disturb the domestic animals  near her position. She said that there were at least 3 separate individual animals calling and responding to each other.This area has a long history of reported sasquatch activity.",

We were a quarter mile from the road, it was 1 am and we were standing on a large log, all three of us a few feet apart, casting. The river is approx. 100 feet across, the other side very steep, devils club, etc, going up into wilderness of the O.N.P. (Olympic National Park). The river erupted ten feet in front of us, a thunderous crack and then a soaking, knocking over one of our three lanterns. We each though one of us did it, then two more close together, \"crack-crack\", wall of water, soaking us. Then in the dim lantern light comes two watermelon sized rocks (how far could you throw one??) from the other side, two more thunderous splashes. My friend Mark said \"Look across the river!! What the @@#$ is that!! With just enough light we could see two huge figures standing on the ledge rock on the other side, swaying back and forth, eyes glowing turquoise green in the lantern light. The river was high and uncross-able from rainfall.",
