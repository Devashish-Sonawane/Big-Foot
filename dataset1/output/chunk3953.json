            "Observed": "My late Aunt once told me a story that may be of interest to you. In the late 60's she and her sisters were summer camp horse instructors for camp Bellowood of Union, Michigan in Cass County. My aunt was riding late one evening and notice that the horse seem to be really spooked about something. She was having difficulty controlling the animal so she just let it run on its own. While the horse was running she looked to her side and observed a large white colored figure that was keeping place with the horse for a short time. The figure was close to her height on a mounted horse. She was understandable spooked herself for some hours afterward.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the nephew of the witness by phone, and there aren't too many details to add to the report.  He was able to tell me what his aunt told him and other family members about her encounter.  While working at Camp Bellowood she decided to take an evening horse ride down a trail that was forested on both sides.  Her horse got spooked by something, so she let it have its reins and run on its own; it didn't want to stop running.  This is when she noticed 'something' paralelling her in the trees.  It was close enough that she could tell it was about as tall as her on her horse and white-colored, but she couldn't make out specific details because of the trees.  It kept pace with her running horse for a short time.  The incident scared her badly and she didn't talk about it much.Camp Bellowood is near the Three Rivers State Game Area and the St. Joseph River.",
