            "Observed": "My wife and I have a cabin just off the Wind River Hwy on Leete Road for weekend and vacation use. Saturday evening we arrived about 8:00 p.m. and after unpacking the car we walked out to road out front of the cabin, and noticed a very heavy musky skunk like odor. Our brown lab \"Sadie\" caught the scent too and started to look around for it, but it seemed to disappear quickly.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and his wife were at their cabin for a few days.  After arriving on Friday evening they smelled a very powerful scent near their cabin.  The wife was the first to notice it.  The witness described it as a cross between skunk and body odor, and very musky.  They said that it was over-powering and acrid.  The smell came from the direction that he later heard the vocalizations emanate from.An hour later, while he was outside and his wife was inside, he heard the vocalizations. He described it to me as a \u0093whooo-ooop\u0094 that repeated three times.  The sounds came from the back of their property about 300 yards to the east.  He could not recognize it as any animal that he knew.  He called his wife and they listened for about an hour, but it did not repeat.From looking over the area using Google Earth, the witness\u0092 cabin is right in the middle of prime sasquatch habitat. There is a river to the west a short distance, and also a good sized pond.  These would be excellent foraging locations.  There are forests surrounding the cabin.  The tracts of forest land are of varying ages from clear-cut to mature timber. I would actually expect to find sasquatches living in that area.  I also believe that in the summer time it would be a great region to conduct an expedition.  There are many other reports from that part of Washington State.  While it is not possible to state for sure that what they heard was a sasquatch, the combination of the smell, and the vocalizations would indicate a high probability.",
