            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this very credible witness and have these details to add from both witnesses:  \u0095 The vocalizations started after midnight and lasted several minutes. They were unlike anything both had ever heard before. The \u0093Whoop-howls\u0094, one right after the other, reminding them of monkey or chimp calls. The animal repeated the same tone and pattern about 5 or 6 times and it grew higher in pitch toward the end of the vocalization. His friend reported that it sounded as if the animal was trying to imitate another animal because the last repetition was flawed, as if its voice had cracked. The vocalization sounded like it originated from the other side of the island.\u0095 His friend had mounted flashlights to the rigging on the front deck of his 13ft kayak so he could see the shore as he approached; he was the first to approach the beach. At 100 feet from shore he noticed the reflection of green eyes wandering around their campsite that strangely watched him the entire time he was approaching but disappeared into the forest by the time he beached his kayak. At the time he didn\u0092t mention this to his companion.\u0095 At approximately 2:30 to 3:00 AM they approached the beach for a second time, (After fishing). They were close enough to see their campfire, when a large rock was thrown that landed within ten feet of his friend. They immediately backpedaled the kayaks at least ten feet and were shining their LED lights so that most of the shore was illuminated except a few feet past the shore where the willow trees began. Their flashlights did catch the second, \u0093Bowling ball\u0094 sized rock thrown at them in the same vicinity as the first rock. \u0095 The area where this event occurred is typically a peninsula but can be underwater and inaccessible to four wheelers from May through July. \u0095 Keystone Lake is a 26,000-acre recreational area located in north-central Oklahoma. It is located on the Arkansas River just below the confluence of the Cimarron River. It has a diverse 330-mile shoreline and a public hunting area covering approximately 15,500 acres with sandstone bluffs, sandy beaches, steep hills of post oak, blackjack, hickory, cedar and bottomland timber. Sandstone hills are covered with scrub oak, grassland, prairie fields and plum thickets. Principal wildlife includes white-tailed deer, rabbit, quail, dove, squirrel and waterfowl.     ",
