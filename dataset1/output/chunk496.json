            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness is a 27 year old male. He is a gas company employee, firefighter and reserve police officer. Sighting took place down a narrow, one car backroad. The two witnesses observed the creature from a distance of about 40 yards. It was very dark but they saw clearly with their headlights. When their headlights hit the bipedal creature, it dropped the rabbit and quickly jumped into the woods in one leap. The woods went right up to the road, there was very little shoulder. Although they did not get a look at its features, the hair color was dark brown and the behavior was definately not that of a bear. They immediately went back to look for tracks and see what it dropped. They could not find any tracks in the hard packed ground. When they found the rabbit, the hair stood up on their arms and they decided that it was time to go. The rabbit did not look like it had been pulled apart, it looked as if it had been neatly cut in half just behind the front legs. During the interview, the witness shared that there was a smell that reminded him of a sweaty, football locker room. The 7' height estimate was determined by the branches that it hit as it jumped into the woods. They had their windows rolled up, with the radio on when the sighting took place, so nothing was heard. The incident took place near the Tombigbee River, in a habitat of pine and oak woods. There are also many creeks nearby.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness who is a 20 year veteran public service officer. He stated that the thing that was the most disconcerting was how strong the scream was and the accompanying \"ape\" sounding grunts. He felt that there were two animals in the woods behind his house. When he yelled back, the animals sounded like they began to move closer. As he felt threatened, he quickly moved into his house. He has not seen or heard anything similar since.This area is within the same subdivision as report #14887 and occurred during the same time period.----[Editor's Note - Matt Pruitt]There were several incidents in this section of Paulding County during the time that this particular witness experienced the aggressive behavior. The sasquatch that was observed and encountered multiple times during this period was particularly confrontational to the humans it encountered, and its intimidation strategy seemed to help it move through the populated area. The rash of sightings and encounters during this brief period (some of which are published on this website), and the credibility of these witnesses (retired military, police officers, etc.) strongly supports the hypothesis that one or more sasquatches were passing through the area during that time.
