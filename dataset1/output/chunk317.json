            "Observed": "I'm going to put down three different incidents that has happened since I move to the mountains of northeast washington. The first I have already reported. It happened back in march of '05. It was about 1 or 1:30 in the morning and it was pretty warm in my room, so I got up to open the window. As I was standing there let the cool air hit my face I heard a cry that was kind of what I would have to say a moan/growl. It was coming from the hill that is in front of the house I live at. I have lived up here since '96 so I get to hear the sounds of nature and I can say for sure this wasn't anything I've ever heard before. I didn't even think it could be a bigfoot until the next week when I told my dad. He told me son I think you heard a bigfoot. I wasen't ready for that, then he tried to tell me what it would sound like from what other people reported and that was what I heard that night.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met the witness in person and found him to be a polite, soft-spoken man in his mid-thirties.  He says he never thought much about the bigfoot mystery until after he heard his first howl in 2005.The witness has heard vocalizations on two separate occasions.  The first was in March of 2005 and the second was in August of 2008.  He says both sounded similar and described them as something \u0093between a scream and a growl\u0094.  The 2005 incident lasted less than a minute.  He was able to listen to the 2008 vocalizations for about five minutes.  He has since listened to the recordings on the BFRO website and says the 1973 Whoop-Howl from Puyallup, Washington recording was so similar to what he had experienced that \u0093It sent chills up my spine\".In February 2008 the witness was hiking along dirt roads near his home when he found a set of tracks in about three or four inches of snow.  He had no way of accurately measuring the track.  By placing his size 13 boot in one of the tracks he determined it was about four or five inches longer and about two inches wider than his boot.  (After seeing the witness\u0092s shoes, I would estimate the tracks he saw to be about 17 inches long and 7 inches wide.) The prints showed five toes, which were slightly splayed apart.  As with human footprints, the first toe was obviously larger than the others.  The tracks came from a grove of pine trees, crossed a dirt road and continued on the other side of the road.  He did not try to follow the tracks for any distance.  The witness is almost six feet tall.  He says when he tried to match the track strides he discovered them to be a foot or more longer than his own strides.The area around the witness\u0092 home is hilly, forested land.  There are creeks and streams nearby.  The area supports a large population of deer, wild turkeys and some elk.",
