            "Follow-Up Report": "I initially visited with the witness (whom I will call George) and his son (whom I will call Phil) over the phone.  We agreed to meet at the location as I am pretty familiar with the area.  We met about a week after the initial footprint find.  George had found what appeared to be an adult and a second set of tracks that appeared to be a juvenile.  My 15 year-old daughter, who has attended a BFRO expedition in the past, was with us.  When we first started to look around, I did 3 loud knocks to arouse the curiosity of anything that might be nearby.  We all examined the initial foot print area.  It is on the edge of a gravel road, and the prints were heading down a hill toward a large soybean field.  Since the prints were a week old, they had deteriorated and had lost details.  But they were the general shape and size of a Sasquatch.  We began to look around the area to try to determine the most logical approach directions.  My daughter, Phil and I found several animal trails leading toward open farm land and then toward timber and a large creek.  We also found several nice areas for shelter against a cold north wind.  These areas would also provide a great place for a Sasquatch to watch human activity in the area without being too exposed.  There were obvious areas where something had very recently bedded down.  This could have been deer, but the bedding area was quite large.  The area was full of tracks of many different animals including raccoon and several deer including one very large buck.We continued looking for tracks at the edge of the soybean field and proceeded to enter some timber.  We saw a couple of interesting looking stick structures.  Nothing was definitive, but they were interesting.  About this time, I did a couple of whoops and my daughter did a scream, and we did another softer knock.  We kept finding many areas where animals could easily travel very quickly without being seen.  We came upon a barbed wire fence.  A part of the fence had some smaller logs resting on it and my daughter, being the most nimble of our group, walked over them and continued to look around.  After a few minutes she said, \u0093Dad, did you hear that?\u0094  Phil and I agreed that we heard something.  I whistled a couple of times.  The woods had been quite silent up to that point and then we began to hear what we thought was a bird giving several short whistles.  My daughter then said, \u0093Dad, do you hear movement?\u0094  I agreed that I was hearing movement on her side of the fence.  Then she quickly squatted into a catcher\u0092s stance and said, \u0093Dad, my 12 o\u0092clock!\u0094  Both Phil and I looked but we had a poor angle.  We asked what she was seeing.  \u0093It is really big, and it is hiding behind a tree looking at me.\u0094  She went on to describe it as taller than me and I am well over 6 foot.  It was all dark brown and was peeking around a tree looking at her.  After probably 30 seconds of this, she looked at us.  When she looked back toward the creature it was gone.   We could hear some movement, but Phil and I never saw it.  As we were coming back up the hill to where the foot prints were originally found, George, for a brief moment, saw what he thought was an adult and a juvenile moving through an opening in the timber heading away from the area that my daughter saw the peeker.  He described them as very big and all dark in coloration.  ",
