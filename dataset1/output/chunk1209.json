A couple of friends who worked with me decided we should do a \"Bigfoot Hunt\", aka, a weekend camping trip.",

Right after that, a homeowner near that sighting found large footprints around his house and an outbuilding. It was in the local papers, but I don't know if it ever got reported for investigative purposes.",

The table was about 10 feet away, to their rear left and the rock throwing went on for 15 to 30 minutes, with long pauses in between each hit.Everyone who heard the voice the next morning was shocked by it. The witness describes the voice as unforgettable, and that he's yet to hear something similar to it. The timber of the voice was definitely masculine, but not too deep, sounding a little lower than a mid-pitched voice.After the camping trip, the witness went online to search for examples of possible sasquatch vocals. He found, and I sent him, examples of samurai chatter that he said sounded very similar to what he heard. Listening to the clips gave him chills.This part of Giles County is very thinly populated and most homes are seasonal cottages that remain empty throughout much of the year. The area is a vast, thickly forested, mountainous region with ample room and all the resources necessary for a number of sasquatch to survive unnoticed by humans.",
