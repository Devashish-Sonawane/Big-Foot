The bluff does have at least one fairly large cave  within 1/2 mile of the sighting--several other caves in the area. On the other side of the highway is the Roubidoux Creek.  Just passed the sighting area, the Roubidoux Creek (a very large creek that is prone to flooding) meets the Gasconade River. On the other side of  the creek is mainly farmer's land--fields and such. About 1/4 - 1/2 mile beyond the creek is another very large bluff with several caves. On the other side of the bluff that is next to the highway is miles and miles of woods, bluffs, valleys, gravel roads, and caves. (Pulaski County is the third largest county for caves in the state of Missouri and this happens to be an area that has a vast number of caves and caverns).",

(Pulaski County) almost exactly even with the \"40 MPH Speed Limit Sign\" When we got on up to the junction of Hwy 17 and Bus. 44, there was a residential structure fire and the Waynesville Fire Dept. was there. They had their water hoses ran across the intersection and had a metal ramp laid across the hoses, so that cars could drive over them. It was a very cold night and the water was running across the roadway and freezing. This made the intersection extremely slick. So, this information should be fairly easy to obtain.
