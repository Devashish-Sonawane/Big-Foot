Within about a year of the sighting, in the middle of the night the dog went crazy barking, scratching to get out.  We let her out.  She ran into the woods in the direction of our neighbor's pond barking all the way.  All of a sudden there was a yelp and then nothing.  The next day we combed the woods but all we found was a little piece of meat that looked like liver.  We always thought it was coyotes.  The whole area was abundant with rabbits, so we thought it odd they would take a dog.",

I got up and quickly opened the window.  I was ready to call the police.  The screams seemed to be coming from down the neighbors drive getting closer and closer.  Then, from the back wooded edge of our property (which borders the neighbor's drive), I heard what I thought was a loud owl, but kind of like a peacock.  The scream was in the middle of two other sounds (howls?)  There were about 3 scream-sequences and 3 owl-peacock calls.  Once I opened the window it quit.  I listened for about ten minutes with the window open but I didn't hear anything else.",

            "Observed": "My niece was living with us at the time of the sighting.  She was a senior in high school.  Our house is about 6 miles out of town and in 1987 when the incident occurred, it was very rural, though now it has become quite developed.  The school buses didn't go down the side roads so kids would have to walk to the closest main road.  We live not too far off the bus route.  The neighbor girl drove to school and she would often stop and give my niece a ride as she was walking to the bus stop.  On this particular morning she had just gotten in the neighbor's car when about 50 yards ahead, this creature came out of the swamp area on the right side of the road, paused in a crouching position, started crossing, then dashed very quickly across the road and into the woods.  She said she turned to the neighbor girl and said, \"What the hell was that?\"  To which the girl answered \"I don't know!\"  She says it was about the size of a bear, brown in color, but was definitely not a bear.  It started crossing the road walking like a gorilla (she even wondered if it could have been an orangutan or some kind of ape), then it ran the rest of the way very fast on all fours.  The whole incident happened so fast that she was not able to see much of the hands or feet.  She described it to me as being like an ape, but also sloth-like.  I said unless there had been an escaped primate from a traveling circus, we just don't have them in Washington.  She said it had hair covering its entire body and she noticed hair hanging from its arms.  She also heard from the swamp a whoop-whoop-whoop sound.  Thinking back she realizes that she had heard that sound coming from the swamp before, but thought it was some kind of bird.  It ran into an area of hundreds of wooded acres which eventually dip into the valley beyond (we are up on a plateau).  There is a ravine in the middle of this area.  To the right, past the swamp and as the crow flies there is Woods Creek about a mile or more away.  The deer pass by this area headed toward water at Woods Creek.  My niece said that she and the neighbor girl didn't say a word all the way to school and when they arrived she said again \"What WAS that?\" They both were dumbfounded.  She said it gave her the creeps and she felt scared.  We have talked about it on and off for years trying to think what it could have been.  A couple of weeks ago we sat down and I made a sketch while she guided me.  Actually she had to modify and finish it because I just could not figure out what she meant about how the head, chest and face looked.  When I saw her alterations I thought no wonder she was scared.",

First we had to find some so off we went to an area where we had never gone sense we moved to the area in 1979. When we arrived in the area in question it was around 330pm it was an average late november day in kentucky. Conditions were over cast, cold (40-50),and dry. As we made our way into and through the woods we found a logging road. the road was around 300 yrds in the woods and a dividing line between the two tree types. Once on the logging road we turned to the east and started up the road. After about 40-50 yrds or so we noticed several cows running about in the woods and a bull standing in the road just ahead. the bull kept looking to his right, our left at a large tree that was about 20 ft off the road. There were some smaller trees and cedar trees also from the road to the much larger tree that was about 4ft wide at the base. When we were in line with the tree we looked where the bull was still looking when we saw what was very clearly a very large bipedal creature with light brown hair from head to toe. I couldnt make out any facial features and the creature made no sounds even when I shouted bigfoot and the 4 of us ran directly to the south out of the woods which was around 300 yrds. We never went back there again and I have only told 1 other person about my encounter. I can honestly say that even with the training I had in the millitary and with law enforcement I would not go back there even if i were armed!",
