He lives in Texas but he visits Honobia periodically because his friend owns cabins in the area.He was heading toward Honobia from Noshoba was he had a glimpse lasting a few seconds of an upright figure the color of an \u0093Irish setter\u0094 crossing Highway 144 quickly at 10:10am yesterday morning. It was going from south to north across the highway. He was at a distance and could not estimate the height but was certain it was on two legs and moving quickly. There were no other vehicles on that portion of 144 at the time.He returned shortly after the incident to look for tracks but there is not enough bare soft ground on the shoulder of the highway to create any foot impressions.",
