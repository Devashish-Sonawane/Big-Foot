            "Observed": "I was on the way home from Franklin West Virginia, just come down Rt. 33 into Rawley Springs Virginia. About 200 ft. in front of me was an animal which I though was a black bear but this thing was as least 7 ft. tall and running on two legs. It stopped at the edge of the woods for maybe a couple seconds and twisted from the waist so that I seen its backside. Which was a very hairy and long armed animal. It had walked off into the woods. When I got to where it had stood I stopped and looked through the woods and I seen nothing, it was gone.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After conversing with the witness, the following details can be added to her account:She was returning to the Harrisonburg area from nearby Franklin West Virginia some time after 3:30 p.m. Along the long, flat stretch of road between the base of Shenandoah mountain and the village of Rawley Springs she spotted something black running on the road about 200 feet in front of her. At first she thought it was a bear, but quickly realized bears do not run up-right on their hind legs. And it was very tall, seven feet tall by her estimate.As the creature left the road and reached the nearby wood line it stopped momentarily and twisted from the waist. At this point the witness could see a long hairy arm, hanging from a tall hairy body. She believed she was observing its backside, and not its front.When she arrived at the point where the creature entered the forest, she slowed and looked for it, but it was gone. The witness says the image of it standing at the forest's edge remains very clear in her mind, and found it incredible that the creature could disappear so quickly.This area of the George Washington National Forest has had several incidents in the last few years. Including a sighting by another driver on the same road just a couple miles to the west, and described in Report number 34583.",
