The witness described them as more of a \u0093bellow\u0094 than a scream. The animal would vocalize, stop for a few moments, and then vocalize again. This lasted for more than one hour.\u0095 Except for the vocalizations, it was very quiet.\u0095 The witness described the weather as \u0093cold as hell,\u0094 and estimates that it was between 15 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit.\u0095 The witness saw no other hunters during his stay in the area.\u0095 Being an experienced hunter, the witness is very familiar with wildlife sounds. He does not know what could have made these sounds, so he reported them to the BFRO.",

Other prints were visible, but not as good as this one.",

Depth was 3.5 inches deep.--The track line ran from along the dock toward the water, in a complete straight line.--The witness emphasized the depth of the track.
