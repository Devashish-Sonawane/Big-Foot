            "Observed": "My experience happened late June to early July of 2012.  Rural Christian County.  Between 8:00 and 9:00 pm.  I was relaxing by the fire texting and listening to my ipod. Watching a few cars pass the house.  To my left was the farmhouse, to my right was the driveway and a few out buildings plus tall weeds (about 4 feet tall) in an old pasture. Several feet behind me was the pole light and machine shed. I felt an eerie sensation to my right.  I looked in that direction.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I could have sworn I saw an outline of a head and shoulders above the weeds.  I continued to look in that direction and shrugged it off as my imagination.  I went back to texting.  Glancing to the same spot occasionally. I kept hearing a slight noise to my right. And I would look up. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a rolling limestone rock.  I didn't think about it at first.  Then I realized that rocks don't move by themselves.  I was freaked out and went inside. The next morning I went to investigate what could have formed the shape I saw.  Nothing was there.  I did find several sticks, corn stocks, and dirt clods in the driveway.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. In summary:\u0095 The animal was about 7 feet tall, standing head and shoulders above the weeds and foliage. The witness was approximately 25 yards from the animal.\u0095 The small limestone rocks were apparently from the driveway.\u0095 The rocks did not appear to be thrown at the witness but close enough to attract her attention.\u0095The witness stated that it was dark and she was able to see with the light from the pole light and camp fire.  \u0095Weather charts show that sunset is at 8:29 p.m. at this location so her sighting was closer to 9 p.m.\u0095This is an area of farms and several wooded creeks. The family does have horses. \u0095 On one other occasion the witness describes being followed while riding her horse by a large animal. Although she was unable to see the animal she could hear it walking, when she would stop, it would stop. The walking sounded like it was a biped. The witness became concerned and hurried back to her farm.  ",
