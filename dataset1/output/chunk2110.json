            "Observed": "Near Auburn Iowa. I was with three boys cruising the gravel roads, it was very late. It was summer around July corn was high. The two people in front were not paying attention as me and the other person saw cross the road a very big black hairy animal. It had a very arched back, it walked or strides were strange. The face was sort of dog like but it was hard to see it real good in detail because it was dark and a quick look. The legs I remember bent back. All I know is it was not anything normal or that anyone knows of, it was very scary looking .I was, and the person next to me in complete shock by what we had seen.",

As the witness and three other friends were out driving around on the county roads. It was getting late  between 10 pm and midnight when this animal appeared in the car headlights, taking only one to two steps to walk across in front of them to get from one side of the road to the other side. As the car speed was about 25-30 miles per hour the animal would have been about 20-30 feet in front of them when crossing. The height of animal was taller than their vehicle, even on all four legs, and bigger than a horse. The back legs looked inverted with big loin feet and had black hair.  Found the witness to be credible.",
