            "Observed": "About a year ago, I was coming home from taking my grandmother to work.  We lived on a paved but heavily wooded road. There are numerous ponds and fields surrounding the area.  As came across the final curve in the road, something caught my eye.  Just on the inside of the ditch by the pond before my house stood a figure.  At first glance I would have thought my eyes to be playing tricks. I slowed down and stopped fearing that I was going to hit a large animal.  I seen this tall figure (roughly 6 feet to 7 feet in height)turn and stare at my headlights.  It was Auburn-Brown and had very wirey hair.  Its head was kinda of oblong like that of monkey.  The face was flat other than the wierd looking nose (looked like a squished pig nose).  Its eyes glowed red in the headlights.  Once I stopped, it immediately turned and crouched into the ditch below.  I was so scared of being attacked that I drove the half mile home, ran inside and told my parents all about it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "According to the young man who was the witness in this report, he had been living in this area for about five years, and had never seen or heard anything like this animal before.  As I spoke to him by phone, he added a few details to the report that he filed, and spoke as someone who has seen something he can't explain.As he came to a stop a few feet from the animal, the witness said it looked right at him,  its eyes glowing red in the headlights.  He described it as narrower at the bottom, and wider at the top, and as being \"almost a little hunched\", as it stood there.  It had hair that appeared to be around four inches in length, but perhaps one and a half to two inches on it's head.  He could not recall seeing any hair on it's face.The animal did not have a snout, as a bear does, but had a flat nose, and a face with deep, inset wrinkles, which the witness described as being \"almost like a baboon\".  He also said that it had eyes that were a little bigger than a person's--about gumball sized. In the next few nights following his sighting on the road, the witness reported hearing vocalizations that sounded \"sort of like a coyote mixed with a gorilla\".   Also, while waiting outside for a friend to come one night, he heard something heavy running in a strip of woods in the cow pasture next door, snapping branches and causing the cows to move to another location.  When the sounds got closer and closer, he decided it was time to go indoors.The witness worked with artist Sybilla Irwin to create the sketch of what he saw .",
