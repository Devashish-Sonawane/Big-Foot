There is a large sand dune that makes you forget you\u0092re in southeast Ohio.  I grew up in this county, and have heard the stories about this particular area.  Friends of mine would sometimes attempt to camp out near Jackson Lake.  They would often tell stories of \u0093ghost\u0094 sounds and other strange happenings at night in this area.  Not until reading this report and speaking to this witness did the memories of this place return.  I have no reason to discredit the witness\u0092 report.  The sounds and behavior reported are hallmarks for sasquatch intimidation techniques.",

We were within a couple miles from home when she spotted what she said was a very broad creature that stood on two legs and I became really excited when she said what stuck out to her the most was the figures cone shaped head and the way the hair shined when the lights hit it. I am still angry with myself because I was asleep on the passenger seat. She says the creature had its back to the road and disappeared when we went past it. She franticly explained to me what she saw when we got home and being the Bigfoot enthusiast I am jumped in my car and returned to the spot but didn't see anything.",

The only person awake in the car was the wife who was obviously driving and I spoke with her and her husband. She used to be a skeptic before this night.  It was 10 to 15 feet away from the car when she first sighted it. It was on the same side of the road but moving away from her so its back was to her. She said it disappeared quickly as she approached it.  The husband continued to scout the area for over a week.The family has heard knocks and howls several times over the years. They know of other sightings in nearby counties. ",
