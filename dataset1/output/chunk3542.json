We call it baldy because there are no pines or aspens on the front side of it. All the pines sit on the north side of the mountain, but everywhere else is very dense brush and very tall.  The only way to walk through it is on a game trail and even then you still get all scraped up.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "When I talked to the witness by phone he emphasized how upset the dog was and said he\u0092s never seen him \u0093freak out\u0094 like that. He said the dog was bristled-up from his tail to the top of his head. He said that the dog will normally not hesitate to lunge a little toward a person - but in this case he backed up a bit.  In the written report he said the sighting lasted about a minute or two, but when I talked to him he clarified this and said he wasn\u0092t looking at the creature the whole time. He said he saw it for about ten to fifteen seconds, then stepped back into the house to put the dog in, and then looked back out to see if it was still there. When he saw that it was still there he started wondering if it was just a tree in the neighbor\u0092s yard he\u0092d forgotten about. He then saw it duck and turn, and the silhouette of its head disappeared from view. He saw it about ten seconds the second time. The witness told me that at the time he thought what he saw was a person, by default. He didn\u0092t think of it being a bigfoot until he did some reading on the BFRO website and started thinking about that possibility. He said it was just recently that he went and stood next fence and realized just how tall the creature would\u0092ve have been. He estimates it was between 6\u00928\u0094 and 6\u00929\u0094. I have no doubts that the witness is sincere and credible. Even though he saw only a silhouette of a large head on a tall animal,  there's a very good chance the tall animal was a bigfoot, due to the location. The report therefore deserves to be listed in this database as a public Class B report.",
