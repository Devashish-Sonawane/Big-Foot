IT SEEMED TO DECIDE THAT I WAS NO THREAT AND IT WALKED AWAY INTO THE DEEPER WOODS. I HAD A PISTOL WITH ME BUT DID NOT FEEL THREATNED ENOUGH TO ATTEMT TO KILL IT. I DONT BELIEVE THE .38 WOULD HAVE STOPPED IT ANYWAY. THEN IT WOULD HAVE PROBALY RIPPED ME LIMB FROM LIMB.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness maintains a corn pile for deer as he is a deer hunter. He was checking his deer pile and walked up on the creature with its back to him. His sighting lasted about a minute before the creature walked into thick brush effortlessly.  Witness is just under 6 feet and felt dwarfed by the creature which he believed to be a male. He described the creature as having reddish-brown hair (like a burlap sac), \"blunt teeth\" like a hog or human, big lips, and an ape-like face with a flat nose. He felt the animal was not as intelligent as a human but like a \"smart Labrador retriever\" as it did look him over before walking away.I asked if he had game cameras up, and he never has. He will be starting to hunt again next week and plans on having his camera with him just in case.Eastern North Carolina has a lot of wooded areas and has had numerous sightings over the years. The area has lots of wildlife: deer, bear, turkey, feral hogs, and smaller game. Witness stated you could travel through the area unseen for many miles, and he feels the creatures are rare and definitely do exist.",

Me, my sister and her friend found the keys to my brothers 4-wheeler and decided to sneak it out @ approx 10:30 pm on a snowy winter night. Nobody knew we were going to do this, so there is no way anyone could have been waiting for us in a costume or anything.  Plus nobody knew I even knew how to operate a 4 wheeler (including myself).   We headed out to the woods behind our parents house and half way down a steep hill the 4 wheeler took off flying and when I figured out what gear to put it in the 4 wheeler stopped and my sister and her friend jumped off.  I recall smelling something \"dead\" then I heard something that sounded like Monkeys (yes multiple) fighting.  When I looked towards the trees I see this huge monster walking out.  This thing was at least 7.5 or 8 ft tall and standing straight up with huge long arms and legs. As it was walking towards us it made a deep growling angry noise.  I took off on the 4- wheeler and my sister and her friend were running as fast as they could to catch up.  I looked back a few times and recall thinking- this thing is walking but one of it's steps was equal to 20 of mine.  We were in a panic we were all screaming and the louder our screams the deeper it's growl got. By the time my sisters friend had grabbed her arm and yanked her onto the 4 wheeler, it was within it's arms reach of us but never tried reaching out to hurt us. It was obvious he or she wanted us out of there.  I was only about 13 at the time so I wasn't wise enough to call someone to come research it.  I believe our parents just thought we were making it up.  And of course, I was way to scared to go back and track foot prints or anything.",
