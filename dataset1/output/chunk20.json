            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was credible, and this is definitely the type of topography and food sources that could support a large creature such as a Sasquatch. There have been numerous reports of activity in North Central Wisconsin.The witness also shared pictures of noteworthy tree structures and ground glyphs nearby. The footprint was less conclusive. It is unfortunate that the witness did not have casting material as photos do not always provide the needed detail.While a bear could have been responsible for the rustling, only a Sasquatch or a human have the opposable thumbs required to hurl rocks. There was only one other human in the camp. Unauthorized human visitors could also be suspect, but it is widely known that gun carry permits are the rule, not the exception, so a human hurling rocks wold likely know they would be endangering their life. It is noteworthy that the campers did not have interaction until they set up in the most remote part of the camp. It was easy approach for a Sasquatch out of the woods, perhaps feeling the campers were intruding too deeply upon his/her territory.",

As we were passing East at Long Creek I looked to the left and saw what looked like a pile of dark Spanish moss looking grass. I thought to myself that it was odd to see a large pile of soggy grass and moss that was oddly shaped so symmetrically. Then I saw that it was a creature standing  trying not to be seen and as still as can be. I couldn\u0092t speak, I couldn\u0092t process what I was seeing and then the words left my mouth... \u0093Honey\u0094 I said to my husband, \u0093I just saw a Sasquatch by the side of the road crouching down\u0094. He could tell by the look on my face that I had, in fact, seen something. I still can\u0092t believe it, I\u0092m chuckling nervously talking about it... unbelievable.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This couple were driving east on 73rd Avenue East having turned off Wauchula Road in Myakka City. 73rd Avenue East is a private dirt road. The sky was overcast; it had rained earlier in the morning.Three days earlier Subtropical Storm Alberto had just churned up the gulf coast of Florida and had left the Myakka River at flood stage overflowing into the wetlands and low-lying areas. The road the couple were traveling and surrounding area was flooded. See photo:See map: LatLong.net Just before where the road crosses Long Creek, the woman noticed a large shaggy human-like shape on the north side standing just behind the fence line. She lives nearby and travels the road daily and knew it wasn\u0092t something that had been there in the past. Shaken by the size and possibility of what it could be, she told her husband to turn around because she had just seen a sasquatch. Her husband said she displayed shock and alarm when she stated that. He promptly turned the car around. When they returned to the spot she had seen the figure it was no longer there. Although the road was flooded, this happened to be a higher and dry spot. They stopped the car and was able to find what they believe are two-foot prints about 50 feet from where the figure had been. In one photo, the woman had stepped on a print before realizing it. The prints seem to indicate the creature went west towards the Watershed along the road once the car passed and probably back into the tree line.  See photos:The flood waters have caused a nearby field of potatoes to rot. The rotting potatoes are all that could be smelled.The woman described the figure as dark ash brown in color. At first, she thought it was covered in moss, but realized it looked shaggy and matted because the 3-4-inch hair was wet. It was standing still facing the road with arms by its side on the other side of the fence. She could not see facial features but noticed the head was pointy, and the shoulders were very broad compared to its hips. It stood about 3 feet above the fence which was later measured to be 5 ft high. Standing still as if to look like a stump when humans are nearby has been reported many times.This unusual daylight sighting could be speculated on happening because of the strange events at the time. The atmospheric conditions from the tropical storm were very unstable as rain and wind continued in the area, the flood stage could have had the sasquatch trying to find dry ground. The private road has little traffic especially since only trucks could make it through the water so there was less chance of being seen. The rotting potatoes could be smelled from quite far.  The area surrounding this sighting is very welcoming to sasquatch. There are many farms growing potatoes, watermelons, citrus as well as raising livestock. The nearby creek offers fish and aquatic creatures for consumption.  Interestingly, there is a Lemur Breeding Reserve nearby that has planted mango, passion fruit, guava, grapes, banana, persimmon, and bamboo to feed their 50 lemurs. Although there are many acres of farm land, there is also plenty of tree cover for concealment.Sasquatch have been known to follow creeks, canals and rivers and this sighting was next to Long Creek.  Long Creek runs into the Upper Myakka River Watershed which eventually runs into Myakka State Park where there have been many sightings. ",
