It sounded like something heavy coming down the hillside toward our tents at a very high speed. My Mother thought it might be a large rock or bolder rolling down the hillside. Anyway, whatever it was came between the two tents and made a huge splash in the stream across the way. The next morning when we emerged from our tents, one of the 2 picnic tables had been over turned, and more huge footprints were scattered around the camping area.",

He felt the arms were really long, hung around the knees and swung in motion with each  step.It had a very long stride, and Matt mentioned to me that after the experience he felt really terrified  because he knew it could have easily caught him if it wanted to. Especially interesting to me was Matt's description of the animal turning back to look at him as it left heading for the tree line (about two quick strides away).  \"It's head turned around maybe twice, to look back, it couldn't have had much of a neck, very short, in fact it had to turn its whole upper body to look around.\"  He remembers a cone shape to its head and the hair was very dark and shined like greasy human hair does in light. To quote, Matt stated the following:  \"I was in shock, I suppose because  this thing I 'd passed off for a tree began walking like a man, with arms and legs swaying.\"  He also estimated the height of it between eight and ten feet tall.  He felt it looked similar to the Patterson film but thinner and not as broad.  His final comments, besides sharing some older stories, were : \"If you are in a big overgrowth area, it can just stand there, and you would never know it was there.\"",

My friend and I had run a trap line about a quarter mile or so and checked it daily after school. On one occasion after returning to our vehicle we heard movement at the top of the hill, roughly 80 yards or so. and a smell that to this day I've never smelled again. A rotten egg sulphur smell that was over powering. We left quickly and didn't run a trap line for quite awhile. Although this was quite awhile ago its the area that's key. This happened next to one of, if not the biggest national wildlife refuge areas, Horicon Marsh. If such a thing as Bigfoot exists, and I believe they do, you probably won't find a better place in the US because a lot of it is restricted, no hunting.Check it out it will not disappoint, the place is huge and scary.",
