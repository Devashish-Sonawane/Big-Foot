            "Follow-Up Report": "[Editor's note: MM]The hair on the heads of sasquatches is often described by witnesses as peaked or spiked. It is very possible that a sasquatch could appear to have pointy ears, due to the hair, especially if an observer had only a brief view in dark conditions through a rear view mirror.The mouth area of a sasquatch protrudes out a bit, like a muzzle, as depicted in the William Roe sketch. The more telling element of Steve's story is that the animal was standing outside the truck and \"reached\" into the back to grab the deer carcass. That's not a bear, or a \"bear-wolf\". That is something with thumbs. A bear or a \"bear-wolf\" would grab a deer carcass with its mouth, not an arm.Sightings occur periodically in North America, but they rarely become local news stories, much less national news stories. This one eventually became a national news story, albeit briefly. The difference in this case seemed to be: 1) the willingness of the witness to report the incident directly to the authorities (highway patrol) immediately after it occurred, and  2)  the willingness of the authorities to accept the story and take a statement.  Their willingness to take a statement from the witness put the report into the police blotter pipeline, where it caught the eye of the local news media. That path of transmission had meaning in itself. It subtly suggested that the report was a credible, though unexplained, observation by a reliable observer. This seemed to be the key element that made the report acceptable to the local media, and eventually to the national media.]",
