            "Follow-Up Report": "Following my interview with the witness, the following details can be added to this report:Regarding the sighting, the witness reports the creature\u0092s head was very large, with a flat face and wide nose.  He reported the eyes to shine red in the headlights, but also reported a brief glimpse of \u0093white reflection\u0094 as the head turned away.  His uncle acknowledged an animal crossing the road in front of them, but when asked what it was, replied something like \u0093Oh, it was nothing\u0094.  The witness reports his uncle didn\u0092t see the creature stand in the ditch and step over the fence on two feet, as it was on the witness\u0092 side of the truck as they passed.  He reports seeing the animal stand on two feet to cross the fence.  He says the fence was approx. 4ft high.  He reports the animal was out of the headlights when he stood erect, but was seen doing so in what little light was available to the witness at the time, but he lost sight of it after that.Regarding additional local stories the witness related to me:The witness reports a history of cattle and sheep disappearances from neighboring farms and ranches reported to him by \u0093old-timers\u0094, and he reports an unusually high population of coyotes (historically) in the area as well.  The witness reports the area is predominantly an agricultural area, with many large fruit and nut orchards in the area, as well as many acres of field crops nearby.The witness also reports hearing \u0093screams\u0092 while hunting in the same general area as a young man.  He reports the screams were \u0093several miles\u0094 away, and of a lower tonal quality than vocalization recordings he has heard on television and on the Internet.  These screams were also witnessed by some of his boyhood hunting partners at the same time.The witness also reports a strange occurrence while on a Boy Scout camp-out a couple of years after his roadway sighting.  He reports attending a camp-out with several other troops at a pond / lake near \u0093Black Butte\u0094, CA. The witness reports he was in his tent one night and heard another scout \u0093scream\u0094, and then heard a huge crashing through the underbrush and trees.  Soon afterward, a helicopter came to the campgrounds and evacuated the apparently hysterical scout from the area.  Reportedly, many sheriffs soon arrived, armed with shotguns and flashlights, and went into the woods searching for the \u0093wild hairy man\u0094 that the scout reportedly observed rummaging through his rucksack outside his tent.  This witness did not actually witness the \u0093hairy man\u0094 running into the woods, but heard it, as well as hearing the scout's scream quite clearly.  And the excitement that followed is something he says he stayed up to witness.  The \u0093hairy man\u0094 hunt was evidently fruitless, as the witness heard no reports of a successful capture.",
