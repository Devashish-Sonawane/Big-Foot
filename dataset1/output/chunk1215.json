I don't see what could attract it in this specific area, it is not densely populated, but there are plenty of homes. However it would also be easy enough to wander out of several areas where there is truly nothing but miles and miles of national forest connecting to nothing but more national forest.",

Upon opening the car door and stepping into the gravel driveway I heard a distinct and loud vocalization. It wasn't a howl, not a growl, nothing I had heard before which is what caught my attention. At 31 years old now, 28 then, I had spent my life in the outdoors, locally and abroad.",

The sound of bipedal walking could be heard in the dry leaves. The noises had his livestock (4-cows, 3-horses, and 2-goats) in such a frightened state that they had all come to a corner of the field near a gate where a dusk to dawn light provided illumination and security for them. They were all in the cone of light, looking toward the source of the noise. He estimated that the closest approach to his house was approximately 100 meters. The property is very near the national forest boundary. ",
