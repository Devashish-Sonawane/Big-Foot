            "Follow-Up Report": "I communicated with the witness on several occasions and he shared a few more details.  He stated the footfalls he heard were quite \u0093heavy\u0094, as if a large person was making long, semi-jumping steps, and were bi-pedal in nature.  He emphasized the strong smell he experienced during the encounter was not a skunk, but similarly powerful.  He also shared that he has extensive experience with animals, including primates, as a close relative had worked for a zoo for a number years and he assisted in taking care of many animals large and small.  He added he has lived in the area for approximately fourteen years, and began spending time at the encounter location in 1978.  The witness is very familiar with the local wildlife, how they move, sound, etc.The witness is a former fire fighter and chemical warfare specialist with the United States Navy.  He added that having seen many things during his life, he doesn't get shaken easily, but this encounter made him very nervous.      The location of this encounter is in Southeastern Guadalupe County, Texas.  This area is dense with thick brush and trees, and has a heavy concentration of wildlife, including deer and hogs.  The encounter location is also very close to the Guadalupe River.  This river flows through Guadalupe County into Eastern Texas and terminates at the Gulf of Mexico.  There are numerous small creeks and seasonal branches which crisscross the area as well.  ",
