            "Observed": "We are building a house near the Mackinaw River, so there is a lot of dirt pushed around. We have had lots of rain this year so that dirt turns to mud, I have been looking at the ground for arrow heads, and have seen several bare footprints ranging in size from a size 13 to three inches longer than my size 13's.  I have only been finding them since late September, and during cold spells as well.  Can't imagine anyone wandering around a construction site barefooted and in cold mud.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by telephone.- The witness found a total of three prints in the mud near his new home construction site.  Photos were taken but they were not clear enough to include with this report. - The witness did not measure the size of the footprints but thought that the length of the one set was about 14 inches long and 6 inches wide. This area has patches of woods and most of the streams are wooded as well. Sometimes it is difficult for people who drive through Illinois to accept that sasquatch inhabit Illinois.  My only answer is that Illinois has thousands of miles of wooded creeks and rivers. People tend to look at the fields of corn and soybeans. I look at the horizon, which is usually wooded because of the many streams.  We also have a very large white-tailed deer population.  According to the Prairie State Outdoors website, Woodford County had 1,950 deer harvested in 2009-2010, so there is plenty of deer and this location is certainly within an area of good habitat.BFRO Report #12836 is 30 miles to the west with footprints that I was able to observe when I visited the site. Twenty miles to the south are two media reports of Bigfoot flaps from the early 1970's:BFRO Media Article #430and BFRO Media Article #596 ",
