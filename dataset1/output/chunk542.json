On the morning of Tuesday, August 4th, around 8:00am, I was sitting in our \u0091sleeper compartment\u0092, on the port side of the train as it exited the long, Cascade Tunnel. I was just relaxing with my head back against the seat, looking out the window, letting the scenery pass by. The train was moving about 40mph and the landscape rose sharply up the mountain. (I was facing toward the rear of the train.)",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on August 11, 2009 for over an hour. I found him to be very relaxed, friendly, and matter-of-fact about his sighting. He had some additional details to add to his report: He noticed the figure on a steep hillside above the train. Its right hand was on a tree that was approximately 8 to 10 inches in diameter, in deep cover, with small, younger trees in front of and below it. At first he thought it was stationary; perhaps a cardboard cutout, when he noticed that its head was moving from side to side, as if it was watching the train go by. He saw the figure from head to toe. It was covered in black hair, and appeared to be \"very, very muscular.\" He estimated its weight to be 400 pounds. He did not notice any details of facial features. Its right elbow was bent, and its left arm was dangling at its side. The witness, who is a hunter, only observed it for about two seconds, but knew what it was immediately.  The area is remote and undeveloped, and very rugged, with lots of second-growth deciduous and coniferous trees, in addition to several creeks, at an elevation of 2000 feet.  I went to the area of the site one week after speaking to the witness and walked 1.5 miles of railroad track in an effort to pinpoint the exact location of the sighting. The tracks parallel US 2, and intersect with a power line right-of-way. The Deception Creek trailhead is also in the immediate area of the sighting.",

I have seen big foots on our property,  wood knocks so loud it scared me to death. Terrible smells like I can't explain and foot prints in fields.  Small monkey like creatures in trees.
