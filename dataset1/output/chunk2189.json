I have a extra bright headlight on my motorcycle and I approached an area with a saw mill, I notice something squating beside the road. I slowed and passed this thing and was no more than 4 feet away. I looked right into its eyes and face. The hair was about 2.5 to 3 inches long, black and shiny. I know it was not any animal I had ever seen before. No Bear No Dog nothing. The height if this thing had it stood up would be at least 6.5 feet tall. I continue to ask myself did I just see what I thought I saw. I was to shook up to stop and double check of what I saw. I still to this day wish I had stopped and verified what I saw. Anyhow I still look for it whenever I am night riding.",

He was convinced  the animal was trying to hide in the twelve-inch grass as he slowly passed on his motorcycle. The animal appeared young even though it was large.  He described the hair as coarse and slick as though it was covered in oil. It also looked as if the head sat right on the shoulders. Although he had seen movement from quite a distance,  the up-close observation only lasted about five seconds.  Enough time for him to realize this creature was unlike anything he had ever seen.  He summed it up by saying that the animal looked too much like a human.",
