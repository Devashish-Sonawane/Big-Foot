            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. He, the property owner, and his father were cooking a hog on a cooker around 11:30 am. The property is located among large pastures and fields for livestock. These fields include slight rolling hills and a few stands of oaks for livestock shade. The witness looks toward one of the fields, and at a distance of 300-400 yards, sees a very large dark figure apparently watching them cook this hog. The witness stated he asked the property owner \"what is that\"? The owner response was \"oh, that, I see him all the time\". The witness had his cell phone and took a photo, this is a screen shot of that photo:The witness was somewhat surprised that his friend quickly ended the conversation and seemed unwilling to further discuss the matter.. when the witness looked back, the figure was gone. At no time did the witness see the figure walk to or from the spot. It was there and 40 seconds later, it was gone. After the figure was gone, the witness and his father walked out to the spot it was standing and by using the height of tree branches, they estimated its standing height at 8 feet. Tracks were evident but not good enough to cast or photograph. ",

We where the ONLY ones in that camp site, so it was very quiet. We started to hear stange low noises almost like an old chainsaw trying to crank. Following that was a very high pitch humming noise. The sound was getting closer and closer. We took out our spot light and scanned the woods. What we saw was very disturbing....it appeared to be an up right figure, that was hairy and had a grey tent to its fure. It was standing behind a tree and was slightly hunching over, like it was hiding from us. We could see its back bowing out of the right side of the tree and its head coming out of the left. Theirs no doubt in my mind that it was an ape-like creature. It stood still for about 30 to 60 seconds. Then we decided to take the light off of it, to maybe see if it would move....about 10 seconds later we turned the light back on and it was gone! The next night we heard two seperate creatures but neither showed up.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Interviewed witness on 4-18-07. Sighting was made by a group of six campers that were led by a minister. They were all in agreement about what they saw. They all realized what they were looking at was not a bear or any other known animal. They said that it froze like a deer in the headlights. The group estimates that they were 20 - 30 yards away and their spotlight was very powerfull. It's eyes glowed yellow in the spotlight. It's height was estimated at 6' 8\" - 7' 8\". It had a dark gray face along with 3 - 4 inch gray hair of a fairly uniform length. It's head appeared to be slightly conical and wide. They only saw it's face from the nose up, as the tree was blocking the lower portion. It was also stated that it had a very muscular, human-like build. On earlier camping trips to this same location they have heard strange vocalizations and what sounded like something large walking through the brush on two legs.____________________________________Cheaha Mountain State Park in Talladega County, Alabama",
