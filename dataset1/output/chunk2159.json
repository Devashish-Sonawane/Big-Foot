            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness for approximately one hour. The details that he provided were consistent with the report that he submitted. Seven people heard the alleged vocalizations. The witness that I spoke with stated that a friend of his who was present that day played a vocalization off of a cryptozoological wesite of a purported sasquatch for him over the phone. He could not believe that his friend was able to duplicate that specific sound that they had both heard that night. It was only after the witness in question instantly recognized the incredible similarity between the sound played for him over the phone and the sound that they had all heard that night, that he was informed that what he had just heard over thephone was a recorded vocalization of a purported sasquatch. The area in question is located in Sussex county, New Jersey. While New Jersey has an extremely dense population, the north west corner of the state is largely made up of farmland and rural communties with the Kittatiny Mountains to the south of this particular location and the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania to the northwest. The Deleware River is within close proximity, and there are miles of preserved wilderness, including Stokes State Forest, and High Point State Forest, providing many miles of heavily forested areas that contain strong populations of deer, rabbit, coyote, black bear etc.. There have also been documented eyewitness-accounts of mountain lion sightings. The terrain/ecosystems that exist here have much in common with Pennsylvania. There is a history of sightings in this general area of the state, as documented by both eyewitness accounts and media articles under the \"Sussex County\" heading of the New Jersey section of the sightings database.
