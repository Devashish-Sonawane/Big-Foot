It was about 6 ft tall dark, burnt orange hair all over its body, it ran slowly across the road into woods. Was on two feet upright. I got a very good look at it and was very disturbing. Nothing i have ever seen before. I did not report at the time, didnt think people would believe me. Then on april 3, 2011, on my way back from Frankston Texas on hwy 155 just before Brookshire's grocery store on right going north we saw the same type of creature standing on the edge of the tree line of a large wooded area. same description. My son and i both saw it for 10 to 15 seconds. I pulled over on road got out and walked into woods and saw nothing. This is twice I'm sure we saw the unexplained.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Both witnesses were contacted on 10/03/2011 and the report was discussed at length (2 hours). During both sightings the father was driving the truck and the son was a passenger.The first sighting was a road crossing in August or September 2010, that occurred while they drove east, sometime just after noon. The animal passed from left to right in front of their truck at a distance of about 40 feet. It crossed the two-lane dirt road in three to four seconds and only required three steps. The father stated that the animal did not appear to be affected by seeing the truck. He further reported that the posture was upright and slightly leaning forward and it moved \"smooth and with purpose.\" He described that it had a \"very short neck,\" was about 6 - 6.5 ft. tall and had a \"medium build,\" meaning that it was neither thin nor particularly muscular that he noted. Its color was \"burnt orange to brown\" and the length of hair was uniform all over \"like a shaggy dog.\" The hands and feet appeared darker, but no details were remembered. This was witnessed by both the driver, age 50, and his son, age 14 at the time. The driver continued forward for two to three seconds after the sighting \"trying to process what he had seen.\" Then he thought to back up and check the woods where it had crossed, but \"there was nothing to be seen.\"   The second sighting occurred April 3rd, 2011. The witnesses were driving northeast on Hwy 155 toward Tyler at about 3 PM (initially reported as 5 PM). The son, now age 15, was in the passenger's seat and saw the animal first. He became very excited and brought the animal to his father's attention.  It was observed for maybe six to seven seconds by the son and \"only a second or two\" by the father. The animal was standing at the tree line to the right about 20-30 ft. off the road. It was visible from about the knees up and was very consistent with the first reported animal in height and coloring. The son insists that the second animal was \"more muscular,\" otherwise he was in agreement. The son added that it \"had a lot of hair on it's face,\" but you could see the skin. He stated the skin was about the color of a darker Hispanic person and that it had a \"wide nose\" and a \"big mouth.\" The father turned the truck around and walked to the woods in the area where he believed it was standing only a minute before. The son would not get out of the vehicle. The father says he walked beyond the tree line about 20-30 feet and stopped to listen. He did not hear or smell anything so he returned to the truck where his son was still visibly shaken. ",
