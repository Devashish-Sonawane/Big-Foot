I took my wife with me to help search out a deer I thought I may have wounded while hunting the prior evening.  There was plenty of snow in the Tuttle marsh that year so we were able to see even though it was 6:00 a.m. approximately.  A storm had been predicted for New Year's day and I knew if I was to have any chance of retrieving my deer, I would have to be out there early.",
