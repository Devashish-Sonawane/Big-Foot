It crossed the road in front of me in 2-3 steps, it stepped over a fence and went into a coastal field out of my vision. It was grayish color but everything in that area is covered in rock crusher dust so it could have been any color. This \"thing\" was not as hefty as the pictures on your site, but he was tall with long arms. He stood on two feet like a human with long arms and didn't run but was lumbering across the road.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness via telephone about his close encounter.  Even though it had been two years since the incident occurred, and I contacted him in a \u0093cold-call\u0094 fashion, the witness presented himself in a very credible manner.  As he had stated in his initial submission, the witness was \u0093getting off work and coming home.\u0094  It was approximately 0430 hours when he noticed something up ahead standing on the side of the road.  The witness\u0092s first impression, in an instant, was that of a cow, as his mind attempted to rationalize what he was seeing.  However, the witness then noticed that \u0093the thing was standing up like a human.\u0094  At that moment, it occurred to the witness that he was seeing something highly unusual and as he approached to within 50 feet, the creature \u0093took two to three strides in a fast walk\u0094 and was completely across the road.  The witness stated that he believed at that moment that he was seeing \u0093a bigfoot.\u0094  He said that it didn\u0092t make sense to him, but there it was, very plain and there was no mistaking it for anything else.  It was tall \u0096 approximately six to seven feet in height.  The bigfoot had \u0093an eye shine\u0094 as it looked at him while crossing the road but the witness could not remember a distinct color.  The witness stated that he had always heard that the hair of these creatures was brown, but the one he saw \u0093was definitely gray.\u0094  The witness attributed the gray coloration to \u0093dust from rock crushing.\u0094  Apparently there is a large facility nearby that crushes the limestone rock found in the area.  The rock crushing has the rather undesirable effect of giving dark colored objects a gray or off-white hue.  The witness went on to say that the hair of the creature was \u0093long but wasn\u0092t shaggy.\u0094  The witness said that the sighting happened so quickly that he was unable to discern any other details relating to face, hands, feet, etc. The witness stated that the animal cleared the road and \u0093stepped over the fence\u0094.  That was the last the witness saw of the animal.  The witness said, \u0093I started to turn around, but I just went on home.\u0094  I asked him if the sighting alarmed him.  The witness stated that it surprised him more than anything and that he was not frightened at all.  Summation:  Two years had lapsed since the witness reported this sighting, but he was still able to talk to me in a very confident and compelling way.  He was not hesitant at all in telling me of the encounter, even though he had endured some skepticism from his friends and co-workers.  I asked him if he had entertained the idea of a \u0093man in a monkey suit.\u0094  The witness unequivocally stated that it was a real animal and without question what he saw that morning \u0093was a bigfoot.\u0094 ",

I also noted as it walked, its legs at the knees were bent as it walked its legs never straightened out like a humans legs would. The arms of this bigfoot were long and swayed as he walked and he was very tall, i noted that he walked next to a tall sign on the highway and his shoulders were in line with the 55 mile speed limit highway sign on hwy 299. I would also say that this creature was around 7 to 8 foot in height, and about 500lbs, or more in weight.",
