            "Observed": "It was about 7:00 PM in September. It was still pretty light outside. My brother who had come home on leave from the military was visiting us. He and I had been target shooting north of Dunkirk in a heavily wooded area. After returning back to Dunkirk we heard what sound like a scream come from the woods we had been in. The sound was extremely loud and was coming over a 40 acre field. I released my German Shepard off his leash to see if he would go investigate what the sound was. The dog promptly went through the the front screen door of the house and refused to go back outside even though he was never allowed inside the house in the past. My brother wanted to investigate what it was. I decided discretion was the better part of valor and declined. The next morning we went back into the woods in the area we heard the noise and found several trees \"scratched\" at about the 6 foot mark above the ground. Much like a bear does to mark it's area. The only thing about it is there are no bears in Indiana.",
