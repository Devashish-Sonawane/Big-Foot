            "Follow-Up Report": "Several details can be added after a telephone interview with the witness.Shortly after dark, the witness was driving westbound and saw the figure three to four feet off the south side of the road. Although it was a very brief sighting of only two or three seconds as he passed by the figure, the witness claims to have gotten a fairly good look at it.  It was standing just past several road signs, one of which was a \"No Passing\" sign, and appeared to be about the same height as the signs, which he estimated to be about eight feet. The creature was facing south, giving him a left-side profile view, and did not move while in his sight. He mentioned the reddish-brown color to be much like the tree trunks in the area. The head was only visible as a hump as the figure appeared to be slouched over and slightly forward. The arm reached to its knee. He noticed hair that was several inches long on the thigh. He described the large figure as not fat, but lean.The immediate area is the highest in the Black Hills and in South Dakota at 6,000 - 7,000 feet in elevation and on the north slope of Harney Peak, the highest point in South Dakota and the Black Elk Wilderness Area. The witness mentioned that the sighting location is also a very common game-crossing area and the entire region seems to currently be over-populated with deer and elk. David Petti",

I do know the exact location. My friend was driving and all of the sudden he says \" dude, what is that in the rd?\" we got roughly 20 ft from the object and my friend turned on his high beams. When he did this the thing stood up in the middle of the rd and then ran very quickly up a hill. There is no doubt that it was either a Sasquatch or someone in a very large big foot suit. It ran up the hill on two feet and it looked like a kind of \"skip\" like a ape. Could not be a bear. There were other people that weekend that claimed to see it also. I am very certain of what we saw. I have looked on the internet and there are quite a few sightings in this area.  The terrain is similar to the terrain that I have seen on your show.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The area around this report is dominated by the Huron/Manistee National Forest. Established in 1938 and combined with the Huron National Forest in 1945, this area was created to \"change the lands that nobody wanted into healthy forests again.\" To a great extent this has happened, when one considers the diversity of species in the area.  Bordered on the South by the Muskegon River, and to the North by numerous swamps, this area contains many animal and plant species. The individuals in this report were leaving an outdoor concert around midnight and traveling on a winding road at a rate of about thirty miles per hour. The weather was warm, and the day had been clear and so it was this night. While negotiating the curves of the road, the driver saw something in his headlights and slowed down. He asked his passenger, \"What is that in the road?\" He continued to slow down and turned on his high beams. They both saw something that was \"huge and furry, crouched down in the middle of the road.\" They slowly eased up to within fifteen feet of it when the object of their attention stood up on two legs. It had been facing away and they had only seen the back of the figure. It turned to look at them, then quickly \"ran\" up a hill. Their car came to a complete stop in the middle of the road.  The figure was dark in coloration and approximately 7' tall. It covered the distance from the middle of the road and up the hill (about 80') in 8-10 steps. The description of the figure's movement was \"...similar to an ape, but very fast.\" It behaved as if it was trying to run fast on all fours but was, at times, missing steps with the front \"legs.\" The arms seemed to be much longer than a humans.  While the distance between the figure and the motorists was short, they did not get a good look at the face because \"the creature did not turn completely before running away.\"  Both witnesses remained in the car, but they did use the headlights to shine into the woods where the figure disappeared. They were convinced that this creature could have only been \"...a bigfoot or a great impersonator; there was no way it was a bear or any other animal.\"",
