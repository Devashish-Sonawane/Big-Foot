            "Follow-Up Report": "11/9/10 - The witness contacted me with more incidents. He reports that during August he was awakened during the night by a \"whooping\" call, repeated several times. Two weeks ago something slapped the side of his house around midnight, again loud enough to wake him from a deep sleep.He is acquainted with a law enforcement officer who reported a \"monkey without a tail\" crossed the road during one of his patrols. The officer reported nearly hitting the creature.A neighbor reported seeing an 8-foot tall creature creeping around her barn at daybreak. The animal was the apparent cause of horse and cattle feed sacks being taken at night. Two high school students still hunting in the 2009 season saw a sasquatch exiting what they considered an impenetrable thicket. It exited the brush and walked away from them apparently unaware of their presence.END   ----------------------------------------------------------------------Original report:Another investigator and I visited the witness on 22 AUG 2009. The terrain is very conducive to animals living undetected. The hills around the witness' dwelling have a 40 degree slope. The valley floor is approximately 125 yards wide, sharing space with houses, the single lane public highway and a meandering stream. His description of the power contained in the vocalizations he witnessed cannot be attributed to a known creature. The distance from his front porch to the area where the vocals emanated from is approximately 175 yards. He stated the volume was frightening. He was a police officer and has been involved in gunfights with criminals. This incident generated the most fearful reaction he has ever experienced.  I also interviewed his spouse and a neighbor during my visit. The neighbor stated he and others had experienced a loss of deer during bow hunting season. The exact words describing his loss were: \u0093I tracked that deer following a blood trail a blind man could see. I found where it had lain down, with a huge pool of blood. Then somehow the deer was gone, with no marks where it had been dragged off.\u0094  He is occasionally awakened by someone slapping the side of his house between 1 and 4 AM. The spouse remarked she had heard wood knocking and whooping calls at various times since they moved in two years ago. She has seen an upright biped watching her and their small children three times from an abandoned garage across the valley. She could not identify what it was due to the distance. Our original witness stated he was working on an automatic deer feeder when he heard the scream/roaring calls. His deer feeder was suspended off the ground about 12 feet. Something had pulled the feeder down bending the handles and ripping out the battery and dispenser wheel, throwing them in opposite directions, about 20 feet from the crumpled feeder. The feeder could hold 150 pounds of corn.  Other strange incidents:*Trash picked through- can lid removed, bag opened, and items sorted through with non-selected items neatly stacked on can lid.*Neighbor's grape arbor picked clean in one night. Grapes were removed by twisting the entire pod off the stem, even up to an 8-ft. height.*Dogs so frightened they would not leave their kennel. Wanted to return to the kennel and hide. *School bus driver reported an ape jumped on the bus roof while waiting for students (very old incident).",
