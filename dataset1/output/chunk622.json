My husband also observed suspicious activity as a youth 12-14 while hiking with his Uncle somewhere in the vicinity of Vincent/Harpersville (Shelby County) in the form of a huge noise about 40 yds from them as they stood in a creek and upon climbing out observed twisted branches about 2\" thick and uprooted bushes (which was taken as the \"huge\" sound they heard).

            "Observed": "01192008 Suspicious knocking was heard about 3:00 am as my husband was camping with  Boy Scouts  on the side of a ridge SE of Henderson Peak about 200 yds from State Rd. 281.  (topozone.com map 33\u00b0 27.85'N, 85\u00b0 52.21'W - across road from red #13 about 200 yds. ) This is just south of the Cheaha State Park line.  It was about 14 degrees with intermittent howling wind.  There were 3 sets of 2 knocks each about 100 yards north of the campsite described as \u0093a piece of firewood hitting another.\u0094  It was very loud and the knocks, though themselves rhythmic, were spaced so that the wind died down before they occurred again.   These were not little limbs hitting each other and he was not able to determine if there were any responses because of the wind.   There were no campers north of them and the only other campers on the mountain that were encountered was another Boy Scout troop camping about 4 miles away directly on Lake Chinobee.  My husband is an avid bfro.net browser (and hopeful member of a future BFRO expedition :-) who awoke and immediately felt that this was consistent with other knocking activity.  Due to the inclement conditions and not wanting to scare the younger kids in camp, he did not have a chance to follow up.  Although he didn\u0092t mention the sounds the next morning, another adult did, and with careful, roundabout questioning all other factors for the sounds were excluded (trees falling, wind, limbs hitting each other due to the wind, etc).  I am typing this since he was \u0093not sure\u0094 of the cause of the sounds and was reluctant to report something that may not have been genuine (since he wasn\u0092t able to go look for tracks).",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness recounted his experience to me in detail as described in the report. He said the sounds were three very distinct, extremely loud knocks of wood on wood. They did not correspond to wind gusts and were clearly heard over the wind and background noise generated by the wind. He said the sound would be what he would imagine if someone could hit two four-foot fence posts together. He did not mention the sounds to the other adults at breakfast but one of the two other adults brought up that he had been awakened by the noise. They could not agree on a common explanation for the noise.This area of the Talledaga National Forrest and Cheaha Mountain has a history of unexplained noises and sightings.",

As we approached the main line road we noticed this creature to the right.It was about 80 yards away,and it started moving away from us very fast.The creature disappeared around a bend in the road about 125yards away.We sat there for a half a minute looking at each other in disbelief.Then we took off down toward where he went around the bend.When we got there the creature was about 200 yards down the road.It looked back towards us and went into the brush.When we got down there we shut the truck off and could hear rustling brush for about 20 seconds,but we couldn't see it.That was that.I grew up my whole life out in the woods,hunting, fishing,and hiking.I know all the animals in the area well,we know what we saw.It was unbelievable,we were close enough to get a good look at it.I was 18 at the time,now Im 36 and i can still see its face,its body,and its walk.The creature was at least 7'-8' tall,with long brownish red hair.It was a sasquatch,for sure.We never really talked about it to many people.All i know is these things are out there.",
