            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witnesses at their home. Because of unusual sounds being heard by the witnesses I left an audio recorder with the hopes of recording howls that the witness had described. The site for the recorder was several hundred yards from the house in a secluded area of the timber. I visited the home three times to exchange audio recorders over a span of six weeks.  In summary:The son explained an incident in which he had been growled at in the woods near their home.The father told me how he had repeatedly heard long deep howls that reminded him of some of the sounds from this website. At first he thought they were of wolves but there had not been any sightings of wolves in this area.The father also had an incident where a very large animal had been in one of his oak trees. As the witness approached the animal screamed loudly, dropped from the large tree and ran back into the trees. As it was dark with poor lighting he was unable to see the animal.Just before daybreak the mother had recently had a strange happening while walking along the lane to the main road where her car was parked. She stated that she had been followed by something. She was convinced it was walking bipedally just across the road but it was hidden from her view by scrubs and trees. Although her husband tried to console her that it was \"just a deer\" she was sure it was something much larger.The father also described how he had heard wood knocks coming from the rear of the property. Upon reviewing the six weeks of audio I did record what appeared to be wood knocks at 2 a.m. on March 21, 2012.Possible wood knocks The witness asked the neighbor if he had been chopping wood, but the neighbor said he had not, having even converted his fireplace to gas.
