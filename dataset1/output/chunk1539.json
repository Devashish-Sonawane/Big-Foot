            "Also Noticed": "I went to retrieve a bobcat loader from clients at a job in Garrison NY. I went late with a large dump truck and hvy trailer. I pulled up to the house adjacent to the road leaving the truck running and lights on. I could smell a skunk like smell but thought nothing of it. I loaded the machine on the trailer, chained down one side crossed in front of the truck and noticed red eyes at about 75-100 ft down the road  looking back at me they seemed taller than 6' , just out of range of head lights. I quickly got the other side truck and chained the other side down and ran back to cab of the truck and saw the same eyes stairing back. I got into the cab and told the other person with me I had seen something. I looked up and the eyes had moved off into woods to the left.  My problem was there was no way to back down the road and I had to trough where this thing was standing.",
