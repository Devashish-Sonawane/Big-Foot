            "Observed": "My wife and I were wakened by the loudest vocalization I have ever heard , similar to a Peacock but much louder and more timber to its voice , there was no anxiety in its voice not a scream but more of a call , it called about 12 times then went silent I went outside and tried to mimic its call at which time it answered me about 6 times getting closer with each call , close enough that I felt uncomfortable enough to go back inside. I would say it went as far as the edge of my yard where it could have seen me through the trees and still remain unseen. The odd part about this is that not one of my 3 dogs barked they were very alert and tense. These dogs bark at the slightest provacation one of these dogs I had to fit with a bark collar to stop her nuisance barking",

            "Follow-Up Report": "K and N called my wife a few hours after the vocalizations have stopped that morning. I spoke with them that same night by phone and then made a site visit the following afternoon. This event took place 4 days past the Tianapam sighting (report # 4940,\u0093Morning sighting by three fishermen near the east end of Riffe Lake\u0094) not six miles away as the crow flies.K. and N. were very impressed by the massive volume this animal produced.  K. stepped out on the back porch and began to imitate the noise this animal made. Theanimal had quit vocalizing, but immediately began again upon K. imitation. The animal moved very swiftly in his direction, spooking K. back into the house.  K.  explained;\u0093That thing, came right to the edge of the tree line in our back yard. I am sure it could see me, but I could not see it.\u0094We scoured the trees looking for any sign of a large primate. There were scuff marks that could possibly have been tracks.  They seemed to be about 4-5 feet apart and the underbrush and understory had been disturbed. Something big had been there. Therealso are plenty of deer and elk that regularly visit their back yard.I played recorded vocalizations of reported sasquatches,  that matched the description they both described.  They both felt that the Puyallup and Snohomish  vocalizations were very much the same in their experience, with a few differences. This voice wasdeeper in tenor and had a \u0093throat clearing\u0094 at the end of it. I found behavior of the three dogs interesting in that they were very vocal and noisy the entire time we were there.  But K. and N. described them and very alert and nervous,but quite the entire time this thing was vocalizing.Update: as of 12/8/02 these vocalizations are still happening. But not as close to the house as it was that day.  N.  believed there is more than one of them and that the coyotes often join in the choirs effort.  There is also a wolf howl they have been able to identify. This could be a domesticated wolf gone wild again.",

            "Observed": "Well to begin, my uncle which lives across the street from my parents heard his dogs barking so he got a flashlight and went out in his pasture to check it out. He shined his flashlight to an old vehicle he has in the pasture and saw eyes. He just stood there trying to figure out what it was then he saw it turn and run. He said he beat the dogs back to the house it scared him bad. Well he called my parents telling them about it. They laughed at him and asked him if he had been drinking - he said no, it ran towards y'all. Well my dad went outside to see if he could see anything and he didn't find anything. We thought he was just joking till about a week later my mom went outside to throw something in the trash. She flipped on the porch light and had her back to the back pasture till she got a funny feeling something was wrong. She felt something staring at her. She turned around and all of a sudden my mom ran in the house shaking and crying, saying \"that SOB is out there!\" She panicked. I said, \"Mom what is it?\" She said, \"He wasn't lying, that thing is out there.\" My dad ran to the porch to see what it was but by that time it had already ran off. I asked my mom what it looked like after I finally calmed her down she said it was about 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall standing there kind of slumped over with his arms dangling, staring at her. She said the lights reflected off of it and its eyes were glowing red from the porch lights reflection. It looked like it had been bedding down in an old hog pen my parents have. It is in the woods not too far from the creek. Mom saw it twice. We have never told anybody about this cause we didn't want people to think we were crazy or stupid.",
