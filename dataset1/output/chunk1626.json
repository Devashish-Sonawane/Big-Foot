            "Observed": "This was so unreal, that I really hesitate to mention it.The spot is on Warbro Rd.East side, n.of ready mix co, across from Martin Marietta quarry.This short road runs N.from Hull St.(US 360),South from Genito Rd.(state rt.604). The area actually has a lot of real wilderness through out and nearby, marshes, creeks, deep woods. There has been some clearing of land East of the rd in question.The incident was about 9:30 pm, Fri.June 2nd. We had been to the theater, grabbed some food and were headed home. Driving N.on Warbro. My wife and myself saw something rushing along the edge of the woods, Southbound, it glided into the woods as we passed. I said to my wife-\"did you see that deer?\" She said-\"that was no deer!!!\" It was a silvery-white, tall, vertical, slender thing with what she called \"flowing\" hair. Our \"sighting\" was about 3 seconds. This would have been utterly dimissed as something unexplainable, except we went back there the next morning, walked up to a cleared area with some very soft, muddy places. My wife got some poison ivy for her efforts. We found quite a few tracks, TWO DISTINCT sizes. Long stride on the larger. They were atleast 15\"long and about 8\"at the wide end. There were distinct toe markings on some. The shorter foot was about 9\" long with a more \"human\"look to the shape. I should say that this area teems with deer, beaver, raccoons,etc. The whole thing is just unreal. You don't expect to see this within sight of a freakin' Walmart.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke on the phone with G.H. regarding his report, and the following details can be added:The area of the sighting has changed considerably, with increased industrial development and a new sports complex.This road used to be known for high numbers of road kill, particularly deer, and the witness recounts seeing 40-50 deer kills in this section. This night he had his brights on, and was travelling approximately 25mph, while watching for deer.He initially saw something out of the corner of his eye and assumed it was a deer, until he looked over to see a bipedal figure in a running motion. The figure was slightly ahead of the car on the passenger side, running in the opposite direction (southbound).  It made an immediate turn away (toward the east) into the dense woods when it was approximately even with the car. At this point he estimated the distance from the car to the figure was fifteen feet. The \u0093flowing hair\u0094 noticed by his wife was from the arms as they were moving in a running motion. The hair color seemed to have lighter patches, like highlights. He was unable to see feet or make out facial features or skin color. To him the figure was not \u0093bulky,\u0094 but more \u0093athletic.\u0094 He estimated its height to be seven feet.He was particularly struck by how fast and graceful the figure was, especially since it was moving through patches of thicker brush along the roadside.Upon return to the area during daylight, he noticed between 20 and 30 tracks, mostly in clear-cut area with clay soil. The tracks were varying sizes as mentioned, and on several tracks he could easily distinguish toes. His cell phone at the time did not have a camera, and he regrets not being able to take a picture of the tracks. Rain shortly after this precluded a return visit to the site with a camera, as he thought the tracks would likely have been washed away.No unusual odors or sounds noted during encounter or upon return to area.During our discussion of his report, I found G.H. to be a credible witness. There have been reports of other sasquatch activity in this local region, and the high frequency of road kill would possibly make this road attractive for picking up an easy meal.",

We were way up 171st when on the side of the road standing next to a street sign was a large shape.  As the head lights hit it, it was apparent there was a large creature that was not a bear standing next to the road.  The side shine of the lights kept it lit until we passed.  Even though I know it could not see inside the car, It felt like my eyes were locked on its as we drove by.  I spun in the seat and was looking behind us.  It walked up on the road paused to look and the light of the moon illuminated it fairly well.  It walked down the other side.  My mother asked if I saw that.  I said yes... she asked if i wanted her to turn around... at the time I said no.",
