We do have some black bear here and there.  The encounter/sighting was only for a few seconds as I drove by with high beams on.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke at great length with the witness about his roadside sighting and lots of other strange things he has encountered near Lake James, just outside of Morganton, North Carolina.The sighting took place on Frank Whisnant Road,on his way home from night fishing at Lake James, which is very close to Morganton. He was accompanied by his Aunt who did not see the creature. It was between 1:30 and 2 a.m. He spotted something on the side of the road, behind the guardrail. The embankment it was standing on behind the guardrail is very steep, and would be very hard for anything other than a biped to stand on. He only saw it from the shoulders up. He stated it had neatly maintained hair four to six inches long,and was a reddish brown in color. It had very broad shoulders and had to be very tall due to the steepness of the embankment, and the fact its head and shoulders were visible above the guardrail. Its facial features were human like, but the nose was described as not flat like an ape, and had a slight bridge.The skin was darker than the body hair. The entire sighting lasted five to ten seconds.The witness has also viewed an upright creature jump into Lake James at the Linville Access Area. He stated a large upright creature jumped off an 8 ft. cliff into the water and was thrashing around like it was trying to catch another animal.He has also heard limbs and trees being broken and strange howls in the same location.Lake James and the surrounding area is in the Pisgah National Forest. There is abundant wildlife and waterways in the area. There has been lots of Sasquatch activity reported in this area.",
