            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with our witness W.N. on the afternoon of February 16, 2009, about he and his wife's brief experiences in June of 2008 while they were working at their gold claim, and camping out in a wilderness area. W.N. seemed very astute and credible in talking about their experiences that occurred to them while on their claim in southern Oregon. On several different occasions while the witness and his wife were spending several days and nights out on their claim last summer, they had the opportunity to hear what the witness believed to be wood on wood knocks close to their camp. The wife tried to justify those sounds as tree embers still cooling down from the \"Biscuit\" fire, but in all reality that fire had long ago been put down due to several years of winter rains.  The Biscuit fire was one of the largest in that part of Oregon.  This fire burned over 500,000 acres in the area of their claim. He explained to her that the fire had been out for several years and through several winters, so the burned trees could not be making those sounds.What can be added to this report, and was a strange happening, was the fact that during those two days while the wood knocking was taking place, they had several deer come down into their camp and just seemed to hang around; almost close enough to touch, which had never happened to them before. Those burned areas do draw many wild animals after several years, especially deer, because of the new growth.Prior to last year's BFRO expedition in southern Oregon, the wife and I had the opportunity to drive up into this area, just checking on locations where our large friends might be hanging out.  This area seems to be recuperating very well from that very large \"Biscuit\" fire that occurred several years ago. Please note that this area of Oregon also has a reputation for many Class \"A\" and Class \"B\" encounters in the recent past.The main reason this investigator thinks there is a good possibility the knocking sounds were being made by sasquatches, is the behavior of the deer around the couple.",
