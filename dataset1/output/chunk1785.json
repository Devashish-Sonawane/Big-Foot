He reported the source of the eye shine was never revealed by direct observation. He and his friend estimated the height from about 40 feet away, then proceeded to the spot the creature observed them from and confirmed the estimated height.The unknown creature was human-size but not human. The eye shine is not characteristic of humans in the visible spectrum, nor would being illuminated by a spotlight without protest. Night hunting is a normal activity for this part of the country. I can imagine no person who would have a spotlight directed at them without a verbal challenge of some sort. First impulse would be to say: \"Don't shoot!\"Since the creatures were not observed directly we cannot say for certain what creatures were present. Only that they displayed curiosity and a lack of fear toward dog and man. ",
