            "Observed": "Friday Oct 22, 9:40 pm I had just left our local school homecoming football game in Springdale Washington, with 2 of my children and a friend of theirs (2 High School freshman and a mid schooler). We were driving south on Highway 231 and as we approached Sanctuary Way (47.9763678, -117.7323568) just off the highway in the ditch I noticed a very large black \"thing\" in the tall yellow, uncut grass. I initially thought it may be a black wolf, so i slowed down and stared at it as we approached. By the time we drove to it, we were traveling about 35-40 MPH.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness Rudy Peone by phone. He is credible and available to speak with local journalists about this recent incident, 25 miles northwest of Spokane.The incident happened at night but there were multiple witnesses. The other witnesses were children who were facing each other and talking when the figure first came into the drivers view. They turned to look just as the vehicle was passing the figure. They didn\u0092t see the same amount of details as the driver but they did all see a big dark figure among the yellow grass, illuminated peripherally by the headlights. They also saw that the figure was no longer there when the driver eventually turned around and drove back for a second look.The driver, Rudy, said the figure was apparently sitting on the edge of the ditch roughly three feet from the edge of the road. It was facing north. It\u0092s back was facing south. The road runs diagonally SW to NE in that section, so the figure would have seen vehicles approaching from the north.Rudy said it stepped away from the ditch edge and into the ditch as it was still haunched over, as if it was trying to avoid the headlights. Then it turned to watch as the vehicle passed by.He is certain that it walked on two legs and has two arms and hands and a head more like a human than a bear or wolf.",

The campground is on a rise overlooking a meadow with Lee Vining creek running through the midst.  As one progresses westward up the canyon, one enters lodgepole pine forest.  Eventually, the trail that the campground is on rises out of the valley through the alpine tundra scrub, granite domes, cliffs, and rock falls to the top of 12,500 foot Mt. Conness, which crowns the Sierra crest west of the camp.  I took many digital photos of the area around our camp.",

They were in a remotely placed campgroud, sitting around camp with no fire. The calls seemed to be about 1.5 miles away from them (very close to a water source) and were very loud, echoing through the surrounding canyon. There were roughly ten (10) \"whoop-howls\" in all and each had a small pause between each call. They sounded very much like the Puyallup and Snohomish that are archived on the BFRO website. There were no responses to the calls, but the reporter noted that he was struck by the fact that all forest sounds stopped during and after the calls. The reporter and his sister grew up in the Sierras and have had extensive interaction with the area and the outdooors in general. Neither one had ever never heard anything like it before.",
