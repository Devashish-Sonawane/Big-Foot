She said the last occurrence that she can recall would have been in the early 1990's. When she had a feeling of someone watching her and the \"hair on the back of your neck standing up feeling, and that whatever is watching you wants you to leave\". She said, that also was the feeling she had back in 79' or 80'. The sounds she has heard are as follows: A high pitched whistle, an almost shriek sound, huffing noises, and something large moving through the underbrush and a screaming noise that her great aunt heard who also lived out there.I asked her to listen to the sounds that I had and she said that they sound similar to some of them, but couldn't swear that they are identical.She also said she didn't smell any strange smells at the timeSince her parents still live out there, I asked her to keep her ears and eyes open if something new develops.",
