            "Observed": "Late one night when I was around 11 or 12 years old.  I was awaken by something at the window of my bedroom.  As I woke up and looked around my room the light from the street light in the back yard cast a shadow on my window.  This shadow filled the entire 8 foot window and had it was the shadow of something walking by.  The outline line looked like a big person with its head leaning forward and messy hair. At that time I though who is in my yard (as we had 6 acres of woods that backed up to rogully swamp and flaggon was near by).  So I got up and went to  the back door and stepped out to see who was out there. What I saw was something big and black that stepped over the 4 1/2 chain link fence and walked into the woods.  I did not know what I was looking at, but we lived rurally and our house set about an acre off the road.  Being in the late 70's the area was not developed.  So I could not imagine it being a person.  When I told my dad about it, he told me it was nothing and not to worry about it.  So for years I put it out of my mind.  To this day I am not sure what I saw.  All I know is it filled up the 8 foot window and stepped over a 4 1/2 foot chain link fence.  In my mind today that has got to be pretty big to do that.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "  I met with the witness in person near the incident. The witness believes the creature crossed his backyard as if it was taking a shortcut through the neighborhood to the forest behind his house. The witness saw the shadow move by his window and raced through the house to get a good look at the creature through the back door. His back porch light illuminated the creature as it crossed his yard. It was 300-500 pounds, eight feet tall and built like a linebacker. Its conical shaped head sat on top of the shoulders and was tilted forward. The body was covered in black shaggy hair. The arms had a pronounced swing. He saw the creature for approximately 3-4 seconds.The creature was spotted heading towards a wilderness area that extends into the Catahoula district of Kisatchie National Forest which is only three miles from the incident.
