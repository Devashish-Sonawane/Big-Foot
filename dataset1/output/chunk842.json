At approx 9:30-10:00 I stopped for gas in a small town just north of Redding, CA. I departed and continued heading north to Edgewood. I was searching for another exit, one with food, however I didn't find one, so I exited and drove out about 1-2 miles on a paved highway that turned into dirt without warning. (Off Edgewood road). I pulled my car over, and got out some food I had taken incase I couldn't find a restaraunt. I proceeded to eat, and take a short nap. I awoke about 1:30AM to the sound of something hitting my car from what I thought to be the front. I got out to look around and found a rock had hit my vehicle in the hood area. I found this very odd, and thought maybe some kids were playing around. I re-entered my vehicle, started it up again, turned on the lights, and to my utter surprise infront of me was a creature (for lack of a better term) just in the range of my headlights.",
