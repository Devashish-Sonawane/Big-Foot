I was a logger for 15 years, in and around northern California, and I was a timber faller, probably 5 years out of that period. Timber falling puts you out in the really remote areas, and we were always the first guys in there to drop the timber. I started working a real thick area, and began working my way back threw the thick woods, my plan was to reach the very back portion of the sale, and then cut my way back toward the logging road.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Today, on the 7th of December of 2002, I contacted a Robert D. and in a very sincere and believable manner he went over his report that he turned in a few months back.  One of the first questions that I had to ask him was, \"What is a cruiser?\"  His answer was \u201cHe is the person who marks the trees to be cut down, and he is also the one who marks the trees that are to be saved.\u201d The tracks that Robert first came across, looked to be human with no separate toes showing, because they were in very wet mud.  The tracks were not that of a bear, but more human like, because they were larger and deeper.  Also, Robert followed them for about a \u00bc mile, and the distance between the tracks was approximately five to six feet.  The scat was dark in color and had hair mixed in with it, and it was large and human looking.I asked Robert a few more specific questions about the creature. *\tWhat distance would you estimate you were from this thing when you first saw it?  \u201cI was about 100 yards from it, and it was squatting behind a large buck brush bush.\"*\tWhat was your first reaction?  \u201cMy first thoughts were it was a DFG person checking on hunters in that area, but after giving it a quick glance through my rifle scope it was not a person that I was accustomed to looking at.  My dog was acting very strange, like wanting to leave the area right now, and its hair was standing straight up on its back.\u201d*\tWhat was it doing?  \u201cIt was just staring at me and my dog.  The only movement that I saw, that it was trying to squat a little closer behind the bush.\u201d  *\tWas it covered in hair, and what color was it?  \u201cYes as much of it as I saw, and the color of it was a dark brown.\u201d*\tHow tall would you estimate this thing to have been?  \u201cCouldn\u2019t tell, because it was squatting, but the bush was large, and it couldn\u2019t really hide very well.\u201d*\tWhat would you estimate its weight to have been?  \u201cThis is just an estimate, but I thought it weighed about four to five hundred pounds.\u201d*\tDid you see any facial features, and could you describe them?  \u201cYes!  The eyes were the most telling.  They were not round like an ape, but looked more human-like. Also, I noticed the skin on the face was black, and the eyebrows reminded me of Eddie Munster, because they were straight across the forehead.\u201d \t\t*\tDid you observe any ears?  \u201cNo!\u201d*\tCould you describe the arms, legs or any other part of its anatomy?  \u201cNo!\u201d*\tCould you tell if it was a male or a female?  \u201cNo!\u201d*\tFor about how long did you see it?  \u201cFor a total time of about ten to fifteen seconds.\u201d                                *          Did it see you?  \u201cYes! It was staring straight at us, the dog and I.\u201d \t*          Did you smell anything?  \u201cYes!  The area smelled of an old man\u2019s body odor, but much more potent.  It almost made me gag!  The odor during the logging incident smelled like a filthy wet dog.\" *\tDid you check for footprints?  \u201cNo, not after the sighting.  I was too shook-up to go back to that area right away.\u201d*\tDid you report what you saw?  \u201cOnly confided in my uncle, who believed in what I told him about the sighting.\u201d *\tWhat was his response?  \u201cMy uncle spent his last years of his life investigating that area, because of the strange lights at night, and the sasquatch possibilities.*\tDid it ever make any noise?  \u201cNo!\u201d\tIn summary:  Robert D. thinks that this creature is more of a human than it is an animal.  I believe that Robert had a visual sighting back in October of 1979, because he is a very experienced outdoor person who has prospected and hunted for minerals most of his life.  Robert had a very bad feeling about this creature, and that\u2019s why he had to leave that area. His legs were leaving, so he thought he had better follow. ",

            "Observed": "Hello, I contacted someone from your organization about a year ago regarding my encounter in central Florida back in the middle 80s. I was called away to work and was unable to continue with the call. With that said, I would like to finish sharing my experience. I was working as a fence contractor in central FL during the 80s. We had obtained a job to build 10 feed plots for deer in a remote area off of hwy. 44 near the Blackwater Creek area of the Wekiva River Basin. The acreage is vast and was utilized for big game hunting. Since there was a deadline, we had all of the fence material trucked in and we set up camp at the end of the access road. This allowed us to be onsite until all work was complete. On the second day of our stay, we (myself and a helper) were surveying and clearing a fence line in the early morning hours, it was still misty with little light coming through the trees. There was four of us total working, so we split up into two teams to knock out the 10 plots. While my helper and I were clearing brush we were commenting and joking about an odd odor (skunky/sulfer like) we had been smelling a few minutes before reaching the site of the first plot. As we were pulling a string line, abruptly, a dark, bipedal form stepped into our fence line about 60 yards ahead of us. At first we thought it was one of the installers working with us, but as it moved closer to the clearing you could clearly see it was not a human. It appeared to be mostly covered with orange/brown hair, un-human long arms and an odd shaped head (wide, pointy and large) with a very short neck. Once it stepped out, it seen us as well, and when we shouted out the names of the other workers it quickly vanished into the treeline. We viewed the creature for what seemed to be 60 seconds or so before it bolted off. My helper and I were stunned at what we had seen. We spent a few minutes trying to rationalize it but there was no doubt we witnessed something extraordinary. I was carrying a side arm so we walked up to the clearing but could not see anything through the trees, however we did hear something moving rapidly away from us for a few seconds. That was the first of two encounters. The second encounter happened on the fourth night of our stay. All four of us were at camp which was set up on the bank of Blackwater Creek, about 15 feet from the waters edge. That area of the creek is approximatly 12 feet in width from bank to bank. We had began to cook dinner and were still carrying on conversations about our sighting of a hairy creature two days prior, with the other installers ribbing us saying we must had been drinking on the job and such. There was a cooler that we had tied to a rope and placed in the creek to keep the contents cool. As we were eating a loud splash from across the creek startled everyone. One of the other installers ran down to the creek and found that our cooler was gone, as well as the rope and stick it was tied to. We all walked down to the creek bank but there was no sounds other than the normal water movement. The missing cooler was chalked up to raccoons or an alligator. As we settled back into eating, one of the guys walked away to relieve himself, as he returned to the truck everyone looked at him, he was silent and all the color was gone from his face, he just looked at me and said \"I'm sorry, I will never doubt anything you tell me again, ever\". Not sure what he meant at the time, I asked him what happened, he quietly turned and pointed, saying \"someone or something was standing on the other side of the creek watching me pee\". It was obvious he was actually scared speechless. I grabbed a spotlight and we all walked down to the spot where he was standing. As I was hitting the treeline with the light there was no sight of any movements, eyeshine or anything so I stepped as close to the waters edge as I could. As soon as I turned the light back on and the beam hit the other side of the creek, we heard a loud grunt, almost similar to a pig, I panned to our left and that's when it all happened. A large bipedal, hair covered animal stood up from behind a group of palmetto bushes. It stood fully erect, the light shine of the eyes were almost gold, it reacted to the light hitting its eyes like a person would, by throwing it's forearm up in front of its face, let out a chilling sound (not a grunt, more like a short howl) unlike anything any of us had heard, it then turned and fled, vanishing like before. All of that happened in just seconds and all four of us witnessed it. We immediately packed up our gear, went to a motel and stayed at the motel until the job was finished. Three of us later went to the FL fish and wildlife office and reported what we had seen. It was during that report when I first heard the term \"skunk ape\" or even that there had been other sightings of this type. I can honestly tell you, without any doubt, it was not mistaken identity. I grew up as a hunter and outdoorsman and I know what bears look like and also how they act in the wild, it was not a bear, it was definately a primate of some type. Till this day I am effected by the encounters.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness - a Manager, and his crew was contracted to put up a barbed wire fence that facilitated the owners of the property for hunting. Because the fence was so large the men decided to camp on the property for a week\u0092s time.  The first day was uneventful, but that night a noise described as a \u0093squealing whoop\u0094 was heard at dusk.  After some discussion, the men could not identify the animal sound and it was forgotten. The next day all the equipment arrived and camp was set up. The second day, they woke up early and began to clear an area for the fence posts.  While they were running a string, they smelled a foul \u0093sulphury- musky \u0093smell and joked, blaming each other for the smell.  Shortly after that, the Manager and another worker noticed what they thought was a fellow worker about 60 yards away standing in the tree line. They yelled out to him and quickly realized it wasn't one of them. The bipedal individual looked at them when they yelled, and walked out of the tree line into a better view.  It was about 6 feet in height and stood initially with its hands placed on its chest, so the elbows were sticking out. This enabled them to see that the hair on its arms hung several inches long. The coloring of the creature was brownish-red. When it dropped its arms to its side, they hung past the knees.  It turned and looked at them: its face was described as long and \u0093ape-like,\u0094 but with a human nose. Its face appeared darker than its body. (Witness was unsure if it was skin or hair that made it appear darker.) It then walked away with purpose, and he noticed it had a protruding forehead, a short neck and it seemed to have a \u0093hunched back.\u0094  It walked back into the trees and just camouflaged right into it.  The Manager assumed at first that a gorilla must have escaped. The worker, a South American native said out loud, \u0093El viejo hombre de las monta\u00f1as!\u0094 - \u0093It is the old man of the mountains!\u0094 He had heard of a bigfoot type legend from his native country, Columbia. Both men being of the outdoor type, went fearlessly to investigate. They found a game trail where it had come from and returned to. The odor they had smelled earlier was stronger there, and they could hear something moving away from them. They shared the story with the others and continued working.  One worker in particular took pleasure in the continuation of teasing them about \u0093the Wildman\". Three nights later during dinner, a splash was heard. One of the men investigated and had found that the cooler full of cold cuts they had tied to a tree was gone.  The cooler had been placed in the river to keep it cool. They looked and found no trace of the rope or cooler. Thinking a bear, alligator or raccoon would have chewed the rope and destroyed the cooler, they thought it odd there was no trace of either anywhere.  It seemed something had untied the rope and took both.  After dinner, at camp the particular worker that had teased them walked out of camp to do his business near the river\u0092s edge. When he returned, the Manager claimed he was very quiet and looked as if he\u0092d seen a ghost.  It was clear to all something had happened. He quietly said, \u0093I will never make fun of you guys again. There is someone out there, on the other side of the creek.\u0094  The men grabbed flash lights, and began to smell the odor again as they were lead to the spot. From across the Blackwater Creek (about 15 feet across) they saw a dark bipedal figure. The flashlights returned orange/red eye shine.  The creature put its forearm up, attempting to block the light and let out a very deep, loud, guttural noise.  The Manager described the noise as deeper than a wild boar. The creature backed away from the light and disappeared into the woods. The sulphur type odor hung in the air. At that time, the men agreed to pack up the camp and go to a hotel. They didn\u0092t want to spend the night with the strange creature so close.  The next morning they returned, and found human like, but smeared foot prints. Later, three of the men spoke to a Fish and Wildlife officer. He was the person who suggested they had seen a Skunk Ape. Up until that time none of the men had heard that term before. This encounter occurred near the Seminole Forest WMA , Seminole State Forest and Wekiva River basin. These areas run together and create over 12,000 acres of swamp, scrub, pine woods and springs. It has an abundance of all types of native wildlife.  An area very near this encounter is under continued investigation by BFRO. ",
