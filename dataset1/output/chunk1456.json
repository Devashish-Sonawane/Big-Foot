            "Observed": "I grew up in Cayuse over the hill from St. Andrew's. Our Pa would not let us sleep outside in summer time. He said there were too many things we didn't know about that he couldn't trust. Us kids would always wonder but would respectfully obey. Well, onwards to a few years ago. It was during [Pendleton] Round Up and I was getting home to very late in the morning. Probably about 3am. My friend and I were sitting in the car planning for the next day. The engine was running but the lights were off. After several minutes of planning and laughing around, I was ready to head into the house. There are no lights around the house and no moon, so it was pretty dark out there. So my friend turned his headlights on so I could see my way to the front door. As soon as the car lights came on, this HUGE, slender built man went sprinting across the back yard! He was HUMUNGOUS... His head must of been right at the level of the corner of the house. He ran so fast, my mind wasn't sure my eyes had seen what they thought they did. I asked my friend \"Did you see that?\" He, of course, was occupied with his stereo and missed it. I said good night and went on in the house. I kept playing the scene over and over in my mind. The Big Guy was so damn fast... Like 40 yards before I could even blink. His legs didn't seem to stretch out straight like we people do. His head seemed to be sitting right on his shoulders. No neck that I can remember. He was of a darker color brown. The hair covered his body and appeared short. That's all I remember of that night.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness described an additional chain of events. One corner of the house, near their basketball hoop, had a light on a post fixed to the corner of the house and well above it, at a height of about 9'. This light was broken and somebody climbed on the roof to replace it. The light was broken again the next day. It was replaced repeatedly at nightly intervals and eventually the light bulb was found to have been unscrewed. She also found a 20\" footprint in a soft area a little distance from the house subsequently.-------------------------------------------------------Editor's note:  This report is from a native American woman with several stories from this part of Oregon.

            "Observed": "I was outside one morning with my daughter and we were picking up pecans in the yard under the trees.  After about 30 minutes I heard the sound of pigs squealing, screaming.  I looked up and peered through the trees to the wooded back yard of our nearest neighbor.  They had some pigs in a pen at the back of their yard just on the edge of the woods.  I looked in that direction and saw standing there at the edge of their pen, a creature much bigger than a bear or a man.  It was at least about 8 to 10 ft. Tall and was holding one of the baby pigs in its arms.  Holding it close to its chest.  It was hairy like a bear but had a human type face.  I froze and it froze and we both stared at each other, then somehow I thought of my daughter and her safety and I immediately grabbed her and ran inside screaming at my husband to get his gun, there was a Bigfoot outside.  I was hysterical and afraid.  My fear caused him to grab his rifle and run out to investigate.  Of course it was gone.  To this day my husband tells me it was a bear.  But I know better.  I know the difference between the face of a bear and a person, or something like a person.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Creature observed by witness was described to me as very large, muscular, black or dark brown with grey in color. Having longish hair rather than fur. She observed the hair on the head being somewhat long, and the creature having a human looking face with no hair on it. It stood erect on two legs, not moving just staring directly at her. The creature held a squealing baby pig in its arms, up against its chest in a cradle like fashion. The witness and the creature had direct visual contact for 15 seconds before she broke away to run into the house. It never turned away, never broke eye contact with her.She never heard approaching footsteps or noise of any kind, indicating something had come into the neighbor's yard, though the creature was only 25 yards away from her when she observed it. The witness is a modest and honorable individual that is left with an encounter that is imprinted vividly in her mind to this day, even after 34 years. Initially hesitant to speak in great detail for fear of ridicule, she opened up to me and revealed details of this encounter after I assured her of her anonymity. Adding to her credibility is her husband, a retired police officer of 34 years. Though he jokingly told her she saw a bear, he told me when speaking to me by phone, that he knew that his wife had seen a very large creature that day that was not a bear. He said she went into a temporary shock, and by the look on her face, and manner of her speech, knew she was telling the truth. Her husband assured me of his ability to know the difference when one is telling the truth, confused, or lying, based on his years of police experience and training.",
