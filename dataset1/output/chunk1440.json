            "Observed": "Well I have collected enough information from various bigfoot sites about screams to conclude that I heard a sasquatch on a bicycle touring trip from Portland, OR to Santa Barbara, CA in the summer of 1981. My girlfriend & I arrived at Fort Ross Historical Park north of Jenner, CA in Sonoma County on an evening in early July. We decided to camp there at Fort Ross as it was marked as a campsite on our map, but it had no campsites. There was no one at the main house nor around the fort (Old Russian Fur Trading Fort) or on any part of the grounds. We rode to a campground further south but it was too expensive & we decided to ride back to Fort Ross. We camped to the left of the upper parking lot under some monterey pines next to a picnic bench. We ate dinner & went to bed at around 9 p.m.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness by phone.  The following details can be added to the report.--Scream was extremely loud, obviously from something very large with a big lung capacity.--The scream lasted about 9 seconds and started in a guttural scream, turned to some sort of gibberish, then to a high pitch, ending in a low, deep pitch.--There were no lights (from other campers) and the area was quiet right after the scream.--As the witness finally settled down to go back to sleep, he heard the exact same scream again, but further away.--Witness later felt that the scream came from the gully next to where they were camped.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length by phone on February 16, 2002.  He was very helpful, and was very familiar with the area the incidents occured in.  He is also an experienced outdoorsman.  I should first note that the track find was during Elk Archery Season in early September of 2000, and the vocalizations were heard during the same time period in 1999.The track they found in September of 2000 was located on the east side of FR 88, where it crosses Meadow Creek, about 1 mile SE of the FR 88/FR 8851 Junction.  The track sat on the south side of the creek, about 10 yards from the road, near a wildlife trail.  The soil was a soft, sandy mixture that left a good, but not very distinct track.  Toe marks were not evident in the track, but it had the appearance of a \"big, gnarly foot.\"  The witness did not measure the track at the time, but he did place his foot next to it for comparison.  He estimates that the track was about 14-15 inches long, and 6-7 inches wide.   Also, the track impression was fairly deep.  The witness, who weighed about 225 lbs., said that his print went only about half as deep as the track they'd found.The vocalization heard by his hunting partner in 1999 took place a few miles west of the track location, near the north end of the Indian Heaven Wilderness.  The other witness had placed a tree stand for hunting elk just a few hundred yards NW of the FR 30/ FR 24 Junction, near Cayuse Meadow, which sits just a couple of miles west of the where the BFRO's Skookum Meadow Expedition discovered a sasquatch impression in September of 2000.   The stand was set in dark, old-growth forest on the south side of Cayuse Meadow.  The next day, while sitting in the stand, the witness began to hear the vocalizations and banging sounds.  It was near dark in the evening when this started.  The witness had been in his stand for quite sometime at this point, remaining completely still and quiet.  He had also masked his scent with elk lure.  The witness, also a very experienced hunter and outdoorsman, states that he has never heard anything like that sound, and is certain that it was not made by any other animal that he is familiar with.  The witness immediately departed the area, somewhat shook-up by the incident.",
