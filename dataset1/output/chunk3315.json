            "Observed": "I was a Deputy Sheriff for Marion County from 1970 to 1982.  In about 1977, I was dispatched to a reported shooting incident on the Little North Fork Rd., East of Salem and northwest of Gates.  The incident involved four young men who were college geology students, camping near the old mining town of Jawbone Flats doing some college work.  They were at their camp around 10:00 at night when they heard a howling noise coming from the canyon below their camp site.  They later heard the sound of a large animal coming up out of the canyon towards the road near their campsite. They had dogs with them that became scared and hid in the tent.  One of the men got a rifle out of the tent and they all went onto the road to try and see what the animal was.  When the animal got onto the road, they could not see it clearly as the area was only lit by the light of the moon and the camp fire but they could see the basic outline of the animal.  They described it as being huge, maybe eight feet tall and standing on two legs.  The animal started coming towards them which, of course, scared them and the young man with the gun fired at it several times.  The animal stopped and then crossed the road and continued up the canyon on the other side of the road making a lot of noise as it crashed through the brush.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The very cooperative witness helped substantially to define the location where the incident occurred. He examined the footprints below, on and above the road but could find none that were definitive in their appearance. However, the step length of the track effectively ruled out a human origin. He was impressed by how extremely scared the students were after the event. The location is about a mile and a half east of Henline Mt. The reports of law enforcement personnel, as in this case, have a most laudable precision and completeness about them.",

I traveled Howell Hill Rd to Teal Hollow Rd.  On Teal Hollow Rd I was speeding down a long straight away and saw something on the side of the road.  I thought it was a deer or cow at first, so I slowed down.  As I got closer to it, it stood up.  As I passed it I was still going fast, about 55 or 60.  I then thought it was a person who had crashed their car so I hit my brakes.  By this time I was past it.  I stoped in the road about 100 to 200 yards past it.  When I put the car in reverse to back up I could see that it had walked into the road behind me.  I probably got to within 25 to 30 yards of it when I realized it was much bigger than a person. It was dark so I do not have a great description. It scared me.  I threw the car in drive and floored it.  I drove like a bat out of heck until I got to HWY 64.  When I got home I was still shaking and still had tears in my eyes.  I do not know what I saw, but it was big, looked to be 6 1/2 to 7ft and almost half the width of my car.  20 yrs have past and I still will not drive that road anytime close to dark.  I get cold chills everytime I think about what happened.  It scared the heck out of me, whatever it was",
