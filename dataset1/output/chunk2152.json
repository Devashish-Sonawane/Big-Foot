I found the witness to be forthright and very curious about sasquatch. He took me to the exact spot where he had the encounter. The animal was standing facing away from the witness in a small field between two houses. The witness said the animal appeared very dark and he could see the general shape and outline in the moonlight and starlight. The animal turned slightly and looked toward the witness and after a few seconds began to scream and ran on two legs into the wood line crashing and snapping brush. The young man could see definite arm swing when the animal ran. The screaming lasted well over thirty seconds. The witness was very frightened and quickly continued on to his friend's house. The witness said the creature was seven and a half to eight feet tallThis area is in the French Broad River valley, with lots of farmlands and large forest tracts. The Blue Ridge Parkway and Pisgah National Forest are nearby. I believe this young man had a real experience with a sasquatch.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness at length by phone only three days after the event. His recollection of all that occurred was very fresh and detailed. He is an avid outdoorsman, spending lots of time hiking and camping. He has never had anything like this occur in all of his years in the wilderness.The campground was very full due to leaf watchers as Fall colors are at peak.He and his wife heard sounds on Friday night that were quite odd. They first heard coyotes howling, then right after they heard a single vocalizer that sounded entirely different than the coyotes. It was much deeper and louder and did not sound like a canine. He said it had more of a deep and wailing sound, and the coyotes were \"yipping\" in a group. He and his wife did not pay it much attention until the events of early Sunday morning.The branch breaking started at 2:30am and lasted 45 minutes to one hour. There were at least two animals as the branch breaking was taking place over his right shoulder at eleven o'clock, then at one o'clock. He heard a loud vocalization that he described as \"very deep and guttural\" from a huge creature that he said was so loud that he thought the animal was \"20 feet tall\". He said it sounded very similar to a deer \"blowing\" an alarm, but much deeper, longer, like a sigh. The limb breaking then continued over both shoulders. The limbs being broken were both large and small.He and his wife listened and pondered what was doing it, he told me he didn't tell his wife but he suspected it was by a Sasquatch. It continued until this extremely loud wood break occurred. They had dogs with them but the dogs didn't respond in any way at the noises.The next morning they went and looked for limbs, footprints or other evidence and found nothing. They did notice some odd rock piles, two were very old one was younger. They also noticed lots of mushrooms with the tops eaten, but the stems were discarded. The witness was skeptical of the possible existence of Sasquatch, but now fully believes in their existence. He is very curious about them and he now looks at the woods in a different light.This is my second hammock camping incident in the Uwharries, see Report#47026.The Uwharries continue to be an active area with Montgomery County having the most reports in North Carolina. There is abundant wildlife, forests, agriculture and waterways to support a large bipedal primate.",
