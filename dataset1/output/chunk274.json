            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with this witness on the phone. The witness was 11 at the time of the events in the report, she is 21 now.  She did a very good job with her report.  I asked her a few more pointed questions, but was not able to get much more detail, as she reported everything she saw, and it has been 10 years since it happened.  The really interesting thing about this report is she may have actually got to see a sasquatch chasing a deer while moving as a quadruped for an extended period of time.  The reaction of the deer is identical to the reaction of deer we observed at a resort in the North Olympics in October 2009 when a person in our group saw a sasquatch that was near a group of deer that were feeding on apples.  At the first sight of the sasquatch, the deer went into high alert and then full flight mode and ran right by people at top speed. She remarked how extremely fast the sasquatch was able to run on all fours and that it was actually gaining on the deer.  At the time, the witness didn\u0092t know what kind of animal it was.  Somehow the deer knew to get under a bright light at the power substation and that the sasquatch would not follow.  She said that after the creature gave up and began walking on all fours back to the south across the graveyard it was about halfway through the graveyard when to her astonishment, it stood up and walked as a human. She said the gait was with a long stride and purposeful.  I looked as natural for the creature to be walking upright as it had when the creature was running on all fours.  She described the creature as being very massively huge.  It was dark brown she thought, but couldn\u0092t tell for sure due to the dim lighting.This picture shows the power substation where the deer took refuge under a light.  This is to the north of the witnesses home.This picture shows the north half of the cemetery.This picture shows the south half of the cemetery and the guardrail from the highway that the creature stepped over.This area has a great many reports of sightings. Report #22475 , Report #24231, Report #23687, Report #24772 are a few that I have investigated.  There are more.   I myself had an encounter about three miles to the NW of Morton. ",
