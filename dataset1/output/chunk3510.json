Nonetheless, I am reporting this incident because even though I am skeptical, it remains possible that I did observe something extraordinary and if that is so then perhaps others did or will. So I offer this report as a possible sighting and to hopefully corroborate any other reports that you may receive involving the same area. Any such additional reports would of course then lend more credence to mine.",

It is possible that he saw a person or a bear.It was also explained why its very possible he saw a sasquatch.     This report is listed to allow for anyone else who may have further information to compare notes and contact the BFRO.",
