            "Observed": "I was born and raised on the bayou and would crab and fish with my family along the river, the local people would call this area fisher rider road which was along the mouth of the gulf of Mexico. My family and I was living in the town called Lake Charles which was across from West lake that was a industrial area Which led into small towns that was heavily wooded. It was the middle of September A muggy type of day. We lived in a place called Booker T. Washington courts. My mother, sister and I was waiting for my father to return from work late one afternoon. After a couple of hours we became concern I remember my mother being worried. By that time it turned dark and I remembered my mother said that it was 9pm. Finally my father walks thru the door but not empty handed. My father was a avid fisherman and thought that he would surprise his girls with fresh fish. I remembered the wonderful smell that came from that kitchen that night. It got hot so my mother opened the back door. That is when my sister and I had a chance to play, You see we would take turns pushing each other so that we could taking a ride on the screen door.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to KB for over an hour on the phone and she had these details to add--When KB was five years old, her and her younger sister were playing near the back screen door at about 9pm in the evening when she saw a  7 1/2 foot tall, bipedal creature  walk out of the woods. She described its gait as being very smooth, and fluid-like, unlike how a human would walk, but more as if it were skiing.-It approached a row of community garbage cans behind her house and ripped open the first can, bending the metal lid, and began 'savagely' digging through the garbage, strewing it about in a ten foot radius.-KB was only 50 feet from the creature and she could see it clearly because it was directly under a street light. She described it as being covered in reddish, or orangey-rust colored hair and that the street light seemed to give the tips of its hair a silvery sheen.-The creature was approx 350lbs, had a barrel chest, slim hips and that it was remarkably muscular. KB stated that its arms and legs were longer than a human's and that its hands were long. She added that it did not have to bend at the waist in order to reach the bottom of the garbage can.-When asked to compare it to the Patterson Creature, KB remarked that this creature seemed 'more fit', less bulky and that its muscles seemed to 'pop out' from beneath its 'well-groomed' hair. She also stated that although it kept its face averted and that she didn't get a good look at it, she stated that its head was pointed at the top and that she got the overall impression that it was a young male.-Although the sighting lasted well over 20 minutes, and KB was sure that the creature was aware of her, it didn't act intimidated by her and her sister's presence. It only seemed interested in getting to whatever was in the bottom of the can, which KB speculates was fish and crab remains.-When asked if she smelled anything, KB responded that she could not smell anything over the odor of the fish her mother was cooking at the time.-Being that KB was only five years old at the time, all she could liken the creature to was the cartoon spokes-animal, 'Tony the Tiger' because of its muscular build and orangish color. When she finally called to her mother and exclaimed 'Mommy, Tony the Tiger is digging in the trash can\", her mother looked out, saw the creature and slammed the door shut. -KB never saw the creature after that. Her younger sister did not remember the incident, and her mother has maintained all of these years that it was just a 'tall dog' rooting through the garbage.-At the time of the incident, their house backed up to the woods and the area was riddled with woods and abandoned industrial areas. Most of the people in her neighborhood fished and the scraps would always go into the garbage cans.I found KB to be forthright and sincere and although the incident happened over 15 years ago, her recollection of it was remarkably vivid.",
