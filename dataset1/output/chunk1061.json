I left my home in Manhattan Beach, California about 8:00 AM on the morning of February 16th after one last unsuccessful attempt to persuade my son to join me for a long weekend of wild pig hunting.  Monday was President\u0092s Day, my son was off school, and the Fort was open for hunting.  But 16-year old boys have other interests.  I arrived at the Fort about 12:30 PM alone, checked into Training Area 10/13 to hunt, and stopped at the Hacienda for lunch and to claim my room for the weekend.  After changing to camouflage clothing and hunting boots I headed up Sulfur Springs Road to where Training Area 10/13 begins.",

After the Wallace story hit the media in December 2002 he decided to come forward about his own sighting, to help counter the pervasive misinformation in the media about this subject.Various members of the BFRO spoke with him after the report was submitted. He is as credible as they come.",
