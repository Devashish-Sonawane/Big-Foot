The area of the encounters is old family land, and family stories of sightings, vocalizations, footprints, odors, tree/limb breaks, and suspected nest structures go back many years.  The witness takes a hike through the area for several hours almost every week, usually with her kids or a friend and a ritual is to leave Tootsie Rolls in the same location.  (While the candy is always gone by the next visit, the BF has not been actually observed picking the gifts up - I mention it only in light of all the other activity that is reported.)       According to the family, few signs of activity are often found during the hikes.  I've been invited for an on-site visit, and will be talking to other family members as well.",
