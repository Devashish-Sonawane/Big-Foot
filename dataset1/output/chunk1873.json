            "Follow-Up Report": "(Update, 10/30/2008) Public feedback about these sounds is pointing us in the direction of at least some of these calls being atypical cattle calls. On further discussion with the witness, he has noted that one farmer in the area does indeed have cattle, but that at the time these were recorded those cattle were not in this area.  However, as we cannot rule out a loose bull or cow, we decided to note that here and let the listener decide for themselves.Andy P.____________________________________I interviewed the witness by phone. I think he's credible and I have the following to add to his report.- The area is adjacent to a very wild portion of MN. There are some farms, but lots of woodlands and swamps.- The witnesses go to this area regularly, using knocks and their own voices to make whoop sounds to try to get a response.- These sounds were recorded along a two-mile stretch of road.  - The witnesses say the animal(s) were moving eastward during this extended auditory observation.  - At one point during the incident the animals seemed to cover more than a half mile in about a minute, crossing a stream, rough land, a barbed-wire fence, and a road, in about one minute.- The auditory observation lasted until the animals moved far off in the distance heading southeast, with sounds fading as they left.- The witnesses submitted seven sound files with this report. We cropped those files to just the best, most audible parts.  We also amplified the sounds so that they could be heard better (this was necessary due to the nature of the digital camera microphone and the way it picks up distant sounds). ________________________________________[Editor's Note (MM)]: These sounds provided below could have only come from: 1) humans making very uncharacteristic sounds or  2) sasquatches making characteristic sounds, or 3) free ranging cattle (cows that are not fenced in) making very uncharacteristic sounds.Certain sound characteristics in the beginning of the first clip sound like restless cattle, but soon the sound makers seem distinctly more primate-like than cow-like.With a careful listen to these recordings one can agree that the only rational option is primate, namely humans or sasquatches. The witness claims that similar sounds have been heard on previous visits to this same wild area. That means that a random third-party prankster/hoaxer scenario is very unlikely. Consequently, if the recordings are fake ...  then our witness is necessarily one of the fakers. By the same token, if the witness did not fake the recordings, then the recordings are most likely legitimate recordings of some primates that live out in this wild area. BFRO Investigator Andy P. has conversed with the witness and believes he is credible. Here are the recordings.
