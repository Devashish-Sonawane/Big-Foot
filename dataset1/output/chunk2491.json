            "Also Noticed": "I checked the area where I observed the things the following morning and found areas fo mashed grass and trails that roughly followed the sounds I had heard the previous night. What was unusual was that I got the impression that there was a young animal of some kind hurt. It was a mewling sound that was kind of scared that I heard in the area of the second thing. I did not find any footprints that could be identified. I did find depressions in the grass and trails through the still wet grass where something had moved. I also was surprised that the things seemed to communicate with each other. One of the things that was not seen seemed to be angry or upset about something. Also the things that did not cross the road but stayed in or around the creek seemed to be looking for something. They even went so far as to climb or attempt to climb a tree. My wife and I noticed a tree by the creek moving and swaying as if someone were climbing it. There was not enough wind to move the tree. There was also a strong musty odor when the breeze changed and blew in our direction.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On August 8, 2002, a friend and I met with this witness and his wife around 8:00 p.m. The location is about 45 minutes from where I live and is relatively remote. We drove to the mobile home where he witnessed the creatures. A few additions: This mobile home is one that he is renting to a couple. They have not been taking care of it, so the witness has been trying to evict them for some time. Every time he went to speak to them, they were gone. On the evening of August 1, the witness was working late on his computer. He decided to drive down to the mobile home around 3 a.m. to see if he could catch them there. He also needed to let his dogs out. They stayed at that mobile home because it had a pen outside and the renters fed them and moved them inside at night. His wife, who got up around this time to go to work at a local hospital, decided to go with him in case the tenants were there. As they pulled into the property and swung the car around, the headlights hit this creature on the edge of a tobacco field adjacent to the trailer. The witness just saw a flash of it and it didn't really register to him until he tried to let the dogs out. He then noticed movement in the field. When he first saw it, he says it was hunched over like it was trying to hide. Even hunched over, the creature was taller than the tobacco plants it was next to and they were around six feet tall. He then watched this creature move into the field slightly and make a very bizarre noise. He then heard another sound from the other side of the field but it was a different pitch. He then heard yet another one left of his position across the road near the creek. This man has hunted all his life all across the country and he stated that he has never heard anything like these vocalizations before. He is sure they were communicating with one another. He then got a real uneasy feeling that he was intruding. He felt that the larger creature was positioning itself between him and the ones across the field in a defensive posture. Not knowing what he was dealing with, he got his wife out of the mobile home, put the dogs inside, and left. As they were making their way to the car, they noticed a tree across the road by a creek shaking violently. Now I personally have never seen or heard one, but as the three of us were standing there at the edge of the field talking, we heard a VERY odd scream/growl from way up on the mountain across from us. I must say it was unlike anything I've ever heard before. This area is in a valley between two large mountain ranges and it was getting pretty dark and the sound appeared to be pretty far off. The witness also showed us depressions that he found everywhere. There is a large round bale of hay directly across from the porch about 75 feet from the mobile home. There were two large impressions in the deep grass on the field side of the bale. They were approximately 3 1/2 feet across. It appeared to us that something large had been standing there watching the mobile home. We could also see where the creature had made a beeline through the tobacco and toward the direction of the other sounds the witness heard. He also pointed out the tree across the road near the creek that was shaking violently as if something was trying to climb it. The witness also noticed that it was unusually quiet of insects such as crickets during the whole experience... just the neighbors\u0092 dogs barking. I feel this couple is highly credible and they seem to really believe they witnessed something out of the ordinary. They are both professionals and are active in their community. We will be spending the night on the porch at the mobile home in the next couple of weeks. More reports to follow.",
