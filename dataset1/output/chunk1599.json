Some information he added:The overall body reminded him of a gorilla -- very large and muscular with an estimated 1,000lb weight.  No neck.  Shoulder width estimated at 4'.The first time he tried to wake his son, his son didn't respond.  A few minutes later he tried again. His son acknowledged his request to turn on the cargo light that shines over the bed of the truck.   When the light came on the figure walked behind a tree ( he estimated the tree was about 3 ft. wide).  Shortly thereafter it left from behind the tree and he could no longer see it. He did not hear it walking away.  The overall observation lasted about 10 minutes. At the closest point it was about 20' away.  ",

It went to a curve to the right and then back to a curve to the left.  I made the first curve and when I was coming aroung the other curve I saw this huge beast just step over a six strand barbed wire fence. I slammed on my brake and then just took off. I was scared to death.  This was no man and damn sure not a bear.It had to be at least 8 to 8 1/2 feet tall and weight no less than 500.bs. I weigh 230lbs and it was at least twice my size! It's hair was a really dark brown and not as long as I thought it would be. It looked to be covered with 6 to 8 inch hair. It's chest and abdomen didn't seem to be as hairy and I could see it's eyes, nose, and mouth, so I assume they were not hairy either.  As I've said before when I made the curve it was stepping over a 4' fence like it was nothing.  It saw me and didn't run, but just turned it's head and continued to walk down the fence line.  I should have taken a longer look, but I was really freaking out at this point so I just drove on into Atlanta.",
