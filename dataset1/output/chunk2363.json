Earlier in the evening after setting up camp, around 5:30pm he did a couple wood knocks.  They spent the evening at camp watching deer.  The screams woke him and his friend up from a sound sleep about 2:30am. He is unsure of how many vocalizations he heard but there were several over a 4 to 5 minute period.  The sounds came from perhaps 40 yards away followed by the snap of a limb.After searching for vocalizations he found the attached multimedia link, number 8 in the series of recordings with the pictured gorilla was close to what he heard.He plans to return with night vision and recording devices in the spring.",

When I looked I seen its face, it was one of the scariest things I had ever seen, but at the same moment it was interesting. As soon as it looked at me it then walked off. I ran as fast as I could back home. But I do not even remember my feet touching the ground.",
