            "Observed": "I went out to custer state park after the buffalo roundup to just rest and ride my horse....I rode all day friday. I came back to camp ,fed and watered my horse, I was the only one in camp. I went to town to eat as I was tired and did not feel like cooking. I went to Custer, had a burger and left for camp. As you pass BLUE BELL loge you take a dirt road about 3 miles to camp, at the 2.5 sign you go up a good size hill, just as I came to the top of the hill, to my left I saw something coming down the hill. It hit the road and took one long step and was down the hill on my right. There was a lot of dust and rocks that came down with it, but I saw it very good. It was 6 to 7 ft tall, it had brown and red hair all over, looked like a gorilla only more manlike. It was not a buffalo or a deer or elk or bear. I went back to camp fast, put the horse in the trailer and went home. I did not say anything to anyone, as they think I am nuts anyway. I know what I saw was not a man in a suit .",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness considers himself to be a cowboy. He works with leather, makes saddles and other tack professionally, and he has participated several times in the yearly buffalo round-up (on horseback) in Custer State Park. He is an avid hunter. When I asked if it could have been a bear he\u0092d seen he said, \u0093No. I\u0092ve actually raised a bear\u0085 It was no bear.\u0094 The creature he saw came down a steep embankment on the left side of the road, landed, not on its feet, on the road just 10 to 15 yards in front of his truck. It was 9:00 PM, dark, but he could see it well in his headlights. It picked itself up and \u0093in one step\u0094 was off the road, and headed down the very steep and high slope on the right side. It was so steep there, he said, that a person would have trouble going down it in daylight. A person wouldn\u0092t really even try it, he said. The witness said the creature was tall, had long legs, a thick build, and was covered with hair. It did not turn and look at him when it crossed the road. \u0093I know what I saw\u0094 the witness repeated two or three times to me. \u0093No way it was a man \u0096 too big,\u0094 he said. He wasn\u0092t interested in bigfoot at all. He\u0092d heard of it, of course \u0096 \u0093Yeah, I\u0092ve heard of bigfoot, Loch Ness\u0085 monsters, all that\u0085 but I didn\u0092t really care about any of that,\" and he doesn\u0092t really care about it now. But now he\u0092s afraid of being out in the dark, and of what he saw; the idea of it mostly. He left the round-up right after his sighting, even though he planned to stay another day or two. It really upset him. It has changed his life. He just doesn\u0092t want to go out into the wild anymore. He didn\u0092t tell the others at the round-up about his sighting because he has a reputation with them as a practical joker \u0096 it wasn\u0092t worth telling them. He just wanted to leave.This man was completely believable to me. He has no doubt that what he saw was not a man or a bear. He told me he can\u0092t quite believe what he saw. ",
