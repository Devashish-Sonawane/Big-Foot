Later, one witness remained in the tent, and the other tried to duplicate the sound of the footsteps outside, but could not. They estimate the rock was thrown from about 6 feet away. The campsite area is large and remote, with no other campers nearby.  Lake Jeannette is surrounded by very rocky ground and is in the Superior National Forest, close to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. ",
