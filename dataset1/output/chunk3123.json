It was right at dusk when I looked out into the graveyard to a far point over looking the WV Turnpike. I saw this large creature moving about the tombstones as if to be pacing back and fourth. It would stop sometimes as if to dig at a grave. It was very large, dark hairy appearance, ape like movements, shrugging of the shoulders and sometimes a hop to its step. It finally saw me and seemed to get upset when it started its shoulder movements and hopping motions, and it seemed to start toward me as if to run me away.",
