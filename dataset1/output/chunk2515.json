There is not a lot to add that he has not already addressed in his narrative. The witnesses report stands well on its own.The witness provided the attached sketches that accompany this report.I did some searching on Google Maps, with the terrain feature turned-on. As near as I could determine, this witness was likely on or near what is now USFS Rd 62, or a trail nearby. There was only one place that I found that matched his description.Because of the details provided, the very remote location, and the description of the creatures he observed, I believe that this witness observed a family of sasquatch that never expected to see a human in this place.",
