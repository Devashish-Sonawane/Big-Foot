            "Follow-Up Report": "I sent M.C. my phone number and e-mail address, and on the evening of April 22, 2002 he got back to me by phone and related the following information about his sighting that took place twenty years ago.M.C. estimated it was walking down the trail/road about 200 yards away when he and his friend entered the same trail/road.  It never looked back at them, and continued walking quickly, almost at a trot, until it disappeared around a curve in the trail/road, or into the forest.  M.C. believes the creature never knew that it was being observed while they were all walking down that same trail/road.Their first reaction was that it was a large naked person with football shoulder pads on, and they both thought it was kind of humorous.  After looking at it a little longer, it seemed to have a furry wet suit or coat on, with a hood, which was light brown in color, something like cherry wood.  M.C. thought it was over six feet tall and weighed around three hundred pounds. They never got close enough to see its face, and never noticed any ears on its head.  The total time that they observed it was about one minute, and at that time they never smelled or heard anything strange.  Their trail back to camp intersected this trail/road before they came to where he or it was walking, and they never saw any tracks in the trail that it might have made.  At that time they had no fear of it, because they never gave it a second thought about it being a bigfoot/sasquatch. They attempted to tell other people about what they had seen, but were laughed at and were told it was probably a bear or something.  But M.C. and his friend knew that bears don\u2019t walk like people for that distance, and at that speed; plus it never went down on all fours like a bear would do.  Only later did they come to the realization that it had to be a bigfoot/sasquatch.After talking with M.C., I believe that he and his friend observed a sasquatch/bigfoot on that hot afternoon in August, in the Lassen National forest.

That's when everything changed and my energy level went way up. It was off to the side of the old road or trail I was on. Looked like it probably been made after the water covering the road at one time had receded. I circled the track, going farther out each time looking for more. I got my camera and a measuring tape. It measured about 14\" long and 6\" wide and was probably about a week or two old. About 1 inch deep.  Still holding its shape I could make out the outline of four toes. As I was measuring and taking photos I found myself looking over my shoulder every couple of minutes.",
