            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with this witness in mid January of 2017 and worked with him one-on-one to create a witness sketch of the individual that he saw that July day. The witness has raised cattle and exotics, is a lifelong hunter, is highly educated, in the medical profession, and I found him to be 100% credible.Additional details that can be added: Hair: Dark brown with bleached out tips that turned strawberry blond towards the ends. From chest level down the hair became matted in lengths of 4 to 6 inches long. He described them like bundles of hair that tapered at the top and at the ends, increasing in numbers on the lower portion of the body.Shoulders were approximately 3.5 feet wide. No neck was seen. Nor were hands and feet seen.Arms: Massive biceps and forearms, and looked very long.Height: Individual was approximate 5.5 feet tall ON ALL FOURS.Weight: 850lbs to 1000lbs due to muscle massHead: Conical ShapedThe witness was astounded by the speed demonstrated by this creature. He isn't sure exactly what direction it went. It was there one second, and gone when he looked back. He also did not hear any sounds from the creature after he got out of his truck to look around for it.The Canadian River Valley is 906 miles long. It consists of flat terrain, bluffs, ravines, pockets of thick trees in some areas, and numerous plum thickets. Water sources include the Canadian River, numerous streams, stock tanks, even fresh water frac ponds throughout the area. Food sources: Deer, Turkey, Hogs, Antelope, Rabbits, various types of small animals, and wild sand Plums.Bluffs in this area can range 100 feet or more, and could possible be used for protection and safe travel corridors.Witness' sketch:",
