Back then it was a relatively new subdivision and our home backed up to a wooded area.  My sighting was in the middle of the day.  I was walking my dog, Charlie in the backyard and all of a sudden she stopped.  I looked around and took note of the fence line right where she was looking and growling.  It was straight in front of us.  The bigfoot was about 50 feet in front of me on the other side of the fence line.  We starred at each other for a few minutes.  I had such a hold on Charlie's leash.  After a few minutes of looking at one another, he turned an ran away.  As soon as he turned, I turned, grabbed the dog and made a run for the house. I looked back just as I was almost in the house and he was gone.",
