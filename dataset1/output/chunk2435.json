            "Observed": "It was dusk and I was walking one of my sister's dogs. It had been raining but wasn't at the time we were walking. We rounded a corner & saw a figure on the road in front of us crossing the road - maybe about 200 feet away. It was about 5 feet tall (I'm 6 ft. tall & it was a good bit shorter than me). It was on 2 feet, had dark hair all over its body. The arms seemed very long. I could not see the face clearly - it did turn towards us.  The arms moved as it walked. I saw it step on the road then across a small ditch & low bank in one stride. It went off into the woods. The dog stood very still & rigid as we watched this figure. He never barked (which was amazing because he barks at everything!). Once the figure disappeared, he wanted to go after it, but of course I turned him around & we walked back to my sister's house.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After conversing with the witness the following points can be added to her report:-The bi-pedal figure was already in the road walking from the first moment she saw it.-Its arms were in motion, swinging as it walked, and this prevented her from getting a clear estimate of their length in relationship to the knees, but she had a clear sense that they were longer than normal.-At her distance she couldn't estimate the hair length, but she could tell that it covered the entire body. She is a tall person herself and she knew for sure that the hairy figure was shorter than her.  If this was a sasquatch it was most likely a young one.-As she watched, it exited to the right side of the road and walked into the woods, uphill and away from the valley bottom.-The witness estimates a full minute transpired from the time she first first noticed the figure to the point it disappeared into the trees.This sighting took place in the least populated county of Virginia. The BFRO is actively following up other reports from this area and has studied vocalizations captured in the mountains of the nearby George Washington National Forest. Reports originating along the Virginia/West Virginia border area are not uncommon and reports submitted from this area will most likely increase.",
