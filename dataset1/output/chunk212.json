            "Observed": "My nephew and I were out bowhunting for deer in the early season. The area I hunt in is 2 or  mile hike from behind our ranch. We went out late in the day to catch the deer bedding down. we set up in front of a well used deer trail. W waited for some deer to come nto our shooting lane for around 2 hours, but nothing happened. After 3 hours it was getting dark, but i was very determined that day. i happened to glance up on the hill above me, which is 500 yards to the top, and i saw a tall black somthing walking around, but i didnt pay any attention to it, i figured it was my eyes playing tricks on me. Soon after that somthing didnt seem right about the where i was at, i felt like i was being watched, my nephew told me he did to, so we headed home, which was a 2 or 3 mile hike downhill. We were probably only 3/4 of a mile away form home when we heard a big crash in the brush behind us, i never run from anything, but i ran from that crash, whatever it was. and as we ran, we could here somthing running behind us, i didnt look back, i just ran faster. this thing chased us for at least 1/2 a mile. when we saw the gate to the pasture, we jumped it,cleared it. we ran a little further and than stopped and turned around. what i saw still gives me goosebumps. standing behind he gate was a massive creature, 6 1/2 to 7 feet tall. icould see it was hairy form the backround of the sky, but it was too dark to see any facial details. When i saw it, my shoulder blades and spine tingled, this tngle went al the way down to my feet, and i could not move a muscle. The creature and i studied each toher for at least 30 seconds, maybe shorter,maybe longer. it did look massive and broad,but it still was to dark to make out a lot of detail. After 30 seconds, it just tunred around and walked off on to legs. the shoulders were indeed broad, i could make that out when it walked out from under the tree it was under . it walked like a human,not a bent walk. about that time i came to my senses,my nephew came to his, and we ran all the way back to the house.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness, the following details can be added to this report:- When the witness first saw the animal on the hill above him, it was several hundred yards away, and because of the coloring, the thought of bigfoot did go through his mind.- The initial big crash that the boys heard was that of brush snapping.- The witness was able to determine the height range because the creature was standing next to fence posts that are 6 feet tall.- Once beyond the fence, the boys turned to see what was chasing them.  What they saw was black in color with a body that was bulky and broad, giving the impression of a mature male.  The creature had a neck.- The witness feels that being chased was part of a territorial display by the creature.Other stories:- In late evening, in 2001, the witness was out taking care of his dog in their kennel, when he heard what sounded like a low pitched woman's voice.  The voice was making mumbling noises that sounded like syllables being strung together.  The voice was emanating from a forested area about 150 feet away.- When the witness was 7 or 8 years old, he heard what sounded like very loud laughing combined with the bleating of a goat.  A very strange sound.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. He is credible and knowledgeable. The incidents happened in a part of the Apalachicola National Forest where few people ever venture. He hunts there each year because the area is so loaded with wildlife.His description of the nests among the palmettos is particularly interesting and potentially useful. The palmetto palm fronds were not large and fully grown. They were young and relatively small but not tiny. They were all broken off where the fan part meets the stem.  They were also all green when the nest was found, indicating that it was assembled not long before it was found.  The palm fans were clearly broken off by hand, not sawed off. They were not collected from the palmettos immediately surrounding the nest.  They were gathered elsewhere and carried to the spot then laid out on the ground to create a ground cover. As mentioned in the report, his brother found another one of these nests in the same general area of the Ochlockonee River bottom some time later.The witness mentioned that most people do not venture into dense palmetto groves because they tend to harbor rattlesnakes. I've been in these environments in Florida many times and I do not venture into thick palmetto groves for that reason precisely.There was no indication that any humans had ever ventured into the area where the nest was found.  When a homeless person makes a camp in brush there is ALWAYS litter around the area. Nothing like that was anywhere near the area. The area is among the most pristine in northern Florida.",
