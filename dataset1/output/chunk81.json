They were on their way home from Ocean City, WA. She was looking into a clear cut area and suddenly a large creature stood up erect from a \"squatting\" position. It was over 6 feet tall at best guess. It was the same grayish black hue as the stumps and tree piles around it. She said it had a very flat face. No snout at all so she is positive it was not a bear. Her boyfriend didn't see it as he was driving. They didn't stop. She could not have gone into the clear cut to investigate as she is disabled. Summary:With the number of sightings from the Grays Harbor county area, I'm inclined to believe she saw a creature that was not a bear. ",
