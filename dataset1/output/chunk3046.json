            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness about what she heard that day. She described the calls as lasting approximately 5 seconds long and it was repeated several times over the course of a minute or so. She said they camped in the area for about 4 days and never heard the howls again. The witness said she later checked her Cornell Ornithology app, but was not able to locate anything remotely similar.  She told me that she often identifies birds by sound. She also told me that the sound was unlike any elk, moose or other large animal she had ever heard. She told me it sounded similar to an old crank police or air raid siren.  I asked the witness about her experience with the outdoors. She described living in a rural area and in addition to the St. Joe National Forest they frequently bike and camp around Moscow Mountain in Latah County.I asked the witness how she came to discover the Ohio Howl on the BFRO site. She said she was talking to a friend who's husband was an avid Bigfoot enthusiast and was encouraged to check the BFRO site. The witness said the Ohio Howl was exactly the type of howl she heard.It should be noted that up the mountain northwest of the witnesses camping site is a power line which runs from the Dworshak Dam to Montana though very rugged terrain. It has long been suspected that Bigfoot frequently use power line routes to travel. I found the witness to be very articulate and sincere. I believe she heard an \"Ohio Howl\" which was likely a Bigfoot vocalizing.  ",
