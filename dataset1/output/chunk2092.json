When he got close to the two-track road he could see the opening up ahead and seen the animal cross the 8 - 10 ft wide road with one step.  While standing where the animal crossed, he saw the head looking from behind a tree.  He did see some facial detail, as it was only about 30 ft away.  It looked similar to a gorilla, more so than human or bear.  They watched each other for a couple of minutes before the animal turned and quickly disappeared.    The witness said he has never seen anything so big in his life and never believed in bigfoot before the experience.  He could not believe that something so big could move so fast without making any noise at all.  He hasn't been back to the area since.       ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to Curtis V over the phone and found him to be sincere, forthright and very knowledgeable about Florida ecology and wildlife. After leaving his hunt camp at approximately 1130am, Curtis was driving down an unpaved forest road in the Ocala National Forest when he saw an upright figure walk out of the woods 150 yards in front of his vehicle on the left hand side of the road. Curtis immediately slammed on the brakes and watched as the figure stepped onto the road, turned at the waist to look directly at him, then it turned the rest of the way around and walked back into the woods. The entire encounter lasted about 3-5 seconds. His description of the figure was:-Dark-brown and covered with hair-Over seven feet tall-Weighed over 300lbs-The head was large and sat directly on the shoulders-There was no visible neck-The shoulders were broader than a man\u0092s shoulders-The arms were longer than a man\u0092s arms and very muscular-The legs were very muscular and it stood upright the entire timeCurtis stated that he could not make out any facial detail because of the distance. He could not see individual fingers but that the hands appeared to look human. After the figure disappeared from view Curtis stated that he initially did not move forward. He knew immediately that what he had seen was a Bigfoot, not a bear, and did not know what to expect if he did drive forward. When he finally did drive up to the spot that he had seen it walk into the woods, Curtis decided that he did not feel safe exiting his vehicle. He did take note of the terrain it walked into and said that it was \u0091very thick, too thick to walk through without bulldozing your way in\u0092.This sighting took place in the Ocala National Forest, which consists of over 600 square miles of pristine wilderness and near the 74-mile long Ocklawaha River. It is also very close to a 2007 Class B vocalization near Fort McCoy, report #29371 , as well as a 1977 sighting by a Baptist Minister, report #728.  ",
