            "Follow-Up Report": "After a follow up interview, the witness had the following to add to his report:The witness was approximately half way across the river fishing when he noticed it. He was within 30 feet of it and described it as tall and lean; not broad as other witnesses have reported. Its hair was several inches longer than a bear's and greyish-brown in color. He said the cheeks, eyes and palms of its hands were bare and the skin was the same color as its hair. The arms were longer than a person's arms would be even at seven feet in height.  His brother-in-law observed the animal as well, but further down the river. When the animal left, it turned and walked up the side of the mountain effortlessly and hid itself in a thicket of laurels and rhododendren. The terrain in that area is steep and rocky. The population is still as sparse today as it was when the men had their sighting. The witness owns and operates a roofing company out of Asheville, NC and is very familiar with the various wildlife in the Carolina mountains. ",
