Take the trail all the way up the hill...roughly 1 to 2 miles in...you will round a corner by an open area and enter a heavily wooded area...from this spot on, I always feel watched and like someone is there.",

            "Observed": "We were mountain biking through \"Lost Nation\", state land that is open to most outdoor activity. The land is hilly and fairly heavily wooded, has a river run through it, and covers a large expanse of land, so there are many remote areas inaccessible to most casual adventurers.  We were riding up the hill leading into the deeper part of the trail, when we stopped to rest, just as we stopped we heard a deep growling kind of sound that was so loud, you could kind of feel it even though the sound came from a good distance away. My friend and I were at a loss to be able to explain the sound...it was as if something was letting us know it was there...but we never saw anything. After a couple of minutes, the loud \"growl\" was heard again...just about as close as the first time. My buddy and I just joked it off as being \"bigfoot\", but I have lived near that area almost all my life, and I heard stories of people seeing something strange out there since I was a small kid...I am now 38 years old.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.  On questioning, the witness  described it as a very low frequency sound that could be \"felt\" as well as heard.  He likened it to the sub-woofers that a lot of kids have in their cars, the ones you can hear/sense well before you ever hear the vehicle itself.  The nature of the sound was similar to a chainsaw, except at the much lower pitch described.",
