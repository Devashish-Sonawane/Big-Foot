            "Observed": "My roommate and I were smoking on my back porch about 9 p.m. I live in Fannin County on Bear Creek, a feeder to the N. Sulphur, out of no where, we start hearing hollering down in the creek. Loud howling!! Only it sounded as if a very large Curly of \"three stooges\", yelling whoooooop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. Absolutely clear as day and so loud!! For like 15-20 min. Up and down the creek, almost no diminished sound though. It sounded, for the life of me, like a mother calling a child back home. Never heard it before.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness at her home. In addition to the observation on this report, she reported seeing a bigfoot on October 28, 2015, at 4 pm, walk across her property into a thicket. She saw it from her porch approximately 100 yards away. She saw it from behind and did not see its face. She described it as having flowing, shiny black hair and about as tall as I can reach (8 feet), when we replicated the sighting. She said its butt looked about 4 feet wide. Later that night, she heard and recorded growl-like vocals and saw a single tree, 50 feet tall and 3 feet in diameter, waving back and forth with little wind and no other trees moving.On other occasions she said that she had heard howling similar to wolf howls she heard on YouTube and sometimes mixed with coyote calls but much louder. She also reported that rocks were sometimes thrown at her house. She had several dogs on the property and reported that her St Bernard was always frightened when the bigfoot was around.She and I did a search of her property. The habitat included thick woods that extended to a creek bottom. I did not find any tracks or other bigfoot evidence but did find some very large canine tracks which undoubtedly came from the St. Bernard. This animal had been a stray and may explain some suspected wolf tracks reported by other witnesses in this part of north Texas. The witness said she often sees deer, hogs, and other small game on or near her property. I also found an abundance of mudbugs (crayfish) and many nearby gardens and field crops as potential food sources. This property is located between Cooper Lake and Coffee Mill Lake, both sites of several North Texas reports.I found the witness to be very sincere about her experiences and credible in her description of events.",
