            "Observed": "I was in Pope county Illinois researching cougars. I arrived at camp on a Wednesday and happened to be the only camper in the area. It was near sundown when I arrived so I was cutting wood through out the night. I can recall breaking limbs around midnight when to my surprise I began hearing wood knocks coming from the near by canyon. These knocks were aggressive and LOUD. There was no wind either.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone, and later met him in person. I found him to be sincere and credible.He arrived late at the campground, and unknowingly provoked the wood knocks by breaking and chopping firewood.  Answering knocks were returned in a pattern of five knocks, followed by a period of silence, and then four to five more knocks. A set of  foot prints (8) was found along the same creek the following spring. They measured fourteen inches in length. He now searches for evidence of both cougars and sasquatches.----[Editor's Note: Matt Pruitt]Wood knock reports are significant to the BFRO, in that they describe a behavior that no indigenous animals other than sasquatches engage in. Although the witness didn't see the animal that made the sounds, the only animals that are even capable of making such sounds are sasquatches, and humans. Due to the circumstances of the report (the remote location, the inaccessibility of the dense area that the knocks came from, and the time at which they occurred), it is highly likely that the sounds were generated by one or more sasquatches in the area, and not by other humans.Many BFRO members have experienced this behavior in several different places on the continent. The context of the behavior usually indicates that the sasquatches are coordinating their movements, and subtly keeping each other aware of their respective locations. This behavior was most likely developed for hunting and surrounding prey, but is sometimes utilized when sasquatches are approaching humans, presumably to observe them. Occasionally, they will make very loud knocks to intimidate human intruders. It is uncertain why this particular animal was knocking loudly, but it could be assumed that it was related to the witness loudly chopping and breaking branches periodically throughout the evening.",
