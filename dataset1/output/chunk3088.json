During the early 90\u0092s, I wanted to live like Grizzly Adams, and I moved to a remote wilderness in Northern Idaho.  To give an idea of how remote of an area this was, the forest service road just past our place was gated off to protect grizzly bears.  Only a handful of people lived in this area, spread out over a dozen twenty-forty acre properties.  Everything else was just extreme wilderness.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness telephonically and found his story to be credible.  Some additional information gleaned during the interview is listed below.- Of the night of his sighting, the witness said, \u0093Bigfoot was the furthest thing from my mind that night.\u0094  He had heard of bigfoot before this event but had never given the subject any serious thought.- There were half a dozen families that lived in the area at that time.  They sometimes got together for special occasions.  On the night of this sighting they were celebrating Halloween.  One neighbor brought a tractor and a large trailer for the purpose of giving everyone a \u0093hay ride.\u0094- In spite of it being late October, the weather was warm and clear. The moon was full, or almost full, on that night and the visibility was excellent.- The witness says that upon seeing this figure he immediately knew it wasn\u0092t any kind of animal he\u0092d ever seen before. He said, \u0093I Immediately got confused by what I saw.  I was speechless.\u0094  He says he was so close to the figure that the creature could have reached out and touched him.  He estimated the distance between them was less than six feet.  He says he didn\u0092t feel threatened, but the very closeness of the encounter made him feel it would have been unsafe to do anything but keep quiet and keep walking.- As he walked past the creature he saw it rise up and walk away.  The creature made no noise.  It took three or four steps before going out of sight amongst the vegetation.- The witness says the entire encounter lasted about 10 seconds, but the bright moonlight and the close proximity gave him a very good look at the creature.  - In describing the appearance of the creature, the witness said it did not have the same appearance as the sasquatch seen in the Patterson/Gimlin film.  He indicated that the figure he saw looked very much like the images of Gigantopithecus shown on the BFRO website.- He says that in the moonlight the over-all color of the creature was a greyish-silvery color.  The hair seemed to be six to eight inches long.  It was very sparse on the face and he could see the facial skin was darker than the surrounding hair.  It had a flat nose.  He couldn\u0092t see any ears due to the hair covering the sides of the head.- He says he never saw the creature\u0092s feet.  The torso was broad.  He described the creature as having a lean (but not lanky) yet muscular build.  - The witness brought up two specific points that he found quite interesting.  The first is that the creature was totally silent.  Even when it stood up and walked away it made no noise.  The second point was that the creature never looked directly at him.  It seemed to keep its head turned just far enough away that it had to use its peripheral vision to watch the witness.- The witness is positive the creature he saw was not a human.  He said he chose not to discuss the event with anyone until many years later.I taught a Wilderness Survival class to search and rescue volunteers at Bloom Lake in May 2009.  The area certainly has the necessary requirements of food, water and shelter. ",
