A member of our party noticed someone moving around on a rock ledge up on the cliffs about 250-300 feet above the river. They were about 1/2 mile away from us. As we started watching, whatever it was started jumping around, waving its arms like it was trying to get our attention. It did get our attention. It was jumping around like it was playing. We were able to observe it for 5 to 10 minutes. It jumped from one rock ledge to another that was 15 feet away and 20 feet or so down. A person couldn't have made that jump. It then jumped into a gully and disappeared. We waited a long time to see if it would reappear, but it didn't.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on 9/06/02. The witness is an acquaintance of my family. He told this story to my brother after my brother told him that I was in a Bigfoot research group. The witness lives in the area of the sighting. The witness was out with his wife and friends, swimming and fishing from a sandbar in the Brazos River. It was a clear, hot, sunny day between 1 and 2 pm. This is at the north end of Lake Whitney where the Brazos flows into the lake. There are very high limestone cliffs in this area, going up from the river. They were just out having a good time when one person noticed what they first thought was another person up on a rock ledge on the cliffs. He got the other people to look and they watched as this figure was jumping around on the ledge, waving its arms. As they watched it, they noticed that it looked very large, and was covered with dark brown hair. It had the shape of a person, but was much larger. It was about 1/2 mile away from where they were located, at an elevation of 250-300 feet above the river. They watched as this animal jumped from one rock ledge to another one that was 15 away horizontally and 20 down. It then jumped down into a gulley and disappeared. At this point, they decided that it definitely wasn't a person. They it for 5-10 minutes. They got the impression that it was playing around, jumping and waving its arms, maybe even to get their attention. They definitely felt that it saw them. They waited around for awhile to see if it would re-appear, but it didn't. They hiked over to the area to see if there was any evidence. As the terrain was very rocky, they didn't find any tracks or other evidence. They did see a cedar tree that it had been standing next to at one point. This tree was taller than them and the creature was taller than the tree. They estimated its height to have been at least 8 feet. It did not make any sounds that they could hear, and they were too far away to detect any odors. They described it as being very tall, but not fat or bulky, even thin. It moved on two legs at all times, standing straight upright. Its arms hung down to knee level. The land is now fenced in and is Corps of Engineer property. There are many caves in the area. The witness has heard many strange noises at night in the area. The ones that defy identification are described as screams. There are tales from people in the area of something large and hairy that is seen sometimes crossing the roads late at night. The people in the area aren't really concerned about it as they don't really know what it is. TBRC Investigator\u00a9Copyright 1999-2002 Texas Bigfoot Research Center  ",
