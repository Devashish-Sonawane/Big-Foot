            "Follow-Up Report": "I e-mailed the reporting party several days ago, and he returned by phoning me on the evening of 10-7-04. We went over D.G.\u0092s report (he wants to remain anonymous), and he came across as a credible witness.  He said that he was in an area that not too many people would attempt to get into, because of the inaccessibility of the terrain.When he heard this most terrifying of screams, which he said, \u0093had to came from something very large, due to the volume of the scream, and it lasted several seconds.\u0094 This made this hunters hair stand up, all over his body, and it caused him to change his mind about hunting in this area on that day.  He then turned around and retreated from his perceived prime hunting grounds.    D.G. was a young man with a high-powered hunting rifle in his hands, in a remote and rugged area early one dark morning deer hunting. He thought that he was not afraid of anything, but this scream caused him to leave that area.  He is not sure that sasquatch creatures really exist in the first place, but if they do, he would leave them alone, because he doesn\u0092t want to have anything to do with them.  Our witness is still hunting this general area, and this past week end he observed numerous pinion pine trees that have their tops torn off, and he believes that the bears are doing this to get to the pinion nut that are growing on the top of those trees. D.G. said that the trees are 12\u0092 to 15\u0092 feet tall and the top 4 feet are broken off, and their diameters are about 4\u0094 inches thick.  He has also observed numerous prints, some have claws and some larger ones that don\u0092t have claws, just toes.  Many scat piles.  I have asked him to please take and send pictures next time out.

            "Observed": "I was hunting Elk with my Bro in Law. Up in Chalk Creek. That is in Summit County in Utah. We had been in this deep canyon for some time. It was getting dark, so we heeded out of it. I can still see this in my head,..We were climbing up out of a small draw onto a flat meadow. As we got to the top of it. We both saw something very black in color move into a small stand of pine trees. It let out a huge Whoooff sort of sound as it went in. Also it moved a pine bow that flipped from the ground to about five feet in the air. My Bro in law said \" What the Heck was that\"!!! As he put a shell into the chamber. This stand of pines was no bigger than a front yard. There was a clearing behind it. I have thought on this for some time. I think that we came in contact with it. And we surprised each other. The Creature was to our left, and we had a Beaver Dam to our right. The thing was about 30 feet away from us in the pines. We were on a Deer path between the pond and the pines. We backed up, and this thing let out a low gutteral growl at us. You could hear it's teeth chatter also. I have felt fear in my life, but a sense of evil came over me. On the way home we talked about what we had saw. We were so close to this thing. I know for a fact it was not a Bear or Moose. A Bear does not move that fast on it's hind legs. I used to work at Lagoon in Farmington. It's an amusement park. I used to feed the animals down there. They had a Leapord that would growl at you when you walked by it's cage. That growl was almost just like what I heard on that mountain. I have been in the hills all my life, and have never seen or heard anything like that. Pleas give me a call.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After interviewing this witness, the following can be added to his original statement. The witness has worked as a licensed hunting guide and a wildlife artist. When the incident occurred, it was still light enough to be considered shooting light.  They surprised the creature by walking with the wind in their face.  The animal could not see them because of the grade of the hill until the pair of hunters stepped into the clearing, whereupon the animal \"whoofed\" at them, moving a pine bough out of its way as it walked into the trees. They could not see the entire body of the creature, only from about 5 ft. off the ground, or from its hips on up.  Estimated height was about 9 ft. The witness is adamant that this was an animal moving upright, on two legs. They never saw the creature again, but then they heard it growl.  At the end of the growl it clicked its teeth together.  The witness said it reminded him of the way a cornered dog would growl at you, and how some dogs finish a growl by chattering their teeth together.The animal's coat looked like jet black hair, not fur. It scared them enough that they left. I found this witness to be credible and an experienced outdoorsman.This area is made up of several small, private ranches.  Like most large tracts of private property, there is an abundance of elk and deer.  The witness is willing to take me to the location next Spring.",
