When you tell people, most in not so many words call you a liar! Or I don't beleave that stuff! I'm sure a lot of you have experianced that. My first incident was a sighting, at night. My wife and kids and I were on county highway #21, headed back home to Babbitt from Virginia. On the curve just past the Wassa town hall road. The pasenger side high beam light had a broken mount. The light pointed to the oncomming traffic lane. As I was on the curve, I saw a very tall hairy creature walking accross the road. The bad headlight staid fixed on him as he crossed the road. I drive with one of my hands on top of the wheel, and this time it was my right hand. I pointed and tried to yell but nothing came out! Again I tried, still nothing! as it got into the ditch by a evergreen fall. I finnally was able to yell to my wife, \"did you see that!!\" She was playing a hand held yahtzee game. And she jumped in her seat when I yelled. I don't remember what she said, but I know she asked me what I saw. I told her I saw Bigfoot. She later told me, that she beleaved me. I can still see this in my mind clear as a bell. For a long time now I've had recurring dreams about it, some are nightmares.",
