I clocked out around 4:45 a.m., yes a.m. I was driving on Rochester Road getting close to the stoplight at Oak Hill Road when from the left side of the road a two legged creature ran across the road in front of me. It was still dark out and I had my lights on, the creature was just at the end of where my lights hit. It didn't seem to be extremely tall, but what caught my eye was the huge muscles on its legs and arms. It didn't appear to have much of a neck, like the head was sitting on the shoulders. I could see that it was not wearing any clothes, but also did not see long hair either. I would estimate it to be between 6'-6'5\". It was a dark dirty black/grey color. It disappeared quickly into the cornfield. This all runs extremely close to the river. The area it came from always has multiple deer feeding and crossing the road.  I always drive slow and cautiously on this stretch of road.",

            "Observed": "I was driving south on Batesville-Pike Rd on my way to work.  There are woods on both sides of this road with a tall chain link fence surrounding the woods on both sides.  The right hand side of the road is part of Camp Robinson.  Just past the fence there is a fire break before the tree line begins.  I had just driven around a sharp curve and due to the curve I was driving pretty slow.  There are lots of deer in this area and I am typically looking to see if any are close by.  There is a small creek bed in the curve with a large culvert running under the road connecting both sides of the street in that area.  Just past the curve I saw a tall, upright, black figure.  It was about 10 yards past the beginning of the treeline.  This creature was walking at an angle through the woods towards the creek.  I saw his right profile and the back of him. It appeared to have arms which were hanging at his side. There are lots of trees in this area so parts of his profile were blocked at times.  All of the leaves are off the trees at this so I had a pretty clear view.  He appeared to be 6-7 feet tall with black hair.  I'm not exactly sure what I saw but I know that it wasn't a deer.  This road has a pretty high amount of traffic in the morning and is highly guarded by Camp Robinson.",
