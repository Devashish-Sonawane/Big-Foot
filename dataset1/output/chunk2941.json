On the UIS soccer fields there was something at the edge of the field at the tree line. I glanced away and back and it was gone. It was a human shape but the shape from the head to the body was flowing with long hair all over. It was about 8 feet tall brown in color but was in the shade of the trees. Later that day is when the youth soccer league plays games there in the fields.",

The witness was impressed with how the hair appeared to flow. \u0095 As the animal was standing still the witness was unable to describe any movements.\u0095 Because of the amount of hair the witness was unable to see any facial features.  \u0095 The animal was approximately 150 feet from the witness.\u0095 With ten YMCA soccer fields the area does see very large amounts of children that come to play soccer.
