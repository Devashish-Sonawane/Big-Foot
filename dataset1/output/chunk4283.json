            "Observed.1  ": "Scott said they were out in the Frogtown area when the sighting occurred. \u0093We were going about 55 mph on a curvy road. It was really late-after midnight, I think. We hadn't passed any other cars, and this thing came out of nowhere,\u0094 Scott says. \u0093The officer hit the brakes and we both jumped out. We looked on both sides of the road but didn't see anything, and we looked at each other kind-of like, \u0091You saw that, didn't you? I saw that.'\u0094 Realizing the event had been recorded by the patrol car's dash cam, Scott and the officer returned to the Sheriff's Office where they viewed the happening on a larger screen. \u0093We were both just shocked,\u0094 Scott says. \u0093It was really tall, and it really looked like the pictures you've seen of Bigfoot.\u0094 The film found it's way onto the Internet, and that's how the Discovery Channel tracked Scott down, she says. \u0093I told them it all happened in seconds. It just came and went,\u0094 she says. The TV representative told Scott they are planning to visit the area in February and plan to camp out in the area where she and the deputy made the sighting. They may change their minds, however, when they learn that Sheriff Stacy Jarrard claims to have proven the sighting to be a hoax. Jarrard said he went out the next day to question homeowners in the area. At the first house he stopped at, he says, there were two young men, students at North Georgia College & State University, who were \u0093acting really nervous. You could see their hearts were beating really fast,\u0094 he says. The two did not admit to the prank right away, but later in the week they copped to one of them donning a gorilla suit and running across the road in front of vehicles on the night in question. Jarrard says he even has a photograph of the two boys with the gorilla suit. If Animal Planet does decide to not to visit Lumpkin, they will probably still most likely visit the North Georgia area. \u0093They sent us a letter requesting to film at Track Rock in Union County,\u0094 said John Campbell with the National Forest Ranger Station in Blairesville. \u0093The area is an archeological site, and is purported to have the footprint on Bigfoot.\u0094 \u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097 BFRO Note: These claims allegedly made by Sheriff Stacy Jarrard are false. There were no college students living in the vicinity. There is no photograph of a costume. Sheriff Jarrard apparently cooked up the cover story long after the incident. Why? There could have been many reasons for lying about it, possibly to extinguish the ongoing questions about the footage.  The incident was not investigated at all by the Sheriff\u0092s department and it remained an unknown among the local deputies for some time until Jarrard\u0092s the cover story was communicated to a local reporter, perhaps indirectly, and notably without said photo which supposedly showed the unidentified college students with the costume. The photo does not exist because the story was fabricated.",

            "Observed.1  ": "Stan is central Illinois\u0092 foremost expert on the legendary (mythical?) man-beast.  For 35 years, Stan lived in Pawnee and worked at St. John\u0092s Hospital in Springfield. He has retired and is living, well, all he\u0092ll say is that it is \u0093south of Springfield.\u0094 \u0093I don\u0092t want other researchers invading my territory,\u0094 he explains. There isn\u0092t much chance of that, since Bigfoot researchers appear to be on the sparse side. Be that as it may, Stan says his Bigfoot interest began when he was a boy in his native Idaho. \u0093I heard stories, read newspaper articles, when I was a kid about him,\u0094 Stan says. \u0093I had relatives who had contact and had seen him.\u0094 Since then, Stan\u0092s interest has grown into an avocation. Stan has spent nights out in the woods, listening and recording weird, unexplained sounds (you can hear them for yourself at his website, along with more conventional outdoor recordings). \u0093I\u0092ve interviewed over 200 witnesses who\u0092ve seen (Bigfoot),\u0094 Stan says. \u0093I literally know hundreds of people who\u0092ve seen these animals. There have been lots of them in central Illinois. I\u0092ve recorded lots of sounds that other researchers and witnesses believe come from these animals. People in Springfield don\u0092t realize it, but there have been a lot of reports from the Sangamon River around Riverton.\u0094 Already, I can hear the scoffing. Go ahead. Stan\u0092s used to it. It must, I told him, be like the UFO sightings. There have been thousands of reports of UFOs, but most people still dismiss the idea. Mere weather balloons. Meteorites. The aurora borealis. Airplanes. Lightning. Here is a report Stan documents concerning a Nov. 8, 2008, sighting in Macoupin County: \u0093I recently moved out of my house in Girard, IL. During the last year or so I have experienced several strange occurrences. \u0093I have never actually seen anything except once a large dark shape moving bipedally through the heavy fog. I have heard the sound of something drumming on tree trunks. The sound of something BIG walking in the woods, on 2 legs. I have found chunks of firewood thrown from my wood pile. And on November 25 of 2008, as I was packing to move I heard a moaning howl very close to the house. I have hunted for 20 years and I have NEVER heard the likes of this. \u0093I stopped loading the vehicle, loaded my .45 and locked the door. I did the rest of my packing the next two nights armed but as before I had the distinct feeling I was being watched and several times large branches were broken, and there was knocking on trees. \u0093Also there is an area of the woods where the grass and foliage is crushed down. This could be deer, but since these things have started occurring, the deer, who are usually thick as fleas have been gone.\u0094 The witness isn\u0092t named, which is not unusual for these reports of contact. \u0093There\u0092s a lot of ridicule that goes along with this,\u0094 Stan says. \u0093That kind of puts a damper on getting reports.\u0094 Stan is open about his belief in Bigfoot. He says he\u0092s too old to give a darn what people think. \u0093Maybe I would if I was 25 years old and starting a career where it might affect me,\u0094 he says. \u0093A lot of people who are in the field might own a business and don\u0092t want their customers to know. The other side of it is people don\u0092t care who knows it.\u0094 You have to admit, this is a fascinating hobby. Stan has been a member of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (http://bfro.net) since 2004. One of these days, he says, someone is going to find a dead Bigfoot carcass or one will be hit by a semi on the highway. Then all debate will be over. Until then, Stan will be out there somewhere, probably in a lonely, remote place in Illinois, recorder in hand \u0097 waiting.",
