            "Observed": "Let me set up the story with some information that is pertinent to the situation. I was in the Army stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia. My job at the time was as a gunner on a Bradley Fighting Vehicle. My unit was in the field conducting a training exercise which was to last a few days. The Bradley fighting vehicle is an armored tracked vehicle that normally has a crew of three; (Vehicle Commander, Gunner and Driver).",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke to the witness on Dec. 24, 2006. He is no longer in the military and works as a police officer. His sighting was very short, approximately 4 seconds during which the creature crossed an 18 foot wide road. An important element for me is the uniform coloration he observed through his thermal sight. This confirms my own observation with a thermal viewer during the BFRO's March 2006 Redwoods expedition (Northern California). The creature I saw was very tall and had a uniform heat signature. It had none of the bright spots seen on humans in clothes. Humans in clothes (costumes would reveal the same patterns) show noticeable variations in surface temperature. Exposed skin stands out brightly while the loose parts of clothing are cooler and darker . The figure observed with the thermal sight in Georgia showed the same characteristics I observed in the California Redwoods -- a uniform insulation density. The base camp of the Redwoods expedition was adjacent to a canyon where sounds had been heard earlier in the day. That night I was scanning the perimeter of the camp with a car-roof-mounted thermal viewer I observed a very tall figure walk to the edge of the camp, coming from the direction of the canyon where sounds had been heard a few hours before. It briefly walked out into the open, albeit in the dark, then reversed direction and walked rapidly back to the cover of trees. It had the same smooth gate and pronounced arm swing seen in the Patterson footage. From my position the figure appeared to walk by a bush which provided scale for a height comparison with a human. So the morning after the sighting I asked a 5' 7\" person to walk the same path. The comparison from the same angle showed that the figure I observed  the night before had to be at least 8 feet tall. The 5' 7\" person was would have come up to the chest of the figure I observed.",
