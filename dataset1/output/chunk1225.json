            "Observed": "I am from Madisonville KY. Last year I took my then' 8yr old daughter hunting during late youth weekend. The place where we went is some where my and my husband have been going for years. So we went in the woods got set up and as we were waiting, right at daybreak we heard a sound that I have never heard. The best way I can explain is it was like a howl and yell and growl altogether. It would hold a constant yell for about 30secs, we heard it 3x. between the Howls,yell,growl noise the coyote's would howl. But I KNOW that was not a coyote we heard. I tried not to let my daughter know that it scared me but she was ready to go after we heard that. I watch your all's show \"Finding Bigfoot\" and some of the sounds ya'll have recorded made my hair stand. I don't know if it was a Big Foot, but I'm not sure it wasn't either.",

She stated that the howls came from approximately 200 yards away, and that there were immediate responses by coyotes between the howls. She said the howls were not coyotes, bobcats, or any other animal she had heard. She and her daughter were very frightened and left the area. In the incident the previous November during adult gun season, she had heard the sound of a tree crashing. She described it as a heavy wood on wood sound. I believe it may have been an intimidation knock, intended to scare her out of the woods. I have heard these knocks during my own investigations. They are very powerful displays, and similar to what she described.",
