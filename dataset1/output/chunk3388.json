            "Observed": "I was camping with my family around Taylor resivor, towards Aspen in a Coleman pop-up camper.Around midnight I heard something moving or licking our cast iron skillet that was washed and left by a tree outside our camper. I got up and opened the door of our camper expecting to see a bear. At that time my friends dogs that were sleeping in his tent about 100 feet from our camper strated to bark. In the distance I saw a large dark object running into the woods. The suprising thing was that our camper started to shake rapidly. In the morning I asked my wife if she could feel the camper if I ran by it. I weigh 220 lbs and couldn't make it move at all. When this animal ran away from it it felt like an earthquake. Very Strange.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness the evening of August 11, 2008 and have the following details to add.  The witness, his wife, and a friend were camping in the Taylor Pass area between Aspen and Crested Butte.  They had retired to bed for the evening at approx 10:00pm.  Shortly after settling in, the witness\u0092s wife nudged him to say she heard something outside.  They listened for a few minutes and heard a lapping type noise and the skillet rattling that was setting on a folding camp table about fifteen feet behind the camper.  They quickly decided that a black bear was the culprit.  The witness opened the door expecting to chase a black bear away.  The camper shook as the culprit ran away.  The witness described seeing a large, dark, upright object moving swiftly away from the camp at a distance of about forty feet, and within a few seconds it disappeared into the dark timber.  The witness said it was too dark to make out any details.  No vocalizations were heard and the rest of the evening was quite.The next morning they asked their friend sleeping in the tent if he heard anything.  He was asleep, but was awakened by his dog barking at the commotion and didn\u0092t hear anything over the dog\u0092s barking. They looked for tracks but found none.  They attempted to recreate the camper shaking by running and jumping outside, but could not get the camper to vibrate as it did during the event, leaving them to believe the animal was substantial in size.   During the interview the witness said several times \u0093this was not a bear\u0094.  The witness camps often, lives in Aspen Colorado and frequently sees bears.  ",

Then it stood up as if it had been eating something on the ground.  It paused then proceeded to walk calmley across the top of this ridge steadily becoming more clear to my sight. It came close enough that I could hear the twigs breaking under foot.  After it traveled aprox. 80-100 feet it the went down the backside of the ridge.  And NO it wasnt a bear!  It was much bigger.  Color was dark - almost black.",
