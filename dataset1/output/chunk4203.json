The Marines told deputies that they were traveling west on Ave J, about a quarter mile east of 110th St. East, when a huge hairy thing, the shape of a man loomed ominously in front of their vehicle.  But, it didn't linger.  It turned and ran off into the desert, leaving the startled Marines who had just slammed on their car brakes.  ",

Sheriff Deputies who went out to the area where the Marines said they had the encounter with a big dark creature, said that the fields were hard packed, so there were no footprints. \tCoincidentally, at the time of the Marine incident, which occurred on the 14th of March 1973 at 1 A.M., there was a movie playing at a drive-in theater that was not to far away and called, \" The Legend of Bogge Creek.\" Which is supposed to be an extremely entertaining movie about such a creature of the Bigfoot variety.  Speculation could be that if the Marines had seen the movie and thus just about anything big and dark could have looked like the legendary Bigfoot.",
