She commented that something ate all the apples on the lower half of the trees on several occassions.- He once revealed his suspicions of \"bigfoot\" to his mother, and she said \"That would explain a lot of things.\" but didn't say anything more.- Although now much more developed, 10, 20, or 30 years ago this area outside of Menomonee Falls wasn't as populated, with plenty of farmland, woods, and swamp areas.",
