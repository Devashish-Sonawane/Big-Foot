            "Follow-Up Report": " I spoke with the witness by phone. He related that the trees which were pushed over were up to four or five inches in diameter. Initially they believed this was the result of someone clearing the trail, until they came upon a tree pushed across the trail. The tree damage was not the result of a storm.The witness noted that the branch breaking was loud; \"I honestly felt like someone was trying to scare us\". At first they thought it might be a person following them, but if so he was doing so through the woods with out a light. The vocalization was of relatively short duration, two to three seconds, but extremely loud. Of the vocalizations currently on the BFRO site the Puyallup whoop-howl is the closest match.Of other related stories the witness related that the wood knocking incident occurred in the summer at approximately 9 or 10 pm. It sounded like \"someone was beating on wood with a hammer\", but it came from within the woods near a creek. ",
