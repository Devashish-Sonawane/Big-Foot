He lives in Tatumville, less than 5 miles from the location of the sighting. He is married and has four grown boys. His wife and one of his boy was with him in the vehicle when the sighting occured but they didn't see the figure. He only saw it for a few seconds as it took a few strides in the direction of the river.Although his observation was brief the witness was very certain about what he saw. He is confident that it was not a person. It was 30 yards from the edge of the road. It was tall and covered with dark fur. He had a side view of it and said it had noticeably long arms.He doubts that a person would be walkiing in that bottom so close to that creek because it is \"so full of snakes.\"  Snakes may actually be an important food source for sasquatches.Here is a Google Maps link to the location: Click here..",
