He and his wife and daughters as well as another female friend of the family were on a research outing to old Mt. Zion Cemetery in Lawrence County, TN when this event occurred.  The wife and her friend are actually in the process of writing a book about paranormal activities (of the ghostly type) throughout the South. The husband is a photographer, researcher and published writer.I don't have much to add since he did an excellent job of recording the events of that day in his report.  He had posted his recording on You-Tube and I'm including a link here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN0onkNK4ZE",
