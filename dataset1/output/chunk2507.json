Using the trees at the location that the creature stood as a base, the witness estimated the animal at 7 and 1/2 ft. tall, and having a color described as \"chestnut\" or \"light brown\". As the creature moved away, the witness observed the shoulders and head of the animal. The witness owns a house in the area and is familiar with native wildlife. The color description and the details provided by the witness regarding how the creature moved seems to rule out a bear. While there are moose in the area, they generally do not move in the smooth and quick manner that was described. When they are disturbed by human activity, they commonly walk away slowly.  This area is in the vicinity of the Hudson River Gorge, a part of the Adirondack Mountains known for clean, fast-moving water sources, abundant wildlife, and dense forest with a lot of small cliffs and peaks.
