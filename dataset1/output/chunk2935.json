            "Follow-Up Report": "I went to the site and interviewed the original witnesses, as well as the brother-in-law, wife, and their daughter, actual owners of the property. They were all lucid, remembered things clearly and related them to me very matter of factly with no embellishment. All members of the family were down to earth, well-spoken, and very open to sharing all experiences. Though this started as one reported event, as we spoke, it became obvious there has been ongoing activity at this location for a seven year period. I will add to the original reported event the information I gathered as we spoke in detail, then I will also add the information from the actual owners of the property by pasting his email verbatim. This email dialogue relates the ongoing activity over the past seven years. I personally viewed and photographed the print AND cast, as well as gathered other photos relevant to the original report. I was also provided photos of the cast and print by the owner, who was quite meticulous in his recollections and photo evidence. Photo of the print:Photo of the casting:Here is the additional info from the original witness to add to this report.When he went out to flash the light on the source of the splashing, it stopped. It was standing in the water behind a willow tree that was on the shoreline, so it was hidden from view. There was also a bit of fog rising from the lake. When that splashing stopped, another began splashing appx 75 yards to the east. When he shined his light at the direction of that sound, it stopped, and began again in the original location, coming from something in the lake and behind the willow tree. He had a very powerful flashlight, but vision was hampered by the distance and fog. I have photos of both locations. This went on, going back and forth, for several minutes.I will now add the email from the owner that is cut and pasted into this report. Some of it is a repeat of the original report, but it is in context. It is his words verbatim:\"The night the encounter was reported by A., W. and I were on our way back from seeing a movie.  S. and A. were watching movies, projected in the barn, with a large surround sound system.  They experienced a sense of uneasiness, and also heard splashing, knocking, and observed the animals acting strangely.  Specifically, at a point of particular unease, a horse that was in the barn in a stall went outside, into the corral, only to return quickly, snorting as if frightened.  The dogs, staying distant from the barn, began barking as well.  Splashing was occurring in different areas of the lake, and what sounded like footsteps, large ones, in the water continued until flashlights were used. The following day, when A. found the foot prints, she called me to show them to me, which is when I went on a bit of a wild goose chase to find something to make the casting with. It was about 3 years ago when S., my daughter, saw a sasquatch, during a rain storm, under an apple tree, carrying something that might have been a deer carcass on its back. Since moving here 7 years ago, we have had seasonally consistent vocalizations (howls and chatter) and wood knocks.  We have found a deer carcass in the woods that seemed to be killed and consumed in the fashion described (broken and torn off legs). And we have periodically had feelings of \"being watched\" or \"getting spooked\" when walking around our property, even in well lit areas, at night. All told, my entire family (5 of us) have heard this stuff going on.  A. and S., of course. Other friends of ours have heard vocalizations as well. As is consistent with other reports, children laughing and playing outside seem to cause some curiosity, and even my kids now will sometimes do a call and get a response.\" They have also reported that on occasion, the horses will appear to be spooked by an unseen entity, and there are no known predators in the are that would make the horses react in fright. There is also a state nature reserve less than a mile up the road, which easily connects to their property via a creek and woods. Perfect habitat. I will add there were two other prints, but they had been obscured and all that was left was the heel. The measurements all coincided with the original print. The sightings and experiences have been going on at this location for about 7 years. Although the term habituation can take on a few different meanings, with the exception of feeding and personal interaction, there does appear to be an ongoing visitation experience.",
