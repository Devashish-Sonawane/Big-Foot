            "Observed": "My brother and I were out for a weekend of deer hunting in one of my favorite haunts in the Gifford Pinchot Nat. Forest.  A couple years back we had found a closed road that lead up to an enchanting pocket of old growth forest which allowed for decent visibility yet had vegetation that would seem to be sufficient to hide and feed wildlife.  I find old growth forests magical, but my brother found this spot somewhat spooky, due to its isolation and dead still quiet.  Nonetheless, we walked the 1.5 miles up the road into this forest, where the road terminates in a small ridge and a pocket of thick, second growth fir beyond that.  We seperated about 75 yards and sat for about a half hour just watching and listening.  That's when we heard some unusual sounds.  To my mind, they were kind of like a bird hoot or something, but the sounds were loud and nothing I'd ever heard before (not an owl).  These sounds occurred two or three times.  When my brother and I reunited, we both mentioned these sounds to each other and were confused because they were unusual to us both.  He did not think they sounded at all like a bird.  Since we had been out all day, we then decided to retire and head back down the trail.  About 6 months later we came upon the \"Whoop Howl\" sounds on the BFRO site and were both astounded to find that these were very similar to the sounds that we had heard during our hunting trip.",

            "Observed": "On Monday, June 30, 2008, between 5:00 a.m. and 5:15 a.m., I had the experience of hearing a chilling and unexplained sound.  I was taking numerous boxes and garbage bags from the garage to the end of my driveway at the street for trash pickup.  I had made approximately 6 trips back and forth when, after laying a box down at the curb, I heard something that made me stop in my tracks.  I experienced what I first thought was the start of a loud siren, a loud and ascending WHOOOOO\u0085, coming from across the street.  The sound came from a tree line about 200 feet away at the edge of Horseshoe Lake.  There are empty grated lots directly across the street from my house (about 125 feet deep) and then approximately another 25 feet or more of dense palmetto scrub and primarily pines and loblolly bay trees down to the lake shore.  The sound continued to ascend in pitch and when the pitch didn\u0092t change like that of a siren and I realized that a siren would not be coming from that direction, but rather from the highway behind our house, I felt somewhat panicked.  The sound ended in a booming \u0096OOP.  The entire whoop was long in duration and went from a low to high pitch.  It seemed to be aimed directly towards me and was extremely far carrying in tone.  I immediately felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  When my brain could not place the sound with any animal or bird that I am familiar with, I became very frightened at thinking that a man was watching me and calling out.  I started to take some steps backward towards the garage in anticipation that I would see something moving towards me across the empty lot.  Within seconds of the WHOOP, an owl called out with a common hooting from the top of a tree in that same area, as if it had been startled.  The owl\u0092s voice was very distinct from the other sound in the loudness and the way it carried, as well as the elevation of the source of the sound.  I went back into the garage and waited for about 5 minutes there to listen for any other sounds, but only heard the frogs that are common at that time.  Although still dark, there were clear skies at the time, and I could see the silhouette of the tree line.  My side of the street was dimly lit by the lights in the garage and street lights a short distance away.  I go out at this time every morning to haul trash and to take my dog for a quick walk out to the mailbox, and I am used to hearing numerous types of frogs, owls, and whippoorwills. As I stood there, logic told me that even a large man could not have made the resonating sound that I heard from that distance away.",

            "Other Stories": "As I was listening to the sound recordings on the BFRO website, I came across one clip that immediately made me flash back to another experience that I had shortly after we moved into this house.  Sometime around the month of February 2008, I went out onto our screened in pool/patio area to feed our cats at 5:00 a.m.  Because of the lights in the house and a light on the porch, the screen seemed opaque, so I couldn\u0092t see out.  I heard a very loud noise coming from the backyard of our next door neighbor\u0092s that startled me.  I quickly dismissed it as the sound of a sprinkler hitting our aluminum fence.  It was a metallic, chatter sound.  It lasted about the duration of what might be the rotation of about 180 degrees of a sprinkler head.  But then the sound abruptly stopped, and I could tell that neither our sprinklers nor our neighbors where on at the time.  Several seconds later, I heard the same chilling noise but I could tell that the source was now about 200 feet away.  I immediately felt frightened and went quickly back inside the house.  It really spooked me at the time, but I hadn\u0092t thought about the incident again until I heard a similar recording on your website, specifically the 1973 Whoop-Howl from Puyallop, Washington.  The sounds on that recording have that same high-pitched, metallic sound that I still recall from that morning.  The sound of the bobcat from the National Geographic sight also sounded somewhat metallic-like, so that may be another possible explanation.",
