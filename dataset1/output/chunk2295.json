            "Follow-Up Report": "Both witnesses were available for interviews. The witnesses recalled that they had finished \"burning the trash\" at the direction of the submitting witness's mother. They then found themselves playing and wandering at the back of the family land near the creek that connected to the Sabine River. The boys, who were best of friends, simultaneously noticed a strange animal at a distance of 100 yards or so. The animal appeared to be bipedally squatting and the boys thought that it appeared to be some sort of dark-colored, hair-covered \"large monkey.\" As the boys watched in excess of a minute, the strange creature would raise one arm momentarily, then raise the other, then appear to stand somewhat upright before resuming a squatting position. It seemed to be facing the boys and crouched in front of a tree or possibly leaning on the tree - the boys could not be certain. After a minute or so of observing the curious creature, the boys hastily returned home. They became frightened when they began to ponder what it was that they were witnessing. They told no one for a long period of time after the sighting, for fear of ridicule. When the boys finally did share their experience, friends and family members alike teased and ridiculed them.In East Texas, many sighting reports are concentrated along the Sabine River Basin. Though this report is older, I consider it to be significant and relevant to our current, ongoing field research in the Sabine River Basin area. According to the witnesses, the site has remained undeveloped and has changed very little, if at all. The witnesses also remarked that human activity is nearly nonexistent in the area. The area is heavily wooded, is probably no more than ten miles from the Sabine River, is in an area of low human population density and annual rainfall is approximately forty inches. ",
