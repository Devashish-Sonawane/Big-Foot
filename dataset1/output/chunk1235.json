She noted that a mule\u0092s knee could only become swollen if someone had wrenched the leg in an attempt to break it (see the Deer Kill articles on the BFRO website).  Mules can\u0092t wrench their own legs so something with hands would have had to wrench (twist) it in order to make the joint swell.  She doesn\u0092t believe a normal human would have the strength to wrench it that hard.  Since mules will use their front legs to defend themselves and would not normally allow someone close enough to do them harm, whatever did the damage had to have \"snuck up\" on her.  It is very possible that the injury to Nancy may have been caused by whomever/whatever screamed that night.",
