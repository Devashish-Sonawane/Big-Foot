            "Observed": "First, as a matter of background, I want to tell a little about myself. It will help explain the delay in ever having reposted this incident. The sighting occurred about three months prior to my entering the United States Army. I served for three years as a Paratrooper with a Top Secret Clearance. After my time in the service, I became a Los Angeles Police officer. I did that for thirteen years and am now a Federal Agent, working for an O.I.G. out of Washington DC. With that background, you can probably understand my reluctance to discuss this sighting with too many people. It really boils down to a potential career killer.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I received the following e-mail from M.W. today the 10th of September, 2007.Hi Richard, Thank you for getting back to me so fast. I am pretty sad that it took me this long to report it and I wonder how valuable (if at all) the information is, so many years after the fact.  It did feel good to get it out on paper though. My children (all grown) have heard this story all of their lives, but somehow making it official (by way of the report to you) feels so much better.  M.W.P.S. I did not know that there was Bigfoot activity in that area in the 1970s. I would love to hear the details. Were there sightings in the same area that I saw him? It would not surprise me because there have been people living in that area for years. Talked with M.W. on the afternoon of 10 September, 2007, and he now lives in Virginia. We went over his report as best as possible after twenty seven years, and his memory of he and his friends encounter is still very vivid in his mind. M.W. is a very credible and interesting person to talk with especially on the subject of his Sasquatch sighting. I needed to pinpoint his exact sighting location, because I now live about 12 or so miles from where this took place, so I would like to visit and see what is going on there now.  Per the witness this creature walked up right, but slightly bent forward, and it lumbered something like an elephant might do because of its size, but still it was very agile, and it was very unconcerned while two young men, who were armed, were watching it as it moved off and into the trees in no big hurry. The witness\u0092s were within 30ft, of this large hairy creature, and observed it for about 15 seconds. The witness went on to describe the face as looking something like the caricature in Harry and the Henderson\u0092s, but the face did not look as goofy, also the eye area seemed dark but with less hair than the rest of the face. The legs were very thick, and the arms looked very long for its size, because as he has stated it looked to be some where between 8\u0092 and 9\u0092 tall, and weighed well over 300 lbs.The witness measured the foot prints by putting his size 12 boot into one of the prints and it was 4 to 5 inches longer and several inches wider that his boot. They both knew instantly what they were looking at during their encounter and it was no guy in a suit, but had to be a Bigfoot. M.W. is now working on a drawing, hopefully he said \u0093with help,\u0094 of what he and Craig saw on that evenings sighting of a Sasquatch. I do believe M.W. and his friend saw a Sasquatch in that area of the Leona Valley during that time period. I will attempt to make it to that location and let you know what is happening there now! I use the word attempt, because we have had a lot of fires in this area lately, and the Forestry folks have many areas closed off.Today, October 9th of 2007, the wife and I located the area where this incident took place with the help of a very old Forest Ranger; when asked if he knew of a place that had an old church camp just a little ways up a dirt road that was off to the right and had two mines located just a little ways further in? He pointed to the map and said, \u0093That\u0092s up this South Portal canyon road, but the mines are not mines they are tunnels that the water works people put in sometime in the early 1900\u0092s.\u0094  This South Portal Canyon road is located on the south east end of Grass Mountain and hooks up with the roads that my friend Frank and I have been investigating for the past several weeks.The area was very evident after you see it, because you know where the two boys spent there first night and where they spent their second night. It is about two plus miles off of San Francisquito Canyon Rd.  The tunnels will be difficult to observe do to vegetation growth. On our outing today, the wife and I observed deer and quail in this area which is now very dry due to a severe drought that has befallen our part of the state. I had to revise the location detail section because it was not right as received",

            "Observed": "I was camping with a friend in the Uwharrie National Forest.  We camped by the first creek bottom on the North section of Dutchmans Trail.  We turned into our hammocks about 7:30pm and soon everything started.  I heard a lot of moving about on the other side of a nearly dry creek bed around 8:00 pm.  The movement was a large animal by the sound of the larger branches breaking.  The animal came across the creek near a spot we had been using as our latrine.  I turned on my headlamp and yelled out \"go on\" thinking bear or something.  The movement stopped but then started closer to the camp so I yelled out again.  Then I got a bit scared when two rocks were smashed together \"bang, bang (pause) then bang bang\" again. This freaked me out a bit so I yelled again.  Then above me on the hillside I heard something being thrown through the woods and landing further down the small valley we were in.  Then the day birds started chirping in an arc across the hill side.  Not long after an owl started hooting quite far away.  Dogs started barking all over the forest and the owl stopped.  Then I heard a wail deeper in the woods and it seemed like after the wail the woods went back to normal.  I have spent a lot of time in the woods but this chain of events that went on from 8:00pm to around 12:00 am has unnerved me a bit.  I knew of these creatures but half believed in them but I have had an experience that has changed how I feel in the woods at night.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone three days after his encounter and the details of the activity were very fresh on his mind.The witness is ex-military and has spent a great deal of time in the woods.He and his friend were camping at the intersection of the Dutchmans Creek trail and the Uwharrie trail. They both went to bed around 7:30pm. the activity began around 8:00pm. It started with loud crashing, limb breaks and intimidating behavior. He heard something walking in arcs just above their campsite, and it kept going back and forth crashing trees and being extremely noisy. The witness yelled at it to \"go on\". Things got quiet for a minute but started back with movement closer to camp. It crossed the dry creek bed which was about 100 feet from camp. Rocks being banged together loudly numerous times was heard. The witness yelled again, this was at 9pm, then a large rock went thru the trees and landed very nearby. He also noticed daytime birds chirping in an arc above their camp site, and an owl hooting. He noted he felt the woods felt different, with a strange energy level. Things quieted down after awhile. Then he heard dogs barking everywhere and at midnight heard a long loud \"wailing' sound. He described it as along drawn out vocalization that sounded like it was in pain. I imitated the Ohio - Moaning Howl for him and he said that was exactly the sound he heard.The witness was extremely disturbed by all this activity and they immediately left the area the next morning, he described himself as \"freaked\" out by these events. His views of the woods have been changed.The Uwharries have been a \"hotbed\" of Sasquatch activity over the years. Montgomery County, North Carolina leads the state in reports. It has the perfect conditions for a large biped to exist. There is a mixture of farmland and remote forests, which provide cover and food. Waterways are abundant, with the Uwharrie River and its tributaries, Badin Lake and Lake Tillary to the West, with abundant wildlife, deer, rabbits, wild turkeys, raccoons, opossum and water fowl.",
