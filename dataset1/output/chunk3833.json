This incident stuck with him for years, assuming it was a very tall man in a monkey suit trying to scare them. The strange thing was that he did not try very hard to scare the boys, no yelling or coming at them. It wasn't until much later when he learned of Bigfoot that he realized that what they encountered on the river that night was most likely not a man in a monkey suit.  ",
