            "Observed": "I live in the Olympics, and usually in the Spring I hear a high pitch scream in the forest about 600' from my cabin.  It is very scary, makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up, I go into my cabin, and I don't come out- this is mid morning time.  This year I didn't hear the screachy scream in the Spring.  I took my grandchildren for a walk in the woods in search of mushrooms and discovered a hole in the ground with branches over it.....???????????  It wasn't a tool dug hole in the ground, but that of an animal with the fine throwing of the soil.  I didn't think much of it since there was a beer can thrown in it, but still my curiosity was profound.  We left the woods.  Within a week of this happening, 70 ' across the road from my cabin came a very loud whistle, scream, and huge growling noise, all simultaniously, and witnessed by five people.  I have experienced rocks being thrown at my cabin, and the most scary was when I looked across the road a few nights ago and saw whitish blue bright eyes- with no lights shining on them!  Is this a Sasquatch?  It is frightening me very much.  Before this experience my daughter and I had been smelling something like rotten dead animal smell.....and it was coming from under my porch.......when I had the maintenance man look under there....nothing there!...but the smell.  A few days ago my daughter and I smelled the smell of fresh earth dug up two days in a row, but there has been no digging here.  If this is a Sasquatch, why isn't it leaving here and migrating?",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and met with her in person accompanied by two other Seattle area investigators. Because the animal that made this vocalization sounded very large, the witness was initially very concerned for the safety of her grandchildren in a nearby cabin. Besides the witness, five others also heard the loud vocalization and described it as a cross between a peacock in distress and a gorilla ending with deep growl. Her daughter, who was standing 150 yards away, said that the vocalization sounded like a car driving into a chain link fence and scraping against it. The son-in-law is a hunter and was unable to say what the sound was other than the fact that it was loud and was unlike anything that he had ever heard before. The investigators found some inconclusive evidence and the area will be studied further. ",

            "Observed": "It was 3 a.m., I having hard time sleeping went out onto 2nd floor deck which is about 10+ feet high. The house is on the Ocean side so critters and brush moving is normal but this night was different, it was very dark and too quiet, not even a frog croaking.  I heard an extra amount of brush rustling then normal, then a high pitched animal screamed out, which I now identify as a rabbit in great distress (I put out food for the wild rabbits). A short span of silence then something stumbled or fell and let out a deep moan.  I rain into the house to grab a flashlight and went back out on the deck. As I was trying to find the switch for the dang ancient lantern type flashlight I heard more brush moving, then 4 loud thuds on this fake wooden dock that's on the northern edge on the lot. The dock goes into the brush where fresh water collects during rain season and just ends, is about 20 feet long and begins at the edge of the yard which is also the NW corner of the deck support. Four thudding stomps then off the dock onto the lawn, two more stomps and the creature stopped directly below me standing above on the deck.  I froze, it froze and then it started smelling me! Deep long inhales, short outs, I could not see much thru the deck boards just something dark and big and frankly it was so frightening that this creature was just a foot or so underneath me below my feet. I said screw the lantern and ran for the house.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I called the reporting witness on 5/11/12. This location is the last row of homes between the beach and other dwellings. From the back deck, one can see the ocean. The deck is a measured 11\u0092 from the grass below.  There is no access to the deck from ground level. One has to go through the house to get there. There is very dense brush between the house and the dunes near the water. The height of this brush is approximately 15 feet.. She said that their dog had been recently been alerting to something out behind their house. She said that the previous week, they had seen eyes looking over the bushes at them.I asked about the reported occurrence, which happened back in July 22-28, 2009. She said that she had heard what sounded like a screaming rabbit that was being killed. They have wild rabbits that she puts food out for. It was dark outside. She went out on the deck in her nightgown to see what was going on. When she did so, something very large, with heavy foot-steps, walked from the brush, up a fake dock at ground level and right under her. She was standing roughly in the center of the deck. The creature was inhaling deeply and then rapidly exhaling, then another long inhale. She said that it was scenting her. The deck boards are \u00bd inch apart. She felt that its face was only about 1 foot below her. She had a very old, 1950s style battery lantern, and she was so flustered that she could not get it on, so she ran back into the house.On 5/12/13, I drove over to the location. This location is only a half mile from the Report #40381  location, so they might be related. During the interview, she mentioned that she had seen a small, hairy animal that she likened to a \u0093Tasmanian Devil cartoon character\u0094. I asked her more questions about it, as she had never mentioned that before. She said that she was again up on the deck, looking into the cleared lot to the north, when this little thing came out of the brush, ran toward her along the edge of the brush about 20 feet, spun around a couple of times as if deciding which way to go, and then ran into the brush. She did not know if it saw her. She said it was about the size of a dog, had no tail, moved like a monkey, and was very fast. She grew up in rural Washington, and knows the common animals that live here. This was nothing she could identify. I have heard that description from at least four other people at four different locations. All these locations are associated with sasquatch habituation sites. This may be a very young sasquatch. I did a survey of the property. The brush is very thick. One can go 2 feet inside and vanish. The two main bedrooms have large windows that face the back of the property and they are on the ground floor. The blinds are the type that give privacy during the day, but at night, with the lights on inside, one can see into the room. From the brush, a creature could see in either window. Also there is a linear line of brush, probably 7 feet tall that parallels the back of the home about 30' away. Behind this row of brush is an open area. At either end of the open area is a bird-house on a 10\u0092 pole. I found that a creature could stand there and watch the people on the deck, or inside the large living room space on the second floor. There are windows clear across the back, and along the sides of the home. I was able to go back into that space and look back at the house. It is an ideal spot to view the people inside the home yet remain behind cover.The following weekend, 5/18/13, I was invited back. The sister who is the actual owner was there. They said that they had found little hand-prints in the sand where the little creature was seen. Personally, I could not see it. However, I did go ahead and cast one of what they thought might be a hand print, which I left with them. We all three made a more extensive trip into the brush behind the home. I found nothing to indicate that any sasquatches had been there in near past. Later, after dark, the sister and I made a night walk to the beach, then back-tracked to the first row of dunes, where we climbed up on top. We stood there for about 15 minutes, observing back towards the homes. Seeing nothing, we then walked back to the house. From the house, we walked the road in a south direction for about \u00be of a mile. There are many homes which were not occupied, and were dark. I noticed several places where it looked like a large animal was crossing the road. There were cave-like openings in the brush on either side of the road. There were also few street lamps, which would make unseen movement in the dark quite easy.Later, I went over to visit the witness from report 40381. He said that some people had come over to talk with him. They wanted him to have me call them. One of the people answered my call. They have not filed a report and do not wish to. They only live \u00bc of a mile north of the witness who submitted this report. This is why I am including this information. I initially talked to the husband. He said that they were taking some pictures of driftwood out near the beach, and they found a set of very large tracks. There were five tracks. No pictures were taken. Then, he had me talk to his wife.She has a habit of going out on their deck to smoke at night. She reported hearing vocalizations that she could not identify coming from the SE, which would be the direction of the witness from report 40381. This was at the same time of year as the activity there. She said that they were mournful \u0093Waaaaaaaaaaaaa\u0094 vocalizations. They didn\u0092t know what they were, and wanted to tell someone. Then, she mentioned that something killed a deer in the cleared vacant lot to the north of their property.  She said that she didn\u0092t know what it was. I asked her more questions about it. She described it as running on all fours. It was hair covered. It had no tail. I asked about the face; did it have a snout like a bear? She said that it was \u0093mushed-in\u0094. She said it was much bigger than a wolf. It upset her because it took a long time for the deer to die. As the creature left the lot waking on two hind legs and one fore-leg, it was holding part of the deer in the other. She said that she yelled at it. It just turned its head and looked at her and kept going. I asked about the eyes. She said that they were \u0093piercing\u0094. It then went out of sight. In the morning, she called the city to come remove the deer carcass, which they did. Based on the proximity to Report 40381, and the phone-report from nearby, there is clearly a pattern of likely sasquatch activity in this area. Although it has quite a lot of houses, I noticed that most are not occupied. They are also surrounded by very dense brush. There is ample cover to hide a large nocturnal creature, and it is dark enough that they could move about without much chance of being seen. The cave-like openings in this brush indicate that something larger than deer is using them. This is another example of how close they can live to people without being observed.",
