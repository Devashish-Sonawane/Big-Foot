It was sort of a grunting yell, very deep and it echoed through the neighborhood.  It sent the hair up on my neck and scared me a little because the only thing between me and the yelling was a row of houses.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.She described the first sound as an \"OOMPH\" ...maybe one second long, but heard three times.  It originated from the cornfield behind her residence. She also heard one or two footfalls (squishy sounding) from the reaped field. The backyard of her house (and neighbors) are between 110-120 feet deep. The footsteps the witness heard were therefore only 200-300 feet from her house. The next week, her neighbor saw a huge human shaped shadow cross by their front window.  The witness heard another OOMPH the following night.  The November incident (2020) occurred when the witness was walking home from a friend\u0092s house.  She heard the neighborhood fox make a call, followed by what she stated sounded like a drunk guy trying to imitate it a couple of blocks away.  Then, even further away, a female voice tried to imitate it too. Then in the far distance (possibly across the lake), a childlike version of the Ohio Howl was audible. This was followed by the male deep guttural yell that echoed through the community and caused the witness\u0092s hair to stand up on her neck. Next, a feminine sounding short version of the Ohio Howl was heard, followed by a childlike voice in response. This went on for 20 minutes, occurred a little after 2300 hours, and as the sounds progressed they got further and further away til drowned out by vehicle noise.  ",

            "Observed": "Went camping at Lake Jeanette in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota. First night we were there we heard wood knocking. Knocked back and got three distinctive and separate responses. As we started to go to bed we heard a whooping noise. The next day we hiked out into the area which the sounds came from; no camps, nothing out there. After a long day of hiking and and swimming we went back to camp, ate dinner, and that night we started the knocks. Again we hear three responses. One of the three got closer and closer after each time we responded back. My friend got creeped out and we left the woods and sat at our camp site. As we are sitting by out fire we both saw a set of eyes staring at us. Neither one of us said anything about the eyes to the other until we were on our way home. We decided to go back into the woods for one last time and as we did something very close to us made a loud grunt. I've hunted since I was 12, I have heard bears, moose and everything else that would be in the woods of Minnesota and I have no idea what this was. We took down our tent and left within 20 minutes of this grunt. I don't know what was there but we both felt like it didn't want us there.",
