            "Follow-Up Report": "I initially met this witness at the Sasquatch Summit in Ocean Shores, Washington. My friend, Judy Locke, introduced me to him, and said that he had a sighting recently. We talked for a few minutes, and I asked him about his sighting. He said that it was on September 30th 2013 because he had just gone to Hoquiam to get his social security check, and was driving home on Hwy 109 when the sighting occurred. It was 1:00PM approximately when he crossed an iron bridge, rounded a corner onto a straight-away, and suddenly saw a buck deer run across the road from right to left. The deer was running at full-out speed. The witness said that he has hunted enough to know that when a deer is running like that there is something chasing it, so he slowed down to avoid hitting whatever it might be that was pursuing the deer. As he slowed, a very large bi-pedal creature ran across the road very close in front of him. The creature crossed the road in three steps. The witness stopped his car in the road. The creature by this time had stopped at the top of the road embankment on the south side, 24 feet from him. When it was running, it was bent forward at the waist. When it turned to face him, he described its movements as \u0093helicoptering\u0094 as it spun around bent forward and arms stretched out. It stood up straight. He said it was about eight feet tall, and that his head would have reached to the creature\u0092s armpit. It was all gray, and its hair was fairly thin. The hair on the back was quite thick, like a sheep, but it was less thick and shorter everywhere else. The hair on the head was what he described as \u0093lead hair\u0085like a hippie\u0094. The sun was behind the creature, and the witness said that the hair on its head was thin enough to be able to see the shape of the skull. The skull looked like any normal human, no bony sagittal crest, but that the hair was pushed up in the middle to look like it had a cone-shaped head. Its head was 16-18 inches in height. He could see the genitalia. He said that it looked like any normal uncircumcised male. Other than the size, and hair covering, it looked like any normal human, but very muscular, with good definition. The aspect that did look different from a human was that the hands seemed to be attached to the arms turned thumbs-in by 45 degrees. He could see the little pinky fingers as it stood there looking at him.He estimates that they stared at each other for a full minute. It might have been less, as time seems to stop in such situations. After about a minute of looking at it, wondering what to do next, and being in an open 1951 MG sports car, he made a little hand wave and said, \u0093Hi\u0094. This is when the creature pulled it lips back in a bare-teeth threat expression and yelled what sounded like the words, \u0093Sheea-hooah-Huh!\u0094 The witness said that the creature was very loud, and he could feel a vibration as it yelled at him. It then made a palms-down \u0093shoo-go away\u0094 gesture a couple of times and then \u0093helicopter turned\u0094 away and disappeared into the brush, its hands and arms making a swimming like movement as it parted the brush.He remarked that the teeth were all yellow, chipped, and some were missing. It is quite likely that this creature was old.After the witness got home, he decided that he better sketch what he saw before the memory fades. He is not a professional artist, but he did a very good job. He sketched these pictures. This witness commented that he never believed that these creatures could actually exist, and laughed at Report #40381, thinking that witness to be crazy. He said that he never thought he would see one himself. An interesting coincidence is that this witness only lives about \u00be of a mile away from the witness in Report 40381.I found this witness to be completely genuine. The emotion he demonstrated when relating the account was not faked in my opinion.  When telling me about the encounter, his hands began to shake and I could hear the emotion in his voice.",
