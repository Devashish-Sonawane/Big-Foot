            "Follow-Up Report": "After a lengthy phone conversation with the witness, the following information may be added to his report:-The witness was an active duty Marine stationed with his unit at Quantico Marine base. -During a 2008 training event, his unit flew by helicopter into the training ranges of Fort A. P. Hill near Bowling Green, Virginia.-After disembarking and maneuvering through the training ranges, his unit set up a bivouac to sleep for the night.-While pulling guard duty, with two other Marines, between 2 and 4 a.m., the witness looked up from his seated position on the ground and saw a large human shape standing in the trees above him.-He estimates the figure was 30 feet from him, and above him on a 45 degree angle. Its body was heavily built and the total body height was between 7 and 8 feet. It was silhouetted against the starlit sky and stood out clearly.-It appeared to be holding onto the trees with long outstretched arms, but he could not make out what its feet were resting upon.-The Marine blinked his eyes to test and clear his vision, the figure remained. He blinked his eyes a second time and then saw the figure move silently from one large tree to the next.-He blinked his eyes a third time, and the figure vanished from sight.-In the morning, the Marine made no mention of his observation during the unit's meeting before moving out. Unbidden, the second Marine who'd been on watch, at a location removed from the witness, asked if anyone had seen something in the trees the night before.-The third Marine responded in the affirmative, and described a large man-like figure moving silently through the trees above the unit's position. He too was observing from a position apart from the first two men on guard.-In discussion afterward, the three Marines came to the conclusion that they had all seen the same figure, high above their posts, traversing silently through the old growth trees and circling their unit's position.-Since this event, the first witness has been honorably discharged from the Corp, the second is deployed to Afghanistan and unavailable for comment, and the third has fallen out of contact.",
