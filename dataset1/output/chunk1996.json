            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on the phone for 15 minutes.  He had a good memory of the incident.  The witness was hunting for whitetail deer on family property.  His stepfather was also on the property but was about a mile away.  The witness was set up in a makeshift blind made from a downed tree.He said the sky was overcast and there was no moonlight, so it was very dark.  He said the temperature was around 25 degrees.The witness mentioned that they have 200-300 goats on the property and that the goat herd often ruined their hunting trips by herding themselves into the area where they would be set up to hunt from.  He said that the morning of this incident he could hear the goat herd coming towards him but that shortly before the footsteps started the goat herd moved off in another direction.  He said the footsteps approached from the East as he faced north.  He could hear deep, heavy, labored breathing but no other sounds besides the footsteps.  Even when the animal fell he didn't hear any sort of vocalizations or anything.  He reported that he didn't smell anything but that it was very cold and it would've been hard notice any odors.After daylight approximately where he heard the animal fall he found the ground scuffed up.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "As the witness and her son were driving to her mother\u0092s house early in March of 2009, they came upon a creature standing in the middle of the road just beyond her mother\u0092s driveway. Upon seeing the creature standing there, she immediately stopped the vehicle.The creature stood very still in place and did not move from the spot where the witness first saw it. The two startled witnesses watched the creature for a few minutes at an estimated distance of 200 feet. The creature stood in the middle of the road for the duration of the encounter, which lasted two to three minutes at the most. The witness described the creature as seven to eight feet tall, with a muscular build like a football player in full gear. She described the creature\u0092s hair as a two-toned brown, shaggy, and about two to three inches long. The fur was not matted, but appeared coarse and thick. She said the evening was calm, with no wind, so she did not see the hair move at all. She said the creature looked off toward the river during the whole encounter, which is about 150 feet to the west of where the sighting occurred. The creature never looked directly at the vehicle. She said the vehicle headlights illuminated the creature, but only from the chest down, thus she did not get a look at the creature\u0092s face. The encounter ended when the witness turned onto her mother\u0092s driveway and continued on to her mother\u0092s house, which is approximately 500 feet away down a semi-wooded driveway.The witness stated that during the encounter she did not feel afraid, or that she and her son were in any type of danger. She feels that she and her family have come to terms with the fact that there may be some sort of creature(s) living in the area, and are at ease with that fact, because it seems to them that the creature(s) have caused no harm to them, their property, or their animals. Also, in this report, the witness mentions tracks that were seen crossing her mother's property in the winter of 2007. She and her family discovered several sets of tracks which appeared in the snow at her mother\u0092s farm. The tracks seemed to appear every two weeks or so. The track lines would traverse through her mother\u0092s yard, always from south to north, and they never seemed to deviate from their south - north orientation. The track line would enter the property from the south and continue in a northerly direction, as if passing through the area on its way to another area. At one point, a family member followed the tracks, but lost the trail near the river. I find this witness to be very credible. She was very sincere and frank with me as she told me the details of what she saw that night in the road. ",
