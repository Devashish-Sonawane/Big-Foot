            "Observed": "One evening my girl friend and I went for a ride to look for deer. We would take rides three or four times a week mostly riding the back roads. One evening as we were driving down a road (Rader Road towards County BB) I noticed someone walking in the ditch on the right side of the road. At the time I kept my eyes on him because I thought he was walking on the roadway, as I drove nearer I noticed that he was walking in the ditch. About this time my girl friend ask me what that was walking on the roadway, I told her that it was not walking on the roadway but in the ditch which was about 5 feet below the roadway. I knew the depth because my brother and I went smelting there a few times. I explained to her that what ever was walking there had to be about 8\u0092 or 9\u0092 feet tall. She wanted to turn around and drive by it again to get a closer look I told her no that we would go around the back way which would take about 30 minutes, I wanted it to be gone when we came back.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with the witness on 5-1-2011. He was 19 years old at the time and recalls it like yesterday. I also spoke with his wife and she also gives the same account.Additional information that can be added:The witnesses guessed the height to be 8-9 feet, possibly weighing in excess of 300 lbs, wide shoulders and uniformly dark in color. The animal was walking west while they were driving east, moving easily through the ditch.I find both to be credible as to what they saw.This was in the same vicinity that he had his first encounter with a large creature, Report #27630.
