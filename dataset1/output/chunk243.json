            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witnesses, they hike this area frequently. There has been other suspected activity at this location, see Report #46973. While hiking the perimeter of Felton Pond, the 3 witnesses had a large rock thrown at them. The rock struck a tree. They were able to locate the rock. They describe the rock as being the size of a candlepin bowling ball, approximately 5 pounds. Here is a photo of the pond: While looking over the area where they think the rock came from, they located a fresh 18\" bass fish, and took this pic. The fish was still wet. It was sitting on top of a rock. The fish seemed to be pointing towards a foot path. There were no marks on the fish to indicate it was hook caught. October 2015 we took the Massachusetts BFRO expedition to the location.  We broke up into several teams and searched the area for evidence. We were able to locate the bones from the bass fish that was seen a few months earlier. It appeared several small critters had a snack with it. This is the second time visiting this location. There are several reports from this area in the Southern Berkshires.The witnesses continue to hike the area as do the BFRO investigators. This report will be updated should further information come out. ",
