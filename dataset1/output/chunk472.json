            "Follow-Up Report": "This report was originally submitted in 2005, and unfortunately was not looked into and misfiled. Thankfully, the witness filed another report almost 8 years later.  I was able to pull up the original report and found that even after all these years his story remains the same. The only hesitance was that the witness couldn\u0092t remember if it had happen in 2005 or 2006 (the original filing date clarified the year.)  I found him to be very honest and credible. I\u0092m pleased he filed his story again and that I have been able to verify it.In late May of 2005, the two men were shining a light into the lake looking for alligators. Google Earth image of the area:It was after 11:00 pm and still cloudy as it has rained on and off all day. As they walked down a nature trail-like dock that runs along the east side of the lake, the trees next to it started shaking violently.  They were startled but thought it was a vagrant and shouted at the source to stop and attempted to scare it away.  It stopped for a few moments when they heard what sounded like a bat hitting a tree about a dozen times.  They continued to yell at the noise source. At that time they noticed a tree top about 20-30 feet from the dock start rocking and saw it fall. This frightened them so much they turned tail and ran. As they ran, they heard grunting and heavy steps, parallel to them.  It kept pace.They returned about an hour later and found the tree had been broken by what appeared to be a twist (not cut) about 8 feet high. It was evident it was a fresh break because sap was still wet and dripping. The tree was estimated to be more than 20 feet high. The men had found a hair on the tree just under the 8 foot break.  One of the men carried this hair with him until his death in 2008.  It was described as a thick hair with a brownish red hue.The surviving witness remembers putting the cantaloupe in the tree, but couldn\u0092t remember the details after all this time. This location of this incident has a green area that connects to Bulow creek which has had several credible reports in the past few years. The actions described have the hallmarks of sasquatch intimidation activity which include tree breaking, knocking, pushing over trees, and \u0093escorting\u0094 people out of the area. The men mentioned another story in the area of two ladies seeing an \u0093ape man\u0094 cross the road.  I was able to speak with both senior ladies and their report is report #40034.",

We had, at the time, a white standard poodle named Charlie, and when I asked him if perhaps he'd just seen her instead, he denied it vehemently, exclaiming, \"How could Charlie have got that big?!\"  I went out to see if I could find any trace of anything, but the ground was baked hard and there were no tracks of any sort.  An acquaintance suggested a day or two later that I look for hair caught on a branch, which I did, but I found nothing.  Less than a week later, a cougar was spotted in our neighbor's field, so I thought perhaps this was what my son had seen, or perhaps a deer, with bright sunlight shining on its fur, making it seem white.",

He largely described shapes, colors, and feelings.  When asked for details on anatomy, he had little to add.  He did note that its arms hung to its sides and were big. He described the color as an ivory white, which could indicate an albino individual. On a side note, the location of the sighting (Yacolt, WA) is rich with bigfoot history.  The name \"Yacolt\" actually means the \"place abounding in evil spirits,\" which seems to be a likely sasquatch reference.",
