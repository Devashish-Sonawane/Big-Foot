            "Observed": "October 1996. While deer hunting with brother, observed two sets of clearly defined footprints in mud. Prints were human in shape, with slightly different characteristics. Five toes, proportionally wider than a human footprint. One print was about 18\" in lenth (about 7\" wide), the other was about 10\" by 4\". Prints were so well defined that skin texture and hair imprints could be seen. *Note: Brother and I are both very familiar with both Grizzly and Black Bear prints. These prints were neither. Five minutes after discovering the prints, a very loud pounding began in the densely wooded area downhill from our position. Sound was similar to that of a base drum, or a large rock on a hollow log. We estimated the sound to be coming from no more than 50' away, and bagan moving away. 300-yards from the first set of prints, we came upon a third set of prints which appeared (in size) to fit somewhere between the first two sets.",
