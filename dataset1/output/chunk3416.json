            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness via telephone. He gave a very detailed account of the sighting reported here, as well as sharing with me a plethora of experiences that his family had over the years at this location. The house that the family shared had a large, unfinished basement with an opening to the outside. Often various family members would find large impressions in the ground there, as well as certain food items, particularly apple cores. This particular sighting happened as the witness and his siblings were playing outside. They noticed a large, hair-covered figure under the house, in the unfinished basement, watching them closely. The witness initially thought he was looking at a gorilla. The children came nearer to it, and began to remark about how human-like its face looked. The witness described its demeanor as calm, and its face seemed to have a smile. I asked him if it was showing its teeth, thinking that perhaps it was displaying aggression, but the witness said that its mouth was closed, and the impression that the children had at the time was that it was smiling. The children threw a few small stones at it, but it remained calm inside the unfinished basement. The children became quite frightened, and ran inside the house. The witness lived at this location with his grandparents, mother, and siblings from 1959 until 1967. He stated that over the course of these years, various family members had several sightings of these creatures on their property. The sightings included watching one steal chicken eggs from a coop on the property, and watching one eat apples directly from a large apple tree. There were also accounts of hearing screams and calls in the surrounding woods, and seeing the eyeshine of one or more individuals peering into the house as well. The witness described the eyes as \"illuminated\" and large, with a red hue. These incidents were numerous, and spanned across the years. His family believed that a small group lived in the immediate area. Several of the closest neighbors were aware of these creatures as well. He remains confident about what he saw and experienced so many years ago. I found his recollection to be lucid, and his report credible.There are several reports of sasquatches using human structures as shelters. Similarly, there are reports of sasquatches frequenting particular homesteads as well. After talking with the witness, I feel that this is one of those cases. Long-term cases usually consist of a great deal of subtle signs of their presence, but only a few, if any, actual encounters.",
