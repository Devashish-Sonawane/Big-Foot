            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness, JG, is my 14-year-old nephew and after I interviewed him he had these details to add\u0085-JG, 12 years old at the time, and two friends, a 13-year-old and his younger brother, were playing in the woods near his house. The woods border a large conservation area and are comprised of swamp, oak forests and piney shrub land. -While playing and making the usual sorts of \u0091boyish ruckus\u0092 noises, the boys heard sticks breaking and the sounds of something large approaching them through the thick undergrowth. -Feeling apprehensive, the two older boys began to move slowly back towards the house, while the youngest boy ran home.-JG reported that at this point he turned around and saw something tall behind a tree. He exclaimed to his friend, \u0093What\u0092s that?\u0094 But the friend didn\u0092t look back, instead choosing to keep up his retreat.-JG states that what he saw was a \u0091man thing\u0092 that was peering from behind a large tree from about 25 feet away. He says that it was covered in hair and that most of its body was hidden behind the tree. He does not recall much about its body except that it was sort of \u0091humpbacked\u0092 and \u0091tall\u0092, much taller than his 6' foot tall father, and that it was definitely standing on two legs. -He stated that its head was \u0091sort of roundish\u0092 and that its head sat squarely on its shoulders. He only saw one shoulder, which he described as being \u0091huge\u0092 and \u0091really buff\u0092.-When asked about the hair, JG described it as being \u0091darkish brown\u0092 and that it appeared well groomed.-What JG recalls most vividly was the creature\u0092s face, particularly its eyes. He gave a detailed description of it having blackish lips, no ears, a \u0091sort of gorilla nose\u0092 and that the hair on its head was like a cross between \u0091people hair and animal hair\u0092. But when asked to draw a picture of what he had seen, JG only drew the eyes. He states that they were brown and piercing and that it is what he remembers most about the creature.-JG remembers the sighting as having taken place about 1pm and that it only lasted about 10 seconds, or less, before he also turned and ran.-Although the witness is my nephew, he had experienced this sighting long before I had started doing investigative work with the BFRO. JG is adamant about what he had seen and I believe that what he had witnessed was a bigfoot.As a side-note to this report, JG had recently had another possible encounter in July, 2008.-While riding his dirt bike around a dirt track that was carved out close to where the first encounter took place, JG thought he saw something \u0091large, black, hairy and on two legs, in his peripheral vision, running into the swamp. Not sure of what he had seen, he immediately reported the incident to his mother. -His mother, the author of this report, took her camera and went back into the swamp with her son to where he had spotted the creature. She stated adamantly that she was very cognizant about where they stepped and scanned the area carefully before progressing onward.-They found and photographed several \u0091possible\u0092 tracks of foot prints in the mush, between 12\u0094-14\u0094 long, as well as a possible hand impression. There were no identifiable details to the tracks and the tracks were not sequential, so there was no way to measure the stride.-What was interesting however, was that near the tracks, in a large patch of featureless mud, there was a freshly uprooted saw palmetto that had been moved, and then peeled apart with some of the ends seemingly chewed until the fibers were separated. The mud close to the palmetto leavings was such that it could not hold any viable tracks. When I visited the area my boots sunk so deep that my prints became mushy and indistinguishable. But the saw palmettos were freshly dropped and scattered about the area, something which none of the local fauna, except for a human, could have achieved, which is unlikely. A saw palmetto is extremely difficult to uproot, even with a shovel. And according to the author of the report, and the witness, nobody that they knew of had been back in this particular area for some time due to the mucky conditions and because of the thick mosquito population. And as far as the possibilities of someone trespassing through there, it is highly unlikely because of the sheer difficulty of trudging through that area when they could just as easily have traveresed the motorcycle track, only about 20' away, or have gone further East, which is higher ground.See pictures below... 'Saw palmettos that had been recently pulled up, separated and scattered about.' 'One of the bulbs, 'the edible part of the saw palmetto' that was found separated from the main husk.' 'One of the bulb ends that appeared to have been chewed.' 'A possible print.'The area near JG\u0092s house borders the Cypress Creek Well Field, part of the Southwest Florida Water Management District, which includes around 7,400 acres of wetlands, forests and plains. Although there are trails open to the public, much of it is inaccessible because of its rough terrain. It is also part of an established natural corridor that extends for hundreds of miles throughout the state of Florida and is known to have other reported sightings.Report #15361 occurred during the same year and in the same area.",

As we approached the straight stretch, just before you reach the town of Quitman, we saw a creature walk from the bushes on the right side of the highway onto the road.
