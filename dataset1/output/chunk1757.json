I went outside thinking I was going to hear the nearby bulls, dogs, or even a coyote.   What I heard was the strangest sound I had ever heard.  We stood there for quite a while trying to figure out what it could be until my five year old started crying saying he was scared.",

She was adamant that what they heard was exactly like the whoop-howl vocalizations recorded in the Gifford-Pinchot National Forest in March 2005. She and her sons listened to the strange vocalizations for approximately ten minutes. The witness estimated that the sounds originated from a position of no more than 100 yards into the woods behind her property. She said that the vocalizations were very clear and loud. She said it wasn't until she was able to listen to whoops on the BFRO site that she was able to find something that matched what she heard. As she and her sons listened, the youngest boy finally began to cry, and told his mother that he was scared. The witness told me that she plans on recording the sounds should she hear them again. ",
