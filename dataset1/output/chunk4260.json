It was steaming as if it had been running.\" He described it as being covered with black hair and very muscular. He later checked an encyclopedia and found the creature he'd seen resembled an orangutang, except in size and color. He also said several people were able to train spotlights on the creature for some time. He said he recorded the being's yell note once. Cooper described it as \"very powerful\" and high pitched. The creature loped alongside his car, which was traveling about 10 miles an hour, he said.",
