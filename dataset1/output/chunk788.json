            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness, M.S. and we went to the location of the sighting.  After mapping the location and speaking with the witness I concluded that M.S. is a credible observer, but there is still uncertainty about what he saw.  This report is posted in case others in the area have seen a white haired bigfoot. Bigfoots with white hair are spotted occasionally in various states.  _______________________Editor's note (MM):The reported hair color of bigfoots spans the range of human hair color:  Red, blond, brown, black, gray, and white.  The variance of hair color is thought to be more due to individual variation, and age variation, rather than regional variation. Some credible witnesses who have seen more than one individual during the same incident, reported a distinct variation in hair color between individuals that were different sizes, and assumably different ages.  Human family groups often show different hair colors among individual family members of different sizes.________________________This area is made up of dense woods, rolling foothills, and streams.  There are caves in the general vicinity of the sighting.  MS described that he was riding bicycles from Pickens to his home early in the morning when he approached the intersection of Tabor Woods Road and Ireland Road.  MS stated that when he got to the intersection he looked to see if any cars were coming and didn't see anything.  He then turned around to let his companion know that the intersection was clear.  At this point he saw something going into the woods. His recollection was that it might have been a horse or something ghostlike based on the whitish/gray color. When he returned to the area, he saw that a horse could not have accessed this area due to the dense woods and the barbed wire fence.  M.S. ia an avid fisherman and related his experience in the outdoors.  He discussed incidents of fishing where bushes were shaken, but nothing observed to be causing the brush movement.  His wife and him spoke on an incident on Big Chatuga River while fishing where they felt uneasy and left the area.   There are other reports of sightings in this general area of upstate SC. These photographs were taken at the location of the sighting:",

He has been working several seasons doing Spotted Owl surveys and is very familiar with local wildlife. One evening just before sunset he and his partner were walking with a cage of six mice that had sat in the same cage without being cleaned for 3 or 4 days and it smelled to high hell. They were several miles south of Bald Hills Road at about 2,000 feet up an approximately 3,000 foot mountain in extremely rugged and isolated terrain several miles from the nearest logging road. After bushwhacking for about thirty minutes heading downhill they stopped in their tracks when they heard a large branch snap.  There are a lot of bears and mountain lions in the area and they are familiar with with stalking cats.  The creature was quick and agile like a cat but sounded heavier than a bear.  It also sounded like it was walking on two legs.  They would hear it behind them and a little later it would be way ahead of them, sometimes on the other side of them",
