Ive had others say..it could have been a cow..or a tree..and I say..does a cow stand upright alongside the road just chilling and watching...and how does a tree move from a field onto the edge of the roadway?",

The witness travels Greensburg Road for her daily commute and is very familiar with everything along her route.   While Greensburg road does travel just north of the Akron/Canton Regional Airport, her incident occurred further east in a more rural area, west of Alliance, OH.  The witness was traveling east on Greensburg en route to her residence when her headlights illuminated the figure standing just off the side of the road.  She instinctively slowed down.  The figure was to her right on the south side of the road.  The witness said, \"It looked like a big, huge, giant person.\" \"It had a head, big arms and lots of hair.\"  The witness also said, \"I felt like it was staring at me.\"  The witness added that she was overcome with a feeling of she had to get past this thing so she sped up and moved on.  After she was clear, the witness said she became very emotional and had to find a spot that she could pull over to call her daughter and recount what she had just experienced.The witness is a lifelong resident of the area and has spent the last 25 years in her current residence.  I found her to be credible and sincere in her accounts.  Though it was dark and her encounter brief she is convinced she saw a Bigfoot and says she never wants to see another one.  ",
