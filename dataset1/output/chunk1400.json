            "Observed": "My wife and I were new to the area so we decided to check out Frozen Head State Park.  We drove there in the early afternoon and decided to try to walk one or two of the trails in the park.  We took our two dogs with us as they love to hike, and if no one else is near us, we let them off leash so they can run up and down the trail.  Today was different.  The dogs never got more than a couple of yards from us and seemed stressed.  We thought their conduct was odd, but credited their behavior to the fact that they had not been out much since we just moved.   We started along the Interpretive Trail loop near the Old Mac Trail head.  We were enjoying ourselves as there was no one else on the trail.  We stopped next to a creek and I thought I heard a single knock, like someone hitting a bat against a tree.  I asked my wife if she heard it and she confirmed she heard the noise as well.  We thought maybe it came from hikers up ahead.  We walked along a little farther and heard what sounded like a tree fall in the distance behind us.  There was a little wind, and we have heard trees fall in the woods before, so we continued walking thinking nothing of it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness and found him to be a detailed witness of credibility. He is a pastor in a local parish. He recapped his report noting again how his dogs were spooked, as well as his wife, when they were hiking. They heard knocks, a tree break, and found a footprint in the mud/dirt that was much bigger than his size 14 shoes. I reviewed the pictures of the print that he submitted, with him, and he noted he tried to make an imprint in the ground next to the print, but could not, even though he weighs close to 300 pounds himself. The picture of the print shows a big toe, and possibly smaller ones also. See photos:I visited the trail in Frozen Head State park, and found the Interpretive Trail loop, near the Old Mac trail, as he described. It rained intensely, so I will revisit the site, another day.I noted to the witness that the show, Finding Bigfoot had visited the Frozen Head Park area and had activity.The report he mentions above is BFRO Report #31005 ",

I saw it clearly crossing the road right in front of me, I'm 6'4\" so is my brother n law this creature was considerably taller than me probably 6'8\" shuffling like an orangutan but more human-like but not like a man. It was covered in long hair maybe 4-6 inches long. It was not walking but not running... quickly shuffling. The most distinguishing feature was its arms, slump shouldered and its hands were below its knees. Now here is the deal, I don't drink I don't do drugs, I'm 55 yrs old as of May this year, have three grandbabies and two sons. I'm a christian and have NEVER, EVER, believed in bigfoot. I don't know what this was but i do know this.... it was NOT human, no costume but not 100 percent animal. I SAW IT CLEARLY MYSELF.  Please take this seriously! I don't care if you contact me personally or not but please check this thing out there is something out there i saw it myself. Is it \"bigfoot\" I've no idea but its something... thank you for your time",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was coming home around 7:45 pm from a Little League game. He had just dropped his grandson off a few minutes before coming across a 6\u00928\u0094 or better creature crossing the road ahead of him. The creature had just dropped down to the roadway from a 10 ft. hill. This black/gray colored animal was covered in 6-8 \u0093hair much like an orangutan\". The creature did not appear to even notice him as it shuffled across the gravel road. The muscles could be seen to flex as the creature moved quickly across the road heading for a swamp. The swamp area has been a source of creature sightings across the years, according to the local sheriff\u0092s office. The witness is a business man in the area and was afraid to come forth with his observation for some time. He explained that it was at least three restless, sleepless nights before he could wrap his head around what he had seen. He is an avid hunter who spends a considerable amount of time in the forest. While sitting in his tree stand and hunting blind he has heard screams that are unfamiliar to him. He has since set out trail cams, but so far has had no luck. ",
