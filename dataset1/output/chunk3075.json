            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness over the phone. The witness observed a large, 7 foot bipedal figure cross the road in front of his van. From his vantage point behind the wheel of his vehicle, the witness stated the top of the figures head appeared to be 3 feet higher than the roof of a car traveling roughly 25-30 feet in front of him, going in the same direction. The figure moved from south east to north west, coming from the Bear Swamp Wildlife Management area, across the road and up a mountain embankment, towards the Appalachian Trail. The witness described the creature's head as human-like with glaring eyes and it had long arms swinging back and forth. The witness could not recall facial features. After passing the creature, the witness made a U turn and he and a fellow counselor exited the vehicle in an attempt to locate the Bigfoot. The witness claims he grabbed a road flare and searched for the creature, but he could see no Bigfoot, he only heard the crashing and breaking of branches as if something big was maneuvering through the brush and up the steep mountainside. The witness was with 4 other counselors who claim to have also witnessed the event. I was unable to interview the other witnesses. NOTE: This witness appeared on the Northern New Jersey Finding Bigfoot episode, which reenacted his story on site. During the reenactment, the witness claimed he used a road flare as a flash light to try and see the creature. In his initial report to the BFRO, he states he used a flash light. When I questioned the witness, he stated he couldn't remember the exact details.",
