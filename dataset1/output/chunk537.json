            "Observed": "I was kayaking with a friend in econlockhatchie river in orange county the east side of orlando fl it was 2003 early spring or very late winter my friend was much slower than me so I was having fun suprising these very large alligators that were sunning them selves in the early morning sun.The river is very narrow and has tight winding corners which allowed me to pop around a corner and to my delight most of the time a huge gator would slip into the river silently I would glide over the spot thinking that gator has to be lurking on the bottom.Anyway The wind was light out the west very dry and cool a real treat for a floridian I paddled a ways on a strait with the wind blowing from the woods to the water when I smelled such a strong overwhelming oder musty thick moist pugent smell I never experienced before I looked to see what on eart could it be when I saw big patch of long flowing fur it was shiny and light brown and moving fast then this animal crashed through the woods with so much force that small trees were popping and snapping as it ran away from me and the river then that smell was lingreing over the area and was so strong I finnaly held my breath and had paddle to get some fresh air.I had heard that bigfoot smelled like that but I had no idea they had been reported in fl.Anyway I had watched monster quest for years and not one person ever mentioned the smell I only remember it from seventies on tv when i was very young I never reported this til now because I felt  stupid and confused then after watching tonights episode where 2 different reports described that same smell I felt compelled also the location seemed very odd orlando fl just seemed too odd but internet searches showed many reports",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness, GF, over the phone and he was more than willing to share his experience with me. As stated in his report he was kayaking with a friend on the Econlockhatchee River. Leaving the friend far behind, GF was silently drifting towards a bank just before a sharp turn in the river when he felt a small gust of wind on his face. \u0093The smell hit me right then.\u0094 Exclaimed GF. \u0093It was the most rankest, putrid odor I had ever smelled! It was so thick and pungent that I felt like I was choking. I gasped in a breath and let out an expletive when suddenly I saw something in the brush ahead of me. It looked sort of like a 3-foot wide piece of reddish-brown carpet rising up through the weeds. It just kept rising and rising until it was about 8 foot in the air, and then it turned to the left and ran!\u0094\u0093I couldn\u0092t see it completely because of the dense woods around it. All I could see was that it was about 3-foot wide and very muscular. When it ran, it ran fast and smooth, way faster than a man could run. Even a linebacker couldn\u0092t have run that fast, especially through all of the thick growth. I could even see the tops of trees shaking when it ran.\u0094He stated that although he couldn\u0092t get a good look at the body shape he could see that it had long and shiny, but scraggly hair that moved as it ran. GF stated that he was approximately 6 feet away from the bank, and that the creature stood up about 8-10 feet away from the edge of the water. GF stated that when his friend finally caught up with him he didn\u0092t say anything about what he had seen. \u0093I really doubt that he would have believed me.\u0094The Econlockhatchee River flows through vast parcels of both state forests and wildlife preserves. Much of the river is comprised of undisturbed wetlands and hardwood forests and is home to numerous species of wildlife. ",
