            "Observed.1  ": "Deep in the northwest mountains, a team of 14 researchers tracked the elusive primate-type beast for a week deep in the mountains of the Gifford Pinchot national forest.  The imprint appears to be a hair-covered body lying down on its side, reaching over to get some fruit, the researchers said. Thermal imaging confirmed that the body print was only hours old.  From the imprint, they created a 250 lb. plaster cast of what they say is the lower half of the Sasquatch.  \"We actually almost missed it,\" said researcher Derek Randels. \"It dawned on us all at the same time, and it was overwhelming.\"  \"These heel impressions weren't made by a person getting in the mud wallow and squirming around,\" said Dr. Jeff Meldrum of Idaho State University.  The trackers gathered hair samples that will be analyzed by DNA testing. They also made voice recordings of what they think is the Sasquatch wailing, also being sent off for analysis.  The creature is believed to be 7 to 8 feet tall, weighing 800 to 1,000 lbs. The researchers believe there are hundreds just like it throughout forests in the Northwest.  There are a lot of sightings, they added, but estimate that more than 90 percent of sightings go unreported for fear of ridicule.  \"This cast is very hard to argue with,\" said Randels. \"We have had a lot of very intelligent people looking at it in the last two days and I think it's just going to be a heck of a shot in the arm for the credibility of the creature's existence.\" ",
