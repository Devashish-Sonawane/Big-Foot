I struck up a conversation with them and learned they were hunting guides. After a while, I casually (I thought) asked if they had ever heard of anything unusual in the area. Literally before the question was completed, they started talking to each other in Spanish and then said, \u0093Bigfoot?\u0094 They told me that an acquaintance of theirs, a fellow guide who they described as very experienced, had a sighting. However, they both said they would have to see one first themselves before they could really believe his story.",
