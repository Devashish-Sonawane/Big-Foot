            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone and found her to be very enthusiastic and credible. She had taken her daughter into town to attend a field trip, and was on the road earlier than usual. She first saw the animal at about fifty yards, but by the time she stopped she was \"close enough it could have touched the car\".   She described it as being very broad and looking like a no-neck football player wearing shoulder pads. The skin was black covered with  dark brown to black hair, about two inches long, and neat though full of weeds. It had a human-like face with a heavy brow, dark eyes and narrow lips.  The creature's noticeably large hand grasping an ear of corn and the direct eye contact were the two most impressive recollections of this sighting. Although no tracks were found she has seen unidentified prints and heard howls and apparent woodknocks in this area in the past.  Her experience as a kid involved possible tracks, she did not get a good look at what made them. I asked the witness to send us one of her drawings, if she does, I will update this report.The drawing has not been received as of 04/20/10.",

            "Observed": "We decided to take a walk upstream, where the creek was narrow and rounded a bend away from camp. We got about 1/4 mile from camp and noticed rustling sounds in the bushes directly across the creek from us, maybe 40-50 feet away. We kept walking upstream, pausing a few times to listen, each time still hearing the rustling. As we kept walking and trying to see what was making the sounds, we realized whatever it was, was keeping pace with us across the creek. Then we noticed a face peering through an opening in the bushes. It was mostly covered in reddish-brown shaggy hair. The eyes were a golden brown color. The sun was dappled through the branches over head, but light enough to really see it looking back at us. We kept walking another 100 yards or so, with the sasquatch peeking through the bushes maybe 2 more times. ABout then we all looked at each other and remembered that the creek ended upstream in a swampy area and we would be face to face with it if we kept going. Also the realization that we were being paced by a huge seemingly sentient creature panicked us, and we ran back to camp, fast. We told our parents, who took us pretty seriously. I remember reading about other sightings in the area that same weekend, whne we got home from camping. We didn't see or hear anything else that weekend, but we were too scared to go far from camp after that.",
