            "Observed": "In June of 2012 my son woke me up at approximately 3 am telling me that he heard whispering somewhere around the house. I told him to go back to bed because he was dreaming. within minutes I heard the whispering as well. I grabbed a flashlight and left my bedroom which is on the second floor of my house. My son immediately asked me if I heard the whispering as well. The \"whispering\" sounded like someone was whispering loudly and it sounded like a foreign language or gibberish of some sort. I first thought that is was outside in my back yard but wanted to clear my house first to be sure someone wasn't in my home. shortly after looking around my house I the whispering stopped. five or six days later  on July 4th I was in my back yard getting ready to cut the grass when I noticed the area of my yard where the grass was higher was trampled down and there was a feces pile in the grass. I have seen scat from most all of the animals in my area and this didn't appear to come from any of them. It was very large, black and looked like it came from a human. my first thought was that someone took a crap in my yard. I then called my son to come take a look and he reminded me of the whispering that had taken place days earlier.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After conducting an interview with the witness I found him to be forthcoming and credible. The witness is a former military veteran who currently resides next to the Joint Base Lewis-McChord military installation at North Fort.The incident site is located in a small neighborhood of houses surrounded by forest land and swampy area. It is located next to a military base, most of the land and surrounding area is closed to the public and patrolled regularly by military security.The witness told of waking up in the middle of the night by his older teenage son and being told loud whispers were being heard outside. The witness then heard the whispers and checked the house first and then the outside area. He did not find anything and the whispering stopped after that.Witness stated that the sounds were similar to English but the words were unrecognizable and gibberish-like. About 4 days later the witness noticed a trampled down area of high grass and a large pile of feces in the middle. After questioning him he said that he thinks something had just walked through the grass and that it was not a bedding area. In April of 2015 in the early morning he took his dog out and heard approximately 3 extremely loud wood knocks across the road from his residence. The knocks were slow and evenly spaced. The witness became uneasy and returned to the house.The witness also told of an incident in which his daughter and boyfriend experienced large rocks being thrown into a swamp-like area while out walking in the early evening. They became frightened and ran back home.These incidents all occurred within an area of swamp and forest land surrounding a closed and sparsely populated area. There are plenty of areas of concealment and cover. The area is lush with wildlife and water. These are the type of environments that are consistent with Bigfoot experiences. ",
