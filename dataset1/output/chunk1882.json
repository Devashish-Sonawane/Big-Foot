At first glance I thought it was a person because it stood upright and walked on two legs however as it stode acroos the highway its gate was slightly hurried and it only took two massive strides to reach the other side of the road. The shape was like a human however it was extreamly tall approx. 8 to eight and a half feet due to the limited light cast by my headlights I could only see a large dark shape and little or no features.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness some additional details should be added.When this sighting occurred it was approximately five degrees outside at an elevation of 4000 feet. She thought the creature was a person at first sight when it stood up and crossed the highway, but when it crossed a two lane highway in two strides smoothly and with no effort; seemingly impossible for a human since each stride was a least ten feet long from a standing position. She also noticed the size - very tall with very long arms that swung as the creature moved, and it appeared to be dark brown or black in color. After the creature crossed the highway it disappeared down a hill where the witness' house is located with only five or six other houses at the bottom the same hill. She informed her neighbors of her sighting, but none of them had seen or heard anything. However, the witness' daughter was woken up in the middle of the night by something screaming outside of her window a couple weeks after their experience.",
