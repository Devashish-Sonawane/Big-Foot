            "Observed": "We were on a family hike in the Ventana Wilderness area, south West of the dam.  We had been climbing pretty steadily and were walking along a ridgeline, next to a densely forested downhill.  My sixteen year old son was leading, about 20 yds ahead.  I heard him let out a scream and immediately ran to see what was wrong.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After interviewing the secondary witness, who is the father of the primary witness and a current CIO for the United States Army, the following details emerged:The incident took place on the eastside of the coastal mountains in the northern part of the Ventana Wilderness in Monterey County. This area is directly southwest of the Las Padres Dam located in Carmel Valley. The landscape consists of many hills layered with thick, almost impenetrable brush with sprinkled Monterey Pine and Oak trees. It\u0092s extremely desolate with sporadic residences off of the main road. \t The father was taking his family on a casual day hike when the encounter took place where the trail leveled off slightly. They had been walking a ridgeline heading west next to a forested downhill containing very dense, dry brush. The father reacting to his son\u0092s screams, was briefly able to view what he described as a 6 to 61/2 foot tall, very dark, furry and bipedal blob disappear into thick brush downhill. The father\u0092s recollection was that the \u0093thing\u0094 crossed the path from north to south heading downhill. He emphasized hearing extremely loud crashing of brush as the subject and the shaken teenager swiftly distanced themselves from each other. Details from the primary witness:.The primary witness had gotten ahead of the rest of his family and came to a point where there was a clearing with a dry creek bed running through it. He noticed a large Oak tree across the small narrow clearing to his left about 10 to 20 feet away from him. The trail passed to the right of the tree and disappeared behind it into the forest again. As the witness rounded the tree he noticed a large dark shape immediately to the left approaching on an intersecting path from the brush behind the tree. He immediately reversed direction back towards his father who was directly 20 to 30 yards behind him. The subject passed close to where the witness had stood and continued on downhill into thick brush",

It was VERY quiet. usually we can hear coyotes or owls..this night nothing.  we saw what we thought was a person jogging up the road but realized it had to be at least 7-8 feet tall and was taking huge strides. it was covered with long reddish to blonde  hair and had long arms that swung as it walked.  it looked in neither direction, just straight ahead. it was out of site in about 7-10 seconds and the footfalls could be heard slightly .",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. She said the figure walked along the paved road in no particular hurry, and that the road gets nearly zero traffic at night, and maybe 6 cars all day long.Many witnesses, from various parts of the continent, have described seeing these animals walking along roads after dark. It makes sense because it's the path of least resistance. It would also be easy to hear cars coming and get off the road and into the brush before being illuminated by headlights. Other animals do this as well.This is relevant to bigfoot field research with respect to surveillance efforts. When looking for a pathway to set up a surveillance system, the best place to monitor may be a road instead of a trail or a field, especially in locations where walking the road makes it much easier to get from one place to another, such as from one valley to another via a mountain pass road, etc.",
