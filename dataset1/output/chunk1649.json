            "Observed": "It was July 17,2009 an evening i'll never forget.me and my older brother Michael were enjoying a night of fishing at a spot we frequented on many other occasions.the location was just west of the DAM at west branch reservoir on a secluded point that was only accessable by one road which was a dead end turn around where you have to park. our location was approximately 2.2 miles from the intersection of booth road and new milford road. it seemed to be a very peaceful night of fishing,the water was so calm and the air so still and quiet. after about an hour of letting our bait soak i decided to practice a little coyote/predator calling. its a perfect spot for predator calling because of the great distances the calls travel over the lake and beyond,you can really get some great responses from the local predators. I had a 4 inch speaker high in a tree connected to my mp3 player on full throttle volume playing the worlds best predator callers routines. i let this go on for about an hour and a half straight until we just couldnt handle the noise anymore.we sat very quietly in the dark for about 15 or 20 minutes when i told my brother i heard something coming through the woods in our direction.i just returned from a 19 month combat deployment in iraq and nobody was gonna sneak up on me anywhere,let alone in the forest at night. i listened for a few minutes longer and then hit my 30  million candle power spotlight in the direction of the noises. that's when it happened. a god awful daefening scream that was so unhumanly load and horribly frightening that it immediately put me into a state of absolute scared to death im gonna die if i dont get away from this wretched scream type state of panic. i hadnt felt this alarmed since fighting in iraq for my life. it was the first time i was actually scared in the woods anytime with a firearm at my side. for the last 2 and a half years ive been completely engulfed in the bigfoot researchers association. learning as much as i can about what had happened to us that night. I know one thing for sure,me and my brother were without a doubt approached by a very surprised ohio bigfoot. there is nothing in my 35 years of being in the woods and jungles that can even come remotely close to the absolute roaring scream of a sasquatch. this incident report is being wrote on my own free will and is the absolute truth of the events that took place that muggy june night.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness in a telephone interview and can include additional information.  Prior to the encounter, the witness had an interest and curiosity about the existence of Sasquatch but was not completely convinced of the creatures existence.  The predator calls he was blasting were intended to just see what animal might respond.   I personally have conducted some research in this vicinity and can attest that sound will carry and reverberate for a good distance. The brothers are avid outdoors men and consider themselves capable of being trackers or acting as guides for various hunts.  I questioned the witness if any animal responded to the calls and he answered that nothing responded and in fact it was very quiet.  The only thing they observed was a few deer that got close to their position, but moved on.  The witness could not recall an exact time, but it was after the deer could no longer be heard or observed that he heard the sounds of footsteps coming closer to their position.  In speaking with both the witness and his brother, they both thought that it was a game warden approaching their position, but that did not make any sense to them as there wasn't any signs of a flashlight just the subtle sounds of someone approaching them.  The witness was keenly alert for something like this given his recent military experience.  The brother told me that the witness was part of a rapid response unit that supplied rapid reinforcement to any unit that was under fire and that he was not given to exaggeration.   The witness continued to think that maybe it was a game warden after all and decided to light up the area.  The erupting roar that ensued was not what he was expecting.  In questioning the witness further, he said that he couldn't make out any shape but could detect some kind of movement at about 20 to 30 yards.  According to the witness, the sound was deafening and he could feel the vibrations of the noise.  The witness added that he drew his weapon as he didn't know of any animal that could make a sound like that and he expected the worse at any moment.  I asked if he remembered any other noise or odors and he recalled that he did hear what he thought might have been branches breaking, but it was in a different direction from where the roar was coming from.  According to the witness, he did not look in the direction of the breaking sounds.  He retained focus on the area in front of him.  He added that his brother was gathering up their gear and he was going to cover their exit.  He admitted to being very intimidated and desired to leave the area immediately.   In a subsequent interview with the witness, it was determined that one of the calls that was played was the sound of a rabbit in distress.  This could possibly account for why something was drawn to the position of the witness.  In all of our conversations, I found the witness to be consistent and sincere in his disclosures.  His experience and reaction is consistent and similar in nature to other reports that I have investigated.  The witness is convinced that he had an encounter with a Sasquatch.  Prior to the event, his brother was a skeptic, but is currently reevaluating his opinion.",

            "Observed": "My friend  lives outside of Cardington. It was about 6:00 P.M. when I got to his house and we decided to build a small camp fire just for the sake of fun. He lives right next to a small wooded cliff that follows a tiny  river. Right behind his house next to the cliff that leads into the small woods is his security light that stays on all night. It was about 9:40 P.M. that night and we had a really good camp fire going when he said \u0093we are just about out of wood\u0085 do you think you could take the flash light and pick up some small twigs to keep this fire going.\u0094 At the time I really didn\u0092t think anything of it and being a hunter and all I\u0092m not scared of going into a woods at night. So, I said \u0093sure\u0094 and took the flash-light and proceeded down a cut path on the face of the hilly cliff. The first step I took heading down that hill I will never forget for the rest of my life. As I took my first step onto the path I saw a massive black object/thing at the bottom of the cliff in a wall of weeds taller than me. Now, I\u0092m about 6\u0092 1\u0094 and this black thing was a good 8 feet in height or taller. The weeds at the bottom were it stood are a good 7\u0092 in height or longer themselves. With said, I just stood there froze in fear asking the same question in my head \u0091what the hell is it?\u0092",
