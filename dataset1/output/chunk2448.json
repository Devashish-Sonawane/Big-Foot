            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness on 10/22/2012. I will add a few minor details not put in initial report. The tree line is on a ridge above where he and the other witness were walking. It slopes up and away from the path, and then back down and towards the path. He exchanged whistles 6-7 times and all whistles were virtually identical to his. Single whistle answered with single, double answered with double. There were no other additions to the story other than the above. He is not aware of any other stories or rumors concerning creature sightings in the area.Paralleling by something or someone unseen is commonly reported on expeditions and in areas with a history of bigfoot activity, as well as human-like whistles.Added comments from witness: On 12/26/2012 witness answered my follow up question as to whether he had caught any fish. He had not caught any fish, but had a cooler with very stinky catfish bloodbait. This could be one explanation as to why he may have been followed, creature thinking there was some fresh caught fish to be had.  Witness also added that the area is a wooded area and probably has abundant wildlife, but he was not paying attention to that and he had actually not been to this particular spot before.Update 9/2/17. County is either Pottawatomie or Riley, most likely Riley. CB",

            "Observed": "i was sitting on the river back just a mile from my house. it was early evening as i was sitting there i heard some rustling in the trees behind me never thought anything about it, figured it was a deer or something. this went on for prob 10 or 15 minutes.. then all of the sudden the wind shifted and i got a whiff of the most awful disgusting smell ive ever smelt like wet dog and sewarge mixed. it was awful never smelled anything like it. honestly didnt give much thought but the smell kept getting stronger and the rustling got louder. i turned around and there 20 30 yards in front of me stood a huge creature at least 8 9 feet tall broad as a grizzly.  it was a very dingy brown color very deep sunken eyes. it never moved a made a sound or anything. It just looked at me i dropped my pole and ran to my car prob 1/2 mile away and went to the house in a hurry. my mom lived next door and saw me speed home came to ask what happened. She said i was white as a sheet and couldnt talk for several  minutes... i remember being terrified, confused why it didnt chase me or attack me or nothing. i never looked back when i was running just kept moving. to this day i have not been to that spot.  the other encounter of the smell was prob a mile from the original place.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with the witness via phone. I am familiar with the area since it is about 45 miles north of my home. We could not visit the site due to heavy flooding and continued rain. Buchanan County is full of lush farmland, tributary creeks, and the Platte River is one of the longest in the country. This witness originally filed this report 16 years ago and it fell through the cracks. At the urging of his brother, a policeman in N. Carolina, he re-filed the report. After speaking with him the report remains pretty short and straightforward. It was early evening on June 8th, 1996. He heard the rustling behind him for about 15 minutes, and as stated, paid it no mind, as he figured it was a deer, or perhaps another person coming in to fish. Where he was at was the best place to get down to the river. It was about 15-20 yards or so from Pigeon Creek, which feeds into the river. The creek has heavy vegetation and steep banks so access to the river there is difficult at best. Where he was, the bank has a gentle slope down to the river. If you stand up at the river bank there you are about a head taller than the level of the land above you which is about 5 feet.He heard the rustling and steps (no bi pedal noted) and then an overwhelming stench began wafting down to him. It seemed to be getting worse, and seemed to be getting closer. After about 15 minutes the smell was brutal and the rustling or steps stopped, and it seemed very close. He got a \u0093weird creepy feeling\u0094 and he turned around. There this massive \u0093dingy brown creature\u0094 just standing perfectly still and staring right at him. A \u0093man with a whole lotta hair\u0094 as he put it more succinctly. It was 20-30 yards away, and it was most of the way towards Pigeon Creek from his location. He estimated the weight to be 700-800 lbs. at least. The eyes were \u0093black and empty looking\u0094 and they were \u0093looking right through him\u0094 and it never blinked. The stare down lasted 5-7 seconds but felt like an hour. He dropped his pole while they continued to look at each other, and he took a couple of steps towards the small trail. Creature didn\u0092t move. Stood like a statue. This was his chance to bolt and run, which he did. He heard no movement behind him, other than himself crashing through the underbrush. Left all his gear behind and ran appx. a half mile or so to where his car was parked and headed home. As he mentioned, the creature never followed or came after him. This was an assumption because he got out of there unscathed, and he also never looked back. He has never returned to that spot. We discussed going back there, and he is not certain that is a possibility. Plenty of other good places to fish. Witness was good and recollection was vivid, even though time has passed. He was truly frightened and affected by the event. And he cares not if anyone believes him or not. It happened and so be it. And he would not have even relived this event were it not for his family, urging him to come forward.",
