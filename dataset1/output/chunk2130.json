I have been a country girl all my life and have spent my life close to the land.  I had always been drawn to the forest and had slept outside when ever possible.  The weekends were made for pitching camp and swiming in the Rattlesnake Creek that runs along the foot of the property.  This time I wanted to spend the night along the side of the river by the deep pool we always swam in. The river has giant boulders to lay on and bask in the sun.  Both sides of the river are steep one side one side is so steep and gravel like you cant even climb it.",

Witness has heard faint calls, but has not seen anything like footprints.",
