            "Follow-Up Report": " I found the witness to be cooperative and sincere during the interview.The witness was riding on a mountain bike trail in a remote part of the San Felasco Hammock Preserve northwest of Gainesville, Florida. The trail passed through woods, pine forest, and prairie with four-foot tall grass in some places. It had rained a day or two before and the ground covering was still moist.She had just ridden a section that climbed up a hill and wanted to rest. She pulled off into a small circle clear of brush by a tree next to the trail so she would not block it. She looked down and spotted large barefoot tracks sunk 1/2\" into the ground. The prints were in a 6' x 7' cluster next to the tree. It looked like something had come out of the brush, rested by the tree, and then went around it back into the brush. The longest stride was approximately 36\".  The tracks looked about a day old. The witness estimated they were 17\" long by using her size 8 \u00bd shoe and sunglasses as a comparison. She could see toe impressions with none of the telltale signs that \"footy\" sneakers leave behind. It struck the witness as curious that someone with bare feet would choose to walk through the brush instead of using the trail. The witness also heard a thumping sound during this time. She was focused on the tracks and didn't pay attention thinking it was just hogs rutting the ground. Since then, she realized the sound was of something hitting the ground, not digging it up. The San Felasco Hammock Preserve covers 7,000 acres with a wide variety of habitats and elevations. There are areas of pine, forest, swamp, marshes and sand hill. Only the northern third of the preserve is open to bikes and horses. The remaining two thirds is limited to hiking only. A power line right-of-way cuts through the middle.There is an abundant supply of fresh water from ponds, lakes, steep head springs, and three creeks that flow into the park. Black bear have been seen along with deer, hog, and coyote.Development  has begun to isolate the preserve, but there is still enough coverage to move east to more rural areas if the traveler is careful. Photos the witness took of the prints:The witness agreed to meet Investigator R. Monteith and myself at the preserve to show us the location of the prints. One section of the trail is on a ridge that overlooks open fields with winding paths for both bikes and horses. We saw many deer grazing with little fear of people. Photo taken of the trail:",

An old friend of mine moved to Gold Beach, Oregon, and I was driving up to see him.  I had never been on Hwy. 101 before, and became nervous driving on the two lane winding roads.  I kept pulling over to let cars in back of me pass.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Mr. H.K. called me tonight and we discussed his close encounter, with what he now believes was a sasquatch, that was only five to ten feet away from the open window of the passenger side door of his Honda CRV.  Mr. H.K. is from a highly populated area on the East Coast, and he has never considered the existence of a sasquatch.  He went from a total nonbeliever to a believer because of this close encounter and is still reeling from that incident today. This occurred on the twentieth of September 2003 at approx. 1:30 p.m. about seven miles north of Klamath Ca., north bound on Hwy. 101.Mr. H.K. pulled over on a wide spot off of a two-lane section of Hwy 101. Of note: This was not a regular pull off area of that highway, and his right side wheels were off of the roadway next to some brush and grass.  He did this to allow faster moving vehicles to pass him.  As his vehicle came to a stop, the creature stood up between five and ten feet from his open passenger window and screamed, per Mr. H.K., \u0093loud enough to be heard over a mile away.\u0094 He said \u0093the first thing he did was to lie down across the front seat, and he also started to scream.  He then sat back up to observe the creature.\" At that moment, he said that he was \u0093scared out of his mind and thought he was going to have a heart attack.\u0094According to Mr. H. K, the sound emanating from the creature was like nothing that that he had ever heard before. The volume was the loudest thing that he had ever heard.  H.K. described the warbling screaming sound, as \"a women being stabbed with a knife in the rear. combined with a whistling parrot sound with a high and low frequency that vibrated his body and soul.\"  The noises were all integrated and seemed to be taking place at the same time. The vocalization lasted the entirety of the 5-6 second encounter.  The  creature took two large steps toward the large redwood trees, located approximately 15-20 feet from the paved road,  made a semicircle around the nearest tree, and then disappeared.H.K. only saw the upper body, because of the high brush and the vehicle door blocking his view.  It was facing away from him, H.K. said, \u0093that he was facing north, and the creature was facing southeast, so he could only see the right back area of it.\u0094 He did not see any facial features or its hands. Mr. H.K. described the creature as having very dirty and matted dark brown, dull hair.  He described the head as having a definite \u0093wedge\u0094 on top, and having no neck. He further stated that the back of it had well defined muscles \u0093like Mike Tyson\u0094.  He thinks that the creature stood about six and one half to seven feet tall, and weighed over three hundred pounds.  He could not ascertain its gender, and he never made eye contact with it. H.K. never checked for footprints, and stated he never wants to use this highway again. He stated his only thoughts after the incident, was how he was going to call 911 for his heart attack.In Summary: I believe that Mr. H.K. had a very close encounter with a sasquatch creature.  The sight of it didn\u0092t bother him as much as the screaming vocalization. The only person he has talked to about this situation is the BFRO, and he wants to keep it that way.  Mr. H.K. has never ventured into the wilds, and now never wants to.  He stated, that the creature reminded him of a gorilla, and if he saw one in a zoo, he would just pass it by for something more interesting. H.K. is still shaken up over this encounter, especially over the screaming sounds, and is having a difficult time trying to sleep at night.  The one good thing that has come out of this incident is that he has gone to church for the first time in thirty-seven years. P.S. Update:  Mr. H.K. found a similar sound wave on our sound site. Name of the scream is klwav1.wav, but his scream was fifty times louder.  Also, making a correction on the date, by one day.  The encounter took place on the 19th not the 20th.",
