It wasnt a person because of its height.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On 1/24/2013 I spoke with Jeremiah. As he stated in his report he was a passenger with his mother, who was driving north on Eagle Road which is on the outskirts of Biron, Wisconsin, and close to the Wisconsin River.  Google map of the area:View Larger MapThe surrounding area is wooded.  They were passing a newly constructed storage facility when Jeremiah clearly observed a large, shadow-like object which appeared to be lighter in color than nighttime darkness quickly move between the buildings and in the same direction that Jeremiah was traveling - north to south. Close-up satellite image of the location:There were a couple of street lights which provided enough illumination for Jeremiah to determine that the shadow seemed to be brown in color, and was approximately eight feet tall when using the storage facilities to gauge height.  Also, he clearly remembers seeing that while it was walking upright that it didn't have the same stride as a person walking.  It was a fast, smooth stride, and he also remembers seeing the left arm swinging as the creature was striding.  He asked his mother to slow down in order to see if the creature came out around the other side of the facility, but it never did.Jeremiah lives about a mile from the facility and in late summer/early fall 2012 he has reported hearing distant howls and wood knocks in the vicinity. See report #38662 .I found Jeremiah to be a very credible witness who never varied from his story.  At no time did he embellish his report or waiver from what he initially reported.Wood County is in the central part of Wisconsin.  As of the census of 2000, there were 75,555 people residing in the county. The population density was 95 people per square mile (37/km\u00b2). The lumber industry is still a major employer in Wood County.  The northern two-thirds of the county is largely covered in drift from early ice sheets. There are no lakes and few swamps.",
