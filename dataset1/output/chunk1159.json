At that time we lived north of Miami and would drive out SR 820 to US 27 to US 1 to get there.  After I got my own car and driver's license in the late 1960s I began making the trip down there ahead of the rest of the family usually leaving about 4am each Saturday.",

One was a LE friend who loved to hunt.  In South Florida the only hunting areas are the hammocks in the Glades.  He told me after one such incident he wasn't going back ever again.",

[BFRO Investigator Mike Aragona New Jersey]1/8/2008 6:00:06 PM Category Feedback on a posted Report Subject Artical # 1719 Comment I remember when this happened, I was around 9 my familyLived in Dade county in the 70's We live on Marine DriveMy Dad was in the Navy and was stationed at HomesteadNAS. I remember coming outside one night around maybe 7:30 Pm or 8:00 P.m And there was Dade county Sheriff cars riding around the neighborhood and helicopter's flying around. For 2 or three days. I remember hearing on the news that someone had hit \" A Skunk Ape\" not far from where we lived. And smashed up the car pretty good. There used to be an old fish hatchery at was abandoned right behind or house threw a short span of woods. I suppose the police where looking there the helicopter's where using spot-lights shining the woods.And the patrol cars where riding around.Shining there lights between the house's The woods at this time extended around the block from or house.I could see that the patrol cars where shining the woods There they had just started to build a subdivision at the time And there used to be dirt roads around this area.So they where driving around all over.I saw this report and decided to give my remembrance.JOE  ",
