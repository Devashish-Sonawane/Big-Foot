We stopped in our tracks.  About 25 to 50 yards ahead, it appeared from the woods on the right and ran across the road into the woods on the left.  It was completely white and must have been about 7 feet tall.  We then heard it coming towards us in the woods so we ran.  My friend was so scared he was crying.  We ran into a park officer who didn't believe us and told us to go home.",
