            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness at length over the phone.  His report was very thorough and full of detail.  The sounds are ongoing.   The witness did want to amend his statement to say that he saw it during the late fall.  He says that because he remembers the leaves being off of the trees.  The witness also added that he thought the hair was dark brown or black as seen in the light available. The creature walked by without acknowledging the presence of a human watching him, \u0093as if it didn\u0092t care if I was there or not\u0094. When asked what made him decide to go ahead and make the report, he said because it came back this year.  He has not seen it this year, but the howls and moans have started back up.  He did not make a report last year or talked about it, because he wants to keep his privacy.  Due to the sighting, the smell, the sounds, the reaction of the dogs, I believe that the witness has a seasonal visitor, if not two.  He is keeping a journal now with dates and observations.The witness is in the construction business.  He uses ratchet strap tie downs on his truck. One day he found a broken ratchet with a heavy yellow strap in his driveway.  This puzzled him because he does not use this type of strap.  He then found the rest of the strap near his garage in the woods.  Could this be a form of gifting?  The witness now knows when the creature is around by the way the animals act.  The neighbor\u0092s cows usually get nervous and stirred up prior to nights that he hears the howls.  One night he heard something running and stomping through the horse pasture.  He expected to see the horses running, but they were all standing still in the near corner away from the noise.  Of course, the dogs sometimes will stare into the woods for no particular reason.",
