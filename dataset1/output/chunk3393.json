The dog returned to camp unharmed, but was lying low for some period thereafter. During the second event, the witness was being followed unbeknownst to him by a reddish sasquatch (evidently an individual different from that seen the previous day), but it was seen by the little brother as they passed within about 30' of the campsite. The little brother was actually totally terrified to the point of tears of what he had seen.The third event consisted of ca. 5 branches thrown at the witness in about a 40' to 50' long arc, though he heard nothing else other than some minor growls out of the forest. Aside from that, he mentioned that he had often heard the sounds of wood being banged together in the forest. His grandmother told him that at one time when she was chopping wood (location unknown, but presumably in this general area), substantial rocks came flying out of the forest and damaged the roof of her house.",
