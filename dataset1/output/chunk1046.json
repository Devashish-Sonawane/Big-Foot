            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for quite some time six days after the sighting. I can add the following to the report:The witness, his 15 month old daughter, and a male friend were in the area to swim and fish. The terrain in the area is very heavily forested with a lot of old growth redwoods, oak, manzanita, and very dense fern growth. They had been at the location for approximately 20 minutes when he wandered off from the other two to look for lizards. It was at this point that he heard what he described as \"thumping\"; when he looked he saw the animal 100 feet up a hill from him. As the encounter began, the animal very slowly and slightly crouched down, as if to conceal itself. In front of the animal was some oak/manzanita scrub. It's left arm was positioned behind a large, upright boulder. The witness and the animal regarded one another for close to a minute and he was able to get a very good look at its features and anatomy.He describes the body hair as a reddish brown, long, and shaggy. There was matting in spots, particularly around the upper shoulder and head, though the arms seemed to be smooth and groomed. He noted debris in the body hair. He described the hair of the animals head as being \"like bad bedhead; like it has just woken up\". He also notes that the hair on the head was a darker brown than the body.  The eyes were \"three times as large as a human being's eyes\". He notes that they were an amber brown, with very little white at the edges. The nose was flat with large nostrils: \"a pig/monkey kind of nose\". He notes that the nostrils seemed very much set apart. The lips were very full and thick. He never saw gums, teeth, or a tongue. The ears stuck out a bit, but were fairly flat to the head. They had no hair on them, though they were the color of dirt. There was no hair on the nose or along the jawline. The hair on the face was \"patchy at best\". Around the eyes was a very light, fine gray hair. He reports seeing no neck: \"it was like the head just sat right on the shoulders\". The shoulders are described as being \"huge; very much like a football player with padding on, almost overly muscular like a professional body builder. He was able to see to the mid-chest area. The chest was \"definitely male, there were no female breasts\". The chest was lightly covered with hair and he could see a dirty reddish/peach colored skin tone underneath. He notes that the animal only blinked twice that he can recall during the entire encounter. The expression on its face at first was fairly benign, but as the time passed turned into a slight scowl, and the witness got the feeling that the animal didn't want him there. There were no noise or sounds made by the animal during the encounter. The witness finally turned and left the area and was then struck with a deep urge to leave the area. He took his daughter and friend and immediately drove away. He describes himself as being very emotional and the he \"cried most of the way home\", though he was not able to explain exactly why. The last statement the witness made to me that he felt important to the report was that \"this was a very, very beautiful animal\". The witness notes that the area, while remote, is popular with swimmers and fisherman. He has had two incidents in years passed near this area. One involving rocks being thrown at him and a few male friends. This incident involved a group of three men and two women camping in the area in 2007 over Labor Day. Around 11pm they heard something large splashing in the water, Shortly thereafter something began throwing pine cones into their camping area. They initially thought it was other campers playing a prank so they threw the pine cones back. This was returned by a 15lb rock being hurled at them. Their 95lb pit bull ran towards the \"thrower\" only to return a few seconds later, running into the truck and refusing to come out. It was at this time they they abandoned their campsite (gear and all) and left the area. When they returned to the location the next day, their tents had been messed up with some being knocked down. Their ice chest with all the meat and food in it was nowhere to be found but the witness' wallet with $150.00 in it was still there. ",
