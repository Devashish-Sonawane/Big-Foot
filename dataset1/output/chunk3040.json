            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness about his encounter and he went through the events as they happened to him.   I believe him to be very credible and completely sincere in his accounts.  He was not at all sure what he encountered at the time and told me he could not place the animal that made the sound.  His description of the sound to me was \"blood curdling, raspy, never varied in pitch\".  After this scream he heard another animal.  The other animal made a loud whistle and some very loud grunts.  He thinks it was communicating with the first animal.  He got his light out of his pack and shined it in the direction of the scream.  He saw eyes and the screaming continued.  The animal either blinked or turned because he then lost sight of the eyes.  He waited a few minutes, did not see or hear anything and continued down the trail.  He turned back and saw two sets of eyes on the other side of the large bank above him.  That was the end of his encounter.  The witness and I have been in contact since last spring and he has visited the site a few more times.  During one of his trips back he made a cast of the print that was left in the bank that he accidentally stepped in.  I hope to see this cast soon and hopefully visit the site this summer.",

At the time I didnt think a bigfoot would live around here and just went on my way.  It wasnt till i read the report of a sighting one mile from this location that I considered fileing this report.  one other detail the creases in the print looked the texture of a crumbled paper bag.not smooth. I would guess the sizes 8 and 10 (shoe size)  I ride alone alot and would rather not have bigfoot around here.",
