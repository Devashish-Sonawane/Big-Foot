Seen at dusk while riding on a fourwheeler trail to check a soybean field for deer. It looked at me and my brother (for what seemed like minutes but probably seconds, staring us in the eyes) overwhelmed with fear I geared down my fourwheeler. Looking down for a second to realize I was in neutral, as i looked back up trembling with fear he was almost out of sight running through the woods away from our direction. Nobody could have played a joke on us, it is private land and nobody knew we were going back there but the landowner that we told right before we drove back there.",

On the way back they took an ATV trail thru the woods on top a ridge. T. the passenger, notices a large figure on the left side of the trail. V. who was driving started to slow down and then to a stop less than 150 ft. away.V. and T. just stared at the figure while the figure stared back. In front of them stood a 7' or so tall white figure with very wide shoulders. It was white in color with long matted shaggy hair, somewhat how the hair of a dog can appear. A cone shaped head,  like a silver back gorilla with little to no facial hair and they did not notice any odd smells.The area is not well-populated and has plenty of cover and water sources.",
