            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was interviewed by phone and provided the following additional details.The incident took place on a track of private ranch land owned by the witness\u0092s family. The witness had walked from the family house approximately 0.5 mile down a small dirt road and had taken up a position just off the road and was facing an open pasture located on the other side of the road.  After 30-60 minutes in a sitting, stationary position and seeing no wildlife in the pasture, the witness first heard movement behind him deeper in the stand of large cedar trees and dense brush.  The witness was wearing a scent killer and recalled being upwind relative to the direction in which the initial movement was first heard.   He reported that as the animal approach closer it seemed to move back and forth.  After approximately 5 minutes of hearing movement, the animal suddenly exerted a single deafening scream of approximately 5-6 seconds in duration.  The witness described the scream as being somewhat hollow and monotone with no variation in pitch.  The witness remained stationary for 10-15 minutes after the hearing the howl, then returned to the road and walked quickly several hundred yards down the road to a nearby barn where a farm truck was parked.  He returned to the farmhouse in the truck.The witness has extensive hunting experience in the region and is very familiar with the sights and sounds of the indigenous wildlife in the area, including coyote, bobcats, and red wolf.  He was insistent that the sound he heard was not from any of these animals.  The terrain of this general area is comprised of large rocks, boulders, cliffs, steep hills and hard clay.  There are large stands of cedar breaks surrounded by dense brush as well as oaks and cottonwoods closer to the Brazos River.This incident took place within 0. 5 mile of report #8861 and in the general vicinity of report #14376.",
