            "Observed": "I was visiting my family\u0092s former home and treated myself with a night\u0092s stay at the cottages. They lie along the road running through from Deadwood to Rochford. The campground was empty save for me, even the proprietor was not home. They have beautiful pastures and a huge assortment of farm life - from turkeys to quail to goats and llamas donkeys and horses.  Their fields run right up to the forest, probably not even a football fields length away. I was sitting outside watching their antics and enjoying the evening air.  Suddenly, something started to howl in the woods to the west. Everything alive on the place froze in that same moment and all of their heads - mine included- swiveled toward the sound. I cannot begin to describe it, but I had grown up in these hills and know it was nothing I could identify.  The sound was somewhere between a howl and a scream and just echoed. It went on for 3-5 minutes, and every creature stopped to listen. I didn\u0092t hear it again while there. I didn\u0092t tell the proprietor when I saw him next. Since then, I\u0092ve listened to recordings to try and identify the sound and the recent recording by the hunter out of Canada is an exact match. That\u0092s what impelled me to report it.",

            "Observed": "One night about a year ago during fire season me my husband and three children took a drive at night to see what damaged accrued on the reservation. It was a clear night and so my 14 year old daughter and I got out to walk and to look for hot spots. Well we heard some loud grunts and we turned to look but it was hard to see so I had my husband turn the headlights on and we all saw three, very ugly hairy hairy people. One was about 7 to 8 foot, the other was about 7 ft but it wasn't as hairy and the little little one was about the size of a kid, age range from 7 to 9 years. Well the big one took its arm and raised it and did a half circle motion. It made the most fierce noise and we took off.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.She is unsure of the day in May, 2016.She is a former fire fighter and she went out around ten o' clock at night with her family to look for hot spots (smoldering areas) after a wildfire. They parked the car on the edge of the road. She was four feet off the road to kick dirt on a hot spot. Her daughter's dog was out with them and barked and growled at first. They heard grunts and a clicking, clucking mouth sound. She had her husband turn on the headlights that shown down the road and to the side where she was. Then stepping out from a cluster of burnt trees was a seven to eight foot tall figure. It stood about eleven feet away. It was dark brown to black with long woolly hair. Its body was \"built\" with arms longer than a person and a head that was twice the size of a person. She could not see a neck or facial features as hair was in the way. It reminded the witness of a horse's long mane hair over the eyes and face. This large figure made the vocalizations for two minutes until a second figure stepped out from the trees.This figure was a few inches shorter and its body frame was moderately stocky and not as big as the first one. It had dark brown hair like a shag carpet. Its head was similar in size to the first one. It had hair long enough to cover its face also. It also was making the clicking sound and was looking at the first one. The witness got the impression they were communicating. One minute later, a four and one half foot tall figure came out slowly and cautiously. It was thin with red-gold-brown hair. Although small, its head was the size of an adult person. The witness almost cried when it came out as she felt sorry for it being in the burnt area. She was not expecting to see any live animal. Then the largest figure made a half circle motion with its arm above its head. The witness said the hands were covered with hair. It made a sound that was difficult for the witness to describe, but like a loud roar that lasted less than one minute.When the family members that were outside went toward the car, the largest figure took three steps toward her. She is not sure, but believes it was now about eleven feet from the car. The other two figures went back into the charred trees. She was shocked at first, but now more calm and wanted to observe more. The other family members were extremely nervous and everyone left. The witness said the encounter lasted about ten minutes. She said the figures were not afraid of the car. She did not think they were protecting the young one, but were just wandering through the burnt area and wanted the people to leave. No odor was detected from the figures. The witness will be going back to observe the area as it regrows from the fire. ",
