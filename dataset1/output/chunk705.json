            "Observed": "During the autumn bowhunting season, in the fall of 1985, my friend, K, his cousin, T, and myself, A, went to K's parent's cabin (along with his parents).  We were all 15 to 16 at the time. The cabin is located north of Grantsburg, WI, on the edge of a very large wilderness area.  On Saturday evening, the moon was full so the three of us went out for a walk, down the long driveway through the forest and then for a mile or so down the paved road.  Early into the walk, we heard something moving in the bushes beside the road.  K thought it might be a bear and so we began to talk louder to scare it off. We all smelled something foul on the air, like rotten meat, sulfur, and musk all rolled into one.  I jokingly said that maybe it was Bigfoot, having read about it before.  The other guys laughed and we passed it off as a skunk, though it didn't quite smell as bad as a skunk. Several times during our walk (about a mile), we heard brush snap, and once water splashed as we passed a small pond (as if something was thrown into the pond).  At the time we were too engrossed in our conversation to fully pay attention to these seemingly isolated incidents, but putting them together now it appears as if we were being followed.  After about a mile, we all got a sort of creepy feeling, and decided to head back.  Just as we were getting back to the driveway of the cabin, the trees to the right of us started thrashing violently, as if a large man had grabbed them and was shaking them vigorously.  At that point we bolted for the cabin, running down the long dark driveway.  Once we were back at the cabin, we all attributed it to a bear.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "BFRO Investigator Patty Lee and I heard about these experiences at the Wisconsin Expedition recently, in person, from A and K.  We found A and K to be credible and very experienced with the Wisconsin wilderness. These Class B incidents happened approximately 150 miles from the 2006 Wisconsin BFRO expedition location.  [Futher editor comments]The eyes were described as \"glowing,\" not reflecting. The witnesses were looking out the window from a dark room. There was no light to reflect. Many witnesses describe \"glowing\" eyes, often reddish or orange in color, in the context of an encounter situation.  Readers and researchers often attribute these specific observations to reflections off the retina (in higher primates) or the tapetum lucidum (in other mammals). The \"glow\" may be only that.  It is important, however, to be aware that many credible witnesses are emphatic about seeing \"glowing\" eyes and not \"reflecting\" eyes. Many describe encounters in dark conditions where there is no  visible light source that can be reflected, only faint ambient light in the sky, which is not as bright as the \"reflection\" off the eyes.",
