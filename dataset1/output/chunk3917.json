If you are traveling west towards Youth Camp, the road becomes very hilly and curvy after entering the wooded area. In the winter time, the road becomes very harzardous to travel.  The road leads west to Youth Camp.  This camp has a really nice home at the enterence.  The campgrounds has several shelter houses for various activities.  The camp also has a small lake.  Inside the camp is an old bridge along the foot trails that fell down.  From the new bridge you can see a sign nailed to the old bridge that states \"Bigfoot\" tore it down (at least it did years ago when I was a kid).  Youth Camp Road also crosses the Bartholomew/Brown County line. Brown county is famous for it's heavly wooded state park. The Brown County landscape is very hilly. There are several streams in the area. Also, Youth Camp Road is between two large lakes: Harrison Lake and Grandview Lake.  The road that the sighting occured on is very dark and creepy at night.",
