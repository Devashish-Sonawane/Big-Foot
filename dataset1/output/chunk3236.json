There was a full moon, or close to it, at the time of her sighting and she \"could see pretty much everything\".She described her dog as \"usually kind of ferocious\" but it was growling, whimpering and even shaking throughout this incident and was even reluctant to get out of the truck the following morning.The figure was standing out in the open but in the shadows of the trees. \"It looked like a really tall person\" but was obviously much larger than any person could be. She was staring intently at it for a few minutes before it started to walk off, clearly on two legs.She nudged her husband quietly, as she was afraid to make any noise or move much at all, but was unable to awaken him.The following morning, she did look around to see if she could find any possible tracks but found none in the hard and dry surface.David Petti",
