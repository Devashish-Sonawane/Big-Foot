            "Follow-Up Report": "The investigator met with the witness and her husband at the sighting location about noon on 02/18/17. At the time of her sighting she was driving south on Batesville Pike. On the western edge of the highway's right-of-way there is a security fence built and maintained by the Camp Robinson military training base. Just inside the fence there is a cleared fire break/security patrol road that is approximately twenty feet wide. The area beyond the cleared area is thickly forested. At the time of the sighting the leaves were gone from the trees and in the particular location of the sighting there is  thin under-story vegetation.The witness described the animal as a tall, stoutly built, Bigfoot-like biped walking briskly northwest toward Spring Creek She specifically stated it was walking erect, with its arms hanging loosely by its sides. She said that it was covered from head to foot in black hair. It never turned to look toward the road, so her view of it was its right side. Spring Creek flows underneath the road through large diameter culverts within a few yards of her view of the creature. Heavy rains shortly after the witness' sighting would have erased any track evidence of the creature's passage through the area.It was also noted that the security fence had been knocked down by out of control vehicles at both the Spring Creek culverts and the Miles Creek bridge which is located about one half mile further north of the sighting location. There is nothing to prevent large animals of any kind from leaving the security fenced area of that military base to more base property on the east side of the road, which is not fenced and is heavily forested as well.The writer has personally received and investigated several reports of sightings of Bigfoot-like creatures from in and around the perimeter of Camp Joseph T. Robinson. (Some of the base property is open to hunters with the required paid permits. Most of the encounter reports were from hunters.)After hearing the witness' very detailed and sincere account of the incident, I concluded she is a credible observer.",

During the past several nights we have been having encounters with some sort of animal which we first thought was a bear. However, durring the daylight hours we have been finding many young trees literally being broken which we have numerous pictures of. We are camping in an area which is 9 miles up a dirt road near the Sheep Mountain trailhead. Several of the broken trees that we have been finding are very close to our campsite while others are up and down the road. There has not been any strong winds in this area for well over a week but yet these trees are broken several feet up from the ground which as anyone well knows, is not normal. We keep hearing something large and heavy walking through the brush and rocks have been thrown at one of our tents. We are all very much in the belief that we are being visited by a sasquach.",
