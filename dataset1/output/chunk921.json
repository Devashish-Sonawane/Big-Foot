The witnessed call was a very loud combination of whistle and scream, clearly answered by a second individual. The two dogs were puppies at the time. The witness suspects that the presence of a perennial wild bee hive in a nearby large tree may constitute an attraction, since some activity continues in the area to this day. The witness couple has been occasionally \"shadowed\" by an invisibly, but audibly moving animal in the adjacent forest during their walks. The dogs seem no longer afraid of these noises.",
