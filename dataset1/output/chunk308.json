We stayed at one of the furthest cabins at the resort, which backed up to a forest at the bottom of granite rock formations. These rock formations separated the Inyo National Forest from the town of June Lake.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I called and talked the witness, R.M., and he seemed like a very personable and a credible person retelling his story.  We didn't learn anything too much newer than what was in the report, but he did confirm the location, which was from this high granite ridge which is located on the south western side of the June Lake loop highway 158, where the waterfall comes down that high rocky granite cliff.  R.M. also believes that the calls that he and his brother and father heard that evening came from somewhere on that granite rock cliff; which faces east along the west side of that June Loop road.I had the witness listen to all of our Sasquatch sounds that are on our front page of the BFRO web site, and he stated the following: \"I listened to all of your calls and none were exact, but some were very close to what was heard that evening. One was the 1994 Ohio call from Columbiana County; which sounded short like mine, but his howl had a deeper sound quality to it, and the second one was the 1978 whoop/howl from Snohomish County, Washington, which also sounded close, but wasn't quite the howl I heard, because the howl I heard wasn't as long.\"  Per R.M. his howling sound had a humanistic quality to it, but it was way too loud to be a human. The witness further stated, \"After listening to this howl, in my mind it just had to be Sasquatch because I couldn't think of any other creature that could have possibly made a sound like that, or even that loud. At least not in my mind.\"In Summary: I believe that the witness heard something so out of bounds that he came to the conclusion that it just had to be a Sasquatch. The area in question is a prime area for these large creatures to live, because we humans would have a very difficult time attempting to climb up into those almost vertical granite cliffs.",

We were told we had to rent a canoe and couldn't go out by ourselves, had to go one a guided trip. I grew up in the area and had covered on foot, horse, swamp buggy, canoe, etc. But they ranger still wouldn't let us go. So we walked the boardwalk and I looked out to the cypress heads and squatting down at the base of a cypress tree was a dark figure. It would dig a little in the mud at the base of the tree and stand up and put a hand to it's mouth. I asked a Ranger for binoculars and she came out to look. The humidity was so high the binoculars fogged over and were useless. We watched the figure squat down and repeat, dig around, stand up and it did it over and over. Another Ranger came and my friend and I watched this motion for about five to seven minutes more then left.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to JC over the phone about her sighting and found her to be very engaging. JC was born in Florida and was raised close to a swamp, which she delighted in exploring while growing up. She later became a geologist and wildlife animal rescuer and intimately knows the native fauna of Florida.  JC described the creature she saw from approximately 50 yards away as\u0085\u0085Standing on two legs and over 7 \u00bd foot tall and weighing approximately 300 lbs.\u0085Covered all-over with evenly dark hair that was well kept and short. She described its hair as \u0091very form fitting and neat, like a dog after it had been groomed'. \u0085Muscular, but with a slim build. \u0091A well-formed body\u0092. \u0085Having a roundish head, with its head resting on its shoulders. \u0085Unusually long arms and human-like hands. JC did not get a look at its face because of the distance, but she could accurately describe the activity it displayed. \u0093The thing was standing in shallow mud and it didn\u0092t pay any attention to us. It might have known we were there, but it didn\u0092t act like it. I saw how it would squat down, paw around in the mud, stand up and then roll its fingers around until the mud fell away and then put something into its mouth with its fingers. It did this several times before we left.\u0094I asked JC if her friend would be willing to speak to me about this incident. JC stated that although her friend grudgingly concedes that what they saw was a bigfoot, she doubted that her friend would consent to an interview. Although JC stated that two park rangers were present during the sighting, it is also highly doubtful that they would agree to an interview based on failed past attempts to interview park rangers about bigfoot sightings.This sighting took place at the Grassy Waters Reserve, over 20 square miles of wetlands that are considered the \u0091Historical headwaters for the Everglades system\u0092. This reserve links with the Corbett Wildlife Management Area, over 60,000 acres of pristine wilderness, as well as the 11,000-acre Everglades National Park.",
