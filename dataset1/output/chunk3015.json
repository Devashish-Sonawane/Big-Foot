I happened to walk by the window in the hallway because I had to go to the bathroom. For some reason I heard a cough. It sounded like somebody clearing their throat. I had just put the pool down. We have one of those quick set ring pools that you blow up for my son. I just took it down and it was drying off, I thought somebody was out there looking at it or messing with it. So I opened the blinds and looked. I didn't see anything right off the bat.",
