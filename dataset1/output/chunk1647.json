But it was not raining at this time and the sun was shining brightly with broken clouds in the sky. Visibility was good for a long distance in every direction. Everything was sparkling with the rain on it. The roads were not well traveled. There was very little traffic. An empty piggyback logging truck may have been 150 yards in front of me. That went around the bend in the road just as I saw the creature cross between my car and the truck. I saw no other traffic for miles but an occasional camper or truck.",

            "Other Stories": "I was very excited when I reallized what this creature might be. Then my next reaction was one of fear because of its size and shape, although he did not look particularly aggressive or threatening. I wanted to stop and observe where he had disappeared into the woods, but I couldn't do it. Instead I locked my doors and slowed to a crawl in a pullout area right where he had crossed the road. I made a mental note of where I was exactly and how high the sign was that I had compared him to. I wanted to be able to show my husband. I didn't bring the car to a complete stop but did observe as best I could the surroundings. Later that week when I was on the way home I measured that it had been exactly one mile North of the Moclips turnoff. The most unusual thing to me was the color of the creature. I was surprized it was white, well, dirty white anyway. Like the color of a white dog with matted dirty hair. I had never heard of a white sasquatch in Washington before.",

I had had to work and my husband and children went ahead to get a good camp set up. I had traveled about 5 hours or more from our home in eastern Washington. Our family and friends have camped at Kalaloch several times every summer for eighteen years and I was looking forward to spending the week with them. We had not come the year before because of building a new home. I was driving along with the music on loud and thinking about what condition I would find camp after Dad and the boys having set up without me! I was also thinking of how beautiful the surrounding mountains and forest were with the rain glistening. The creature took me by surprize and it may have been half way across the road before I realized what I was seeing.",
