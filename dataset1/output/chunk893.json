I was in a small clearing around noon when I heard a series of yelps followed by whoops.These vocalizations were about a mile apart from each other and about a half mile from me. It sounded like they were communicating with each other. The whoops were very GUTTURAL. The sounds were low and the yelps were high pitched. There are wolves in the area and I guarantee that they were not wolves. I posted a Youtube video, \"Cass lake MN Bigfoot Vocalization site\". I have been back several times but only heard wolves. My wife thought she saw something standing in the distance but we were unable to confirm.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Carl, who is a long-time Fire Management employee of the US Forest Service. He received a call to investigate a site for a possible burn. The site, an abandoned C.C.C. campsite and baseball diamond, is very remote and is accessible by US forestry roads then down a rutty two-track drive. While at the site the witness started to examine the ball diamond and take mental notes as a possible location to bow hunt deer.  Carl discovered a spot which appeared to be where wolves tore apart a deer. There were bones and fur in the tall grass, and a good size area had been matted down.  While standing there he heard three high pitch screams to his right, and then a very low guttural whoop sound to his left. The whoop was a deep, resonant sound which Carl clearly remembers as \"...low, and I mean really low.\" The call-and-response cycle was repeated several times. He went back to his truck and drove up and down the roads around the lake looking for whatever made the calls, but he never saw anything. About a week later Carl took his wife to the location, and when slowly driving the road to the lake she believed she saw a tall, dark figure walking upright cross the road about a half mile ahead from them. In December 2012 Carl returned to the site and recorded his thoughts and posted this video on Youtube:At the time he was still unsure about what he encountered. Since the initial experience he's searched online to find cries similar to the low-throated whoop he heard.  Some of the vocalizations captured in Lower Michigan and featured in Report #32981 by Jim Sherman of the Michigan BFRO are nearly identical to the sounds Carl heard.Carl is an experienced outdoorsman, originally from Montana, who has had close encounters with wolves before, and even had a grizzly bear bluff charge him.  The calls made the hair on Carl's neck stand on end, and he said he has never been spooked like that in the woods before. He was positive that it wasn't loons on the lake, coyotes, or moose cries in mating season. This was a different experience.  The cries left him shaken, and when I asked whether he has gone to the location at night he chuckled and said, \"Nope. I would never go there at night.\"",
