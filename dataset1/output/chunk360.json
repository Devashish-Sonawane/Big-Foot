            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for roughly two hours and despite the incident being almost 10 years ago she was still very detailed and emotional. In the years before the incident she and friends would go to this area on the weekends, so she was very familiar and felt comfortable here. During this time she was working for the Forest Service and on her time off would hike the lesser known spots of this area. At the time of this incident she had decided to solo hike about 100 miles of the Pacific Coast Trail (PCT) and had set out on a route when she noticed a small lake on the map she wanted to visit. On the second day of the hike she made her way five miles off the PCT to the small lake and decided to set up camp for the night. The lake was towered over by a peak that rose roughly 1500 feet. From the base of the peak, about 1000 feet up was an outcropping that she describes as being \"completely flat, 50 yards in length and 200 feet in width\". The lake is situated below this in a meadow that ends in a cliff that is roughly 200 feet tall and descends at a 90 degree angle. The base of the cliff was strewn with rocks shed by the cliff face and it then opens up into a drainage. After exploring the area a little she decided to set up her camp on the outcropping away from the lake as she had seen numerous bear sign and didn't want any trouble as she slept. After eating dinner and settling in she went to sleep at about 8 p.m. She states that the moon was almost full and very bright. At about midnight she was awakened by a loud but very faint wailing that was coming from about 2 miles deep in the drainage area. She says that the wailing was consistent and repetitive with about one call every two seconds. As she lay awake listening she could hear that gradually the sound was getting louder and louder, moving at a higher rate of speed in her direction. At this point she wasn't overly concerned as there was a cliff and the peak face between her and the animal. She states she was very confident that whatever was making the noise would not be able to climb the cliff that the meadow overlooked. After about 30 minutes of nonstop calling she was able to clearly hear the animal's approach. She stated that it was \"obviously, definitely bipedal...there was no doubt in my mind that this was something very large running at a high rate of speed on two legs with a tremendous lung capacity\". Shortly thereafter she heard what sounded like rocks being overturned in addition to the wailing and running and she realized that the animal was ascending the rock field at the base of the cliff. That was followed by the sound of the animal pulling itself up the cliff face at a good pace; the wailing was mixed with the grunts and gasps of the steep ascent. It was as this point that she involuntarily urinated in her sleeping bag due to fright. She said she was overcome with the notion that somehow this animal knew she was there and was coming for her; seeking her out. The reporter made her way to the edge of the outcropping and was able to see the animal breach the cliff, slow to catch its breath, begin the wailing again, and then start running through the meadow straight for the base of the peak. She described the animal's silhouette as looking \"like a large, lean gorilla/human mix. It was very much upright with a slight bend forward, the shoulders were broad and wide, the head was close to the shoulders with no real neck being visible, the knees were at a 45 degree angle, the arms were extremely long and very muscular\". She saw hair of about 3\" in length moving as it ran. She stated that as it ran the animal was stooped over and using it's arms to help propel itself forward, almost as if it was using them to run faster. She made her way back to her sleeping bag and felt the only thing she could do was get inside and try to be as small, still, and quiet as possible. At this point the animal is still wailing and she could hear it begin to climb the peak. After only a few minutes it reached the outcropping, pulled itself up and was about 25 feet away from her. The animal seemed to be a bit out of breath and briefly stopped its wailing. Seemingly still not aware of her it hesitated, smelled the air for a few seconds, and then turned to look at her. It appeared to be stunned and caught off guard by her presence. She said that after only a few seconds it screamed again much louder and then continued straight up the peak much faster than she had seen it before. The animal continued its cries as it climbed the peak and once making it to the top (she felt) it settled itself and then began to make a different call: much louder, lower in register, and very deliberate. By now it was about 2 a.m. She stated that the animal continued to call over and over and over until about 5:30 am. She sat awake the entire night listening to it, not able, or wanting, to sleep. At about 5:30 am the animal stopped and she felt it must have descended the opposite side; she never heard it leave. The witness waited awake until first light and then packed her gear and left the area. She said she never heard the animal again. She also says she never heard anything respond to the animals calls. She felt the animal was definitely male as she could not see any breasts but did note a broad thick chest. I feel very much that the witness had this encounter and that she is telling the truth. She came off as being very genuine, sincere, detailed, and forthright. ",

The time of the day was evening and it was pretty dark and the only lights was coming from the car headlights. And it was snowing, too. So as we were heading to our destination, we saw something leap from one side to the other.  I knew that a bear could'nt of done that, because first they are in hibernation.  And if they were'nt it would have taken more than one leap to get across that narrow back road, and especially in front of a moving vehicle.  And yes it was bigger than a bear!",
