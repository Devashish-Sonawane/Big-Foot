They had always assumed that raccoons were the culprit that took the fruit. They did think it peculiar that the only fruit left was at the very top of the trees.The witnesses were concerned about the footprint and contacted the Chatham Police Department. A police officer did come to the residence and look at the footprint. The family has heard strange vocalizations in the past and the neighbor mentioned hearing unusual sounds the night before the footprint was found.The footprint was eighteen inches long and seven inches wide at the ball of the foot and was found underneath the apple tree.The large Jonathan apple tree underneath which the footprint was found. The right foot imprint showing the length of eighteen inches.The right foot imprint showing the width of seven inches.",
