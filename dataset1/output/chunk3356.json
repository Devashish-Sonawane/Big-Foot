I looked in that direction and noticed a big, bulky, hairy creature. I stood and watched for about 5 seconds and it just walked across to the other side into the brush. I couldn't tape it because I didn't have my I-pod with me. So we ran home, I got my I-pod and went back, this time with my other dog. I walked down to where the creature was and noticed a footprint. I took one picture of it on my I-pod.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I was able to meet with the witness in late December 2013 regarding this encounter.  During our meeting, several interesting details emerged regarding his sighting. In mid-March 2013, the witness decided to take the family\u0092s new Black Labrador puppy out for a walk along the Jamestown Connector Bikeway, which is located a few blocks from their residence in Jamestown.  After walking approximately one-half mile on the bikeway, the witness and the puppy were rounding a long curve and just then, the puppy started to bark and tug at the leash in the direction they were walking. The witness looked up to see what the puppy was barking at and noticed a very large, dark, and hair covered creature walking upright on two legs along the side of the bikeway, approximately 250 yards ahead of him. The large creature did not notice the witness or their family puppy, and continued to walk along the right shoulder of the bikeway.  The witness observed the creature walking for about five to ten seconds before it briefly stopped, and then crossed the bikeway (from right to left) and went down into a wooded gully, containing a small stream. As the creature crossed the bikeway in front of him, the witness noticed it was somewhat hunched over and had long arms that extended down to its knees, and swung with each step it took.  The creature was also able to cross the bikeway which, is approximately ten feet wide in about two strides. By this time the witness was very nervous, realizing that he probably had just had a Sasquatch encounter. He took out his cell phone and called his parents who advised him to grab the puppy and return home immediately.  When the witness got back home, he explained in detail what had happened during his encounter and his parents advised him not to tell anyone about it.  About an hour later, he grabbed his IPod and the family\u0092s older dog and went back out to the location where he had seen the Sasquatch cross the bikeway.  There was no sign of the Sasquatch, but the witness did notice a large footprint on the right shoulder of the bikeway, where the Sasquatch was walking just before it crossed and went down into the wooded gully.  However, the footprint appeared to be headed in the opposite direction from where the Sasquatch had crossed, on the right shoulder of the bikeway on a deer trail going into an adjacent cornfield.   This is the photo he took of the possible print:View of the witness when the creature was seen:Approximate location of the possible track:Approximate location of where it was last observed, crossing the bikeway, going down the embankment toward the small creek:Based on the details that he provided, I believe this individual is a very credible witness.  The Jamestown region of Southwest Ohio has had a number of reported Sasquatch encounters over the years, and there is also an abundance of food, water and wooded areas that are capable of sustaining a Sasquatch population.
