            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to this witness by phone. He added the following information.As he was driving around a sharp curve he saw the creature standing by the edge of the roadway in the ditch. He could only see the upper portion of the body from about the stomach up. It was about four feet from the edge of the road. The pickup he was driving had been lifted and so sat higher than normal. The head of the creature was even with his. This sighting lasted only a few seconds because of the movement of the truck. The description he gave was that the face was flat with short slick hair on it and the eyes were dark and small in proportion to the size of the face and it did not appear to have a neck. The hair around the face and on the stomach was slick but on the shoulders was tangled. After he passed he looked back and the creature was gone. He has not told anyone since this report for fear of ridicule. He moved from this area and now lives about 100 miles away. Recently a coworker told him of an incident they had around Harrison, Arkansas and he decided to share this one. This witness seemed very credible. At about the time of this incident there were other reports within a mile of this. At least one of these other incidents was investigated by the local Sheriff\u0092s Office. ",
