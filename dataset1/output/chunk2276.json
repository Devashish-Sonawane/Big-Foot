Just past Brandy Creek Recreation Area there is a turn to your left that takes you up towards Sheep Camp and it turns to dirt track about 1/4 of a mile up the road. You go past Sheep Camp heading up the mountain. Not sure exactly what the name is, but I believe its called Mt. Bally or Baldy. The road is very steep, but there are TV transmitters at the tops of this hill. The road switches back and forth up the hill. But near the top of the hill it switches back and you can see it is just like a little step before the top and right on the edge of the tree line. There is a little turn-out there where you can overlook Whiskeytown Lake. That is where we camped.",
