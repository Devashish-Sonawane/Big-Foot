            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by telephone on June 14. He was very matter of fact and said he is curious about Bigfoot. Years after his encounter, he was reading a book about Bigfoot and realized that his nighttime visitors were probably just that.One evening in September 1978, the witness and his wife were retiring to bed. His wife was suddenly scared and told him there was something outside the window. When he turned on a light, the witness expected to see raccoons but instead he observed three unidentified creatures. One of the creatures was bending over as if trying too peer into the window, another one was standing straight, and the third creature was small. They appeared to be trying to look into the bedroom window which was 8 feet high at the top. When the light was turned on, there was a sort of trilling, tongue rolling noise and then they left, walking \"bent forward\". The witness said the figures were definitely bipedal but it was too dark to determine their color. When the witness checked the window screen, there was no damage to it. He did not look for tracks because the ground was too hard.The area is heavily forested. The witness said there is a lake about 1/4 mile to the north of the house. The area is also close to the Duck Lake State Wildlife Management Area and is fairly close to the Hill River State Forest. The witness said he also heard howls or screams 2 or 3 times during the period he lived at the residence. The vocalizations came from the other side of the lake to the north of his house. I found this witness to be credible. He has lived in northern Minnesota since 1972. He has also spent 9 years working in the woods.",
