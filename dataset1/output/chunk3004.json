            "Follow-Up Report": "Ron J. and I talked for over one hour on 4/16/00 about his encounters. Ron lives in Mt. Baldy village and he loves to fish for Bass and Trout. To me, Ron was very sane, sincere, and articulate about his three different encounters that he and his friends had in and around the Morris Dam lakeside wilderness area over the years. I took a few notes on Ron's other two encounters that occurred between the late 1970's and about 6 years ago. On one of these occurences, it absconded with a backpack and ran up an impossible hill. On the other occurence, it stripped his fish stringer.Note: Ron never observed these critters in good light -- only by the light of the moon and stars. He usually observed their movements and heard their sounds in the very early morning hours, which was around 2:00 to 4:00 AM in the morning. The reason Ron and his friends fished these hours was because they were fishing illegally in the reservoir and the fishing was great. Ron and his friends never smelled anything strange. Note: In this area, you can go from being in civilization to being in a complete wilderness area in just a few steps.",

He also campaigned against their habit of leaving large portions of the carcass behind, meat that habituated grizzly bears learned to come running for at the sound of gunshots. The bears that learned to scavenge the carcasses often got into confrontations with hunters and outfitters, leading to their deaths. During his career, Jackson spent a great deal of time in the park's most remote backcountry, including the Thorofare - the place in the lower 48 states that lies furthest from a road. This is believed to be the first time Jackson has publically talked about sasquatch. ",
