            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with the witness, found to be credible. The following can be added to the report. Witness states that he had been catfishing along the western bank of the Salt Fork Marina with a friend; no other people noted as being in the area. Using chicken livers and shiners as bait, he states that they had 4-5 catfish, approx. 2-3 lbs each, on a stringer lying out on the ground. About dark, with no lantern on, both he and his friend heard 5 distinct knocking sounds (\"not in rapid succession\"), that were described as \"like a bat hitting a tree\" with an echo. Witness states that shortly afterwards, large rocks started \"bouncing off the road\" behind them, coming from a wooded area that leads up a hill. He described the rocks as being both as large as a \"bowling ball\" and \"as big as my head\". The witness expressed feeling generally unnerved, and as he and his friend started packing their gear, the rock throwing stopped. I asked him about the second witness present and was told that he didn't have his phone number and was presently not speaking to him. Salt fork is Ohio's largest state park with 17,229 acres that includes a diverse region of hills, lakes, ponds, livestock and farmland. This area has an extensive history of reported activity. ",

The witness stated that the animal's feet were moving so fast that he could hardly see them. He described the motion as almost \"blurry.\"  He stated that the animal's arms were swinging, and that hair was flowing from the arms as the animal ran.  He estimated the hair length at 6 inches.He described the animal as \"taller than a road sign,\" and being very muscular. The animal was running from a new subdivision that was under construction, across the county road toward a red house.  Behind the red house are many acres of woodland along Double Oak Mountain.  When he realized what he had just witnessed, he said  that the hair stood up on his neck.  ",
