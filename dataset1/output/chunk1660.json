            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to JG over the phone and he had these details to add.-During the summer of 1975 or 1976, when the witness was about five years old, he, his father and his mother stopped at a canal next to a narrow dirt road in the Everglades National Park to do some night fishing. -The time of day was late evening and the temperature was much cooler than during the day.-Sometime during the late evening, or after dark, something behind them, across the narrow road, began rustling the foliage and moving back and forth, in a purposeful movement. The father, not a man to be trifled with, according to the witness, picked up a piece of rock, which was light, possibly a piece of coral, and threw it towards the sound. Nothing happened so the father picked up his 6V spotlight and aimed it towards the foliage. Being that the foliage was so dense, they saw nothing, but the back and forth pacing continued in a methodical manner. The father, now worried, shouted towards the unseen perpetrator and they got no answer. -Now, startled by the lack of a response, the father and mother began to get an overwhelming sense of uneasiness, or fear, which to the witness, was not in character for his father. -They threw the five year old witness into the back of the car through the window, and not taking the time to break the large fishing rods down, the father and mother held them to the top of the car while they sped away in reverse. -According to JG, his father, a scientist, is a very practical man who doesn\u0092t scare easily. It was in his habit to take his family to remote environments in order to view alligators in the wild, to collect snakes, or to watch and study other animals in their natural settings. He is very familiar with the fauna of the Everglades and could routinely identify an animal just by the noises they made. He also has a reputation of being \u0091fearless\u0092 when it came to protecting his family, choosing to confront any threats rather than to back down from them. So when his father chose to flee, JG knew that whatever was stalking them couldn\u0092t have been something \u0091normal\u0092. It was something that terrified his father and mother so much that he fled the scene, rather than facing it head-on, which he would normally do.-JG was very matter-of-fact in relating this experience. Although he was only five years old at the time, he can vividly recall his mother and father's emotional response to the incident, and knew that whatever was in the brush was not anything normal. He feels that they were in the presence of an animal with behavioral characteristics similar to that of a skunk ape or a Florida bigfoot as they have been described in this same area. He feels that humans or other typical Floridan wildlife would not have had such an effect on his parents.I found JG to be sincere and stalwart in his description of what happened on that summer night in the Everglades.He feels adamant that his encounter was something more than an ordinary 'animal', namely because the methodical manner in which it stalked these witnesses, and because of the terror in which it evoked in them, particularly the father, which is completely outside of his usual nature. I also spoke to JG's parents, and this is what they had to add-Mr G told me that while fishing with live shiners, something 'huge' began pacing back and forth in the woods behind them. Although he shined his light at it and threw rocks and hollered at it, it didn't seem to respond in the usual manner that the animals in the vicinity should have.Mrs G told me that whatever was in the brush behind them paced back and forth in such a purposeful and methodical manner that it didn't seem natural. She describes the noises as 'breaking large limbs' and 'pushing over bushes' and that it was 'big' and 'slow'. She stated that the encounter lasted about five minutes and that those five minutes were the 'scariest time' in her life. Mr and Mrs G are very experienced campers and well accustomed to the wildlife of South Florida. ",
