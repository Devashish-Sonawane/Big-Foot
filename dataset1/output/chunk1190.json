He rented a house for a week so he could do some fishing in the area.The witness is very familiar with the area and once a year takes a similar vacation in this same general area to fish.This particular year, he took the vacation alone.The witness added the following details to his posted account:-The house is very secluded , with only a few houses in the area. None are visible from the house he rented.-The house is in an area surrounded by gamelands, national forest, and steep mountains with numerous ridges and coves.-The witness stepped out on the deck about 10pm to smoke on the evening of July 21st. It was a beautiful night, cool and still. A few dogs barked in the background.-The howls on the 21st came from the northwest. They started around 10pm and went on until about midnight. The howls each lasted about 30 seconds and were about 15-20 minutes apart over the two hour period. The howls were deep, long and low.-The howls on the 23rd also came from the northwest, but were more distant, perhaps on the other side of the mountains or ridges.The witness heard several howls on the 2nd night, all similar to the howls from the 1st night.-The witness listened to the Ohio recordings on the BFRO site and said the howls he heard sound very similar to the 1994 Ohio - Moaning Howl.-The other nights at the vacation house were very windy. He did not hear any coyotes while he was there.",
