            "Observed": "Hiking the Seven Sisters Trail from Mt Holyoke to the Notch in the Hadley / Amherst area of Massachusetts. My hiking partner and I got to Taylor's Notch and could hear the wind ripping through making eerie noises. We both heard a lot of whistling  and breaking branches which I initially attributed to the wind going through the rocky ledges of Taylor's Notch. We hiked over one large hill and the wind was lessening but we realized the whistling was closer and then there were whooping noises and calls along with the whistles. The calls were going back and forth and I realized we were surrounded. We kept talking loudly hoping to scare off any animals and kept my bear spray in hand for the next mile or so. Not sure what it was but highly unusual and did not sound like a grown or baby bear,canine, coyote, mountain lion, or fox. I frequently hike and spend time outdoors. I am at a loss as to what was with us that day. I am going back soon to see if I can find more.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the reporting party via telephone today. The witness states she was hiking with another female on August 26, 2020.  They were hiking an advanced section of the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail. This also crosses the Robert Frost Tail System within the Holyoke Mountain Range. Just before noon they started hearing \"whistles and whoops\". It seemed like the sounds were coming from both sides of the trail. The foliage was thick and overgrown. They were not able to see or identify what was making the noises. They kept hiking several miles further. They felt they were being followed by something on both sides of the trail.  After about 45 minutes they came across other hikers and felt that they were no longer being followed. The hiker reports that the whistles were nothing she or her partner had ever heard in the woods. Both are avid hikers and live in a rural part of  Massachusetts with an abundance of wildlife. The Holyoke Mountain Range is a popular recreation area with numerous trails ranging from low impact to advanced hiking.  It is heavy visited through the year.I spoke with the reporting party for almost an hour. She was well spoken and clearly restated the facts of their encounter several times.  She was very matter of fact and articulate with her descriptions. I will be meeting up in the near future for a face-to-face interview. I am very familiar with the location in this report. Living only a few miles away I have hiked the area many times. I have had multiple encounters in this area for the past several years. I currently have 7 open cases for the mountain range. It is my opinion that these are the same Sasquatch that frequent the land near my residence as it is only a few mile hike. The vocals described by the witness are identical to the ones I have personalty heard. In 2017, James Bobo Fay and BFRO investigator Marc DeWerth both heard similar vocals at this location while here. ",
