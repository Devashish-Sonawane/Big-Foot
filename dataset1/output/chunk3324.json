            "Observed": "I had a little pony I was riding and I was supposed to meet a friend (Holly) by this little village.  I was riding bareback that day, and as my pony (King) came to the top of this hill, (we were on a little back road) he suddenly stopped dead and braced himself and put his ears straight forward.  (As though he were looking and listening to something)  I looked down the road, and about 400 feet away, I saw this big reddish brown thing on the road, (which happens to be the same color as Hollys horse)  and it was moving toward us.  Keep in mind this all happened so very quickly, but at the time it seemed like everything was going slowly.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness stated that, she has not told any one except family, and one close friend about these incidents for fear of public ridicule.She stated that, the animal was approx 100 -110 feet away from her when she realized it was NOT another horse.  She said her horse tensed up, ears forward, highly alert when first spotting the animal.She also stated that, the scream she heard, was unlike anything she has heard before. She is familiar with the sound of bobcat & cougar. She described this as, \"a cat in great pain, being ripped apart\".She also goes into the woods often, and on several occasions, has felt like she was being watched, and has had a \"feeling\" come over her, described as \"get out....Get Out....GET OUT NOW!!!\".This area has a history of sightings in that time era.",

Totaly amazing they said watching it take off running down the road with huge strides, then as the plane got almost over the top it leeped off the road running uphill jumping stumps like nothing, they spun around for another look and it was gone.",
