His first encounter was in 1983 in Lawrence County, Ky. in a secluded area surrounded by mountains, in the area of Louisa. He woke to see the creature looking in the window. He said it was at least 7 feet tall, as the window was high off the ground. He saw it from mid chest up. He stated that his uncles were 6 feet tall and were not tall enough to look in the window. He described the face as apelike, but more human in appearance. The hair was described as very dark brown/black. When the creature reached in, the arm looked massive. The arm and hands were hair covered except for the fingers. He was very frightened, but was reassured by the adults that what he had seen was harmless.His second encounter occurred on the Rowan/Lewis county line, while ginseng hunting. An avid outdoorsman and hunter, he was well aware of the possibility that this could have been a bear, but based on his experience, it seemed that whatever was stalking him was following him more out of curiosity than a predatory situation.
