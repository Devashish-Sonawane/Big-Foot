There was an over powering smell, and when we were walking back to our car we felt like we were getting followed and being watched.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke to the witness on 6/23/05:The report references the Allegany River.  This is not correct.  It is the Genesee River.  The witness does not live in the area and thought it was the Allegany.Witness had two encounters.  The first occurred February 1, 1998 (date is approximate).  It was a warm winter day with snow on the ground.  Because of the character of the day the two girls decided to take a walk down an old path near the home of one of the girls (not the witness).  As they walked along, the girls heard what they thought was a deer in the woods next to them.  This went on for about three minutes.  When they were approximately one mile into the walk an animal jumped out onto the path approximately five feet away from them and proceed to quickly walk away.  They observed the animal for approximately 30 seconds.The animal was six to seven feet tall with wide shoulders and a muscular build.  Its hair was grayish-white and about three inches long.  The hair was thick and shaggy and visibly matted in some places.  It had long arms that swung in a long arc.  It had a long stride that allowed it to move very quickly.  Facial features were not observed.The area in question is very hilly with swampy-wet areas.  Deer and small animals are plentiful as well as fish from the Genesee River.The second encounter occurred around July 17,  2003.  The witness and a friend (not the same friend as the first encounter) were walking along the same path.  As they were nearing the place of the first encounter they heard something following them as it moved through the swamp.  They then smelled a overwhelming, powerful odor and the forest became dead silent.  It was the dead silence that startled and frightened them.  They quickly proceed back to their car and felt as if they were being followed.On July 5, 2005 this investigator (Mateja) visited the area.  The area is only two miles outside of the town of Wellsville.  The footpath runs between two roads (Weinrick and Carter) and is at most two miles long.  Some of it proceeds over private property and farm land which I was not able to access.  The path runs roughly down the middle of a narrow land mass that is sandwiched between River Road and the Genesee River.  This narrow strip of land ranges from 200 feet to 600 yards wide.  At approximately one mile into the walk the land mass is approximately 200 yards wide and the most likely spot where the encounter occurred.  Here there is sufficient cover for a large animal to remain concealed.  The area on the opposite side of the river is large and wooded but I was not able to explore it because it is all private land.  I do not believe a Bigfoot would reside in any permanent capacity in the small area between the river and road and I did not find any signs of a large animal recently inhabiting the area.  However, the area is rural and becomes increasingly so as one moves farther out of town.  In general, the area is very hilly with large tracts of unbroken forest.  Certainly a Bigfoot/Sasquatch could easily move about undetected between the river and the surrounding hills.",
