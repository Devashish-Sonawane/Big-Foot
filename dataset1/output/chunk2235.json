            "Observed": "I was hunting late Elk (doe) up in the Olympic National Forest in late Oct or early Nov.   I was hunting alone on an old logging road I'd picked because it went into the mountains the farthest. Due to my job (ARMY), I arrived late, just before sundown just as a couple were hauling up the last piece of an elk doe his wife had shot that morning.   He was still cussing her because she watched it cross the road in front of her and waited until it got to the bottom of the ravine before shooting it.  Well they left and I spent the night in my truck.   All night it snowed lightly, which is great for tracking. I was parked at the end of NFR 2433, I arose before dawn and just stayed in the back of the truck, I had a clear view down the road for about half a mile. I hadn't seen anything all AM when suddenly I saw what I thought was another hunter step out into the open on a curve in the road about 1000' away. He/it looked at me, walked to the edge of the road overlooking a 500' drop to the valley floor & it just froze there, it looked like it was scanning for game. All I could see besides its outline was its head occasionally scanning.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Wayne and he recounted the experience of the sighting he had. His view up the road gave him a clear 1/4 mile line of sight. At the time he witnessed the figure come out of the forest to the road, he had his rifle on his back and was near his truck. What he thought was a hunter at the time, looked in his direction for a period of 10 seconds and then turned and began to scan over the territory below him. Wayne watched it with his bare eyes and decided not to point his rifle at it for a period of 1-2 hours. The subject then swung its body off its left foot and took one step off the edge of the road to the rocks and slope going down toward the valley below and was out of sight.Wayne then went to the location where he had seen the subject and found no tracks on the road and no sign of the individual. The hill side it went down was at a 60-80 degree angle with boulders and trees. Wayne noted that there was a elk gut pile down below from the kill that the couple had made that morning.After finding that the individual went down such a steep hillside with no apparent signs of having gone down the slope, he drew his 44 magnum and slowly returned to his truck and then left.",
