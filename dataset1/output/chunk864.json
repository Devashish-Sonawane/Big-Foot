            "Follow-Up Report": "Mt. Breckenridge is located in the Sierra Nevadas east of Bakersfield and is easily visible from the city.The witness saw six to eight tracks, one of which was \"crystal clear\" and 1/2 to 3/4 inch deep.  The footprints were made when the soil was dry and they appeared to be fresh.  The stride length was estimated to be five feet.  The prints were located about 1/8 mile from a natural spring.  The witness also noticed some bushes with red berries that appeared to have been picked at a height of 6 to 6 1/2 feet off the ground.I received these subsequent updates from the witness:September 2004:  I have an update for you ,while on a hunting trip this past Saturday about two miles from where I found the tracks I came across another set of tracks, I'm not positive what or who left them the area they were in was soft soil covered in a thick layer of old dried leaves and they appeared to be old I attempted to remove the leaves and debris but found no clear features, however they were about 14 to 15 inches in length with a stride of about 4 and one half feet I'm not sure what left them but it was strange.September 2005:  While hunting in the same area I heard what appeared to be a grunt/growl to my left followed by a high pitched scream farther down the mountain to my right this went on for about 2 or 3 minutes.",
