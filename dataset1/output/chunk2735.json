            "Observed": "A friend of mine cornered me late one day and told me a strange tale. He was going to shoot a rifle that he owns and he said he smelled something dead or rotten. He thought maybe someone had killed a deer or another critter. As he proceeded to walk through the woods, he said he saw a huge animal hunkered staring at him.  He said the shoulders were massive. His rifle was loaded, but he felt he didn't have a big enough gun (.223 cal.) They stared at each other for a few seconds, but my friend turned to the right and proceeded forward to get away from the \"MONSTER\" (his word). He said it bolted in the same direction as he did and ran past him in a second and a half. I said was it a bear?  He said no. Was it on two legs or four? He said two. It broke tree branches as it ran thru the trees and brush. He was so scared that he did not return to the woods for 8 or 9 months, and when he did, it was with a loaded 12 gauge shotgun loaded with deer slugs.",

He was adamant about how huge the animal was.\u0095 The animal was very stocky and fit looking.\u0095 Its hair was blackish gray and about 2 inches long. The hair was not matted at all.\u0095 Its neck appeared very thick and the arms did seem somewhat longer than a human\u0092s.\u0095 The closest he was to the animal was 20 feet.\u0095 He could not see the face until the animal was several hundred feet away and he could not make out any facial details.\u0095 The person who submitted the report hunts in the same woods and has heard what he considered to be whooping sounds at about half a mile away.
