The following details can be added to the report:--Witness used to be a Marine, currently is a civilian tech writer for the Air Force.--Witness has visited the area before, but had not been in this location for about a year prior to event.--When they heard the sounds, there were no crickets, wind or other sounds.--Hunting partner felt that there were two individuals calling back and forth to each other, witness agreed because calls were coming from various areas, and since they did not hear any movement (no limbs breaking, etc.), he didn't feel that a single creature was moving to each of the sound locations.--Hunting partner described the sound as being like a seal, but higher in pitch.--Witness felt it was a growling scream.--No one saw anything unusual the next day.  They were hunting so they were looking for animal sign, and did not see anything worthy of noting.--Witness also detailed an event from the next day.  Around 9-10 in the morning as they were traveling down Bodfish Road, his hunting partner asked him to stop the car because he saw something he thought was a bear cross the road.  The witness could see the area the animal traveled, because the tree limbs were still moving.  The partner got out of the car with his gun to track the animal and could hear it moving in front of him.  However, about 100 yards in, the animal stopped moving and this spooked him so he went back to the car.  They did not check for prints because they were not thinking \"bigfoot\".--Note report 5294, which reports footprints from the general  location on Oct. 27th (the day the \"bear\" walked across the road).",
