            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length about his observation. The witness is a semi-retired owner of a financial services group in California. He holds a degree from the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business, and served in the United States Marine Corps. At the time of the encounter, the witness was around 10-11 years of age. There was a creek in a heavily wooded area behind the witness' home that the local children would dam with rocks occasionally to make a swimming hole during hot summer days. On this particular day, the witness and his friend (now deceased) had been down at the creek for hours building a dam. They were walking the path back towards the witness' house and were within about 100 yards of the home when they heard the distinct sounds of something large approaching them from the pine forest that surrounded them. As the witness recalls, there was no initial fear, as they were quite close to the house, and had never encountered anything dangerous or frightening there before. It was dusk, and as such was beginning to get dark. The sounds were described by the witness as heavy footfalls approaching at a \"slow trot\", akin to the sounds of a horse or mule. This sound was accompanied by the sounds of movement through the pine trees. The witness' first thought was that they were hearing a mule or horse that had gotten loose from a neighboring property, so they stopped immediate along the path and waited for the approaching animal to come close to them so that they could identify it, and possibly catch it and return it to its owners. Emerging at a small gully approximately 50 feet away from the boys was a large, upright, hair-covered creature that the witness described as \"massive and ape-like\".  In the fading twilight he could see that the creature was approximately seven feet tall and had a uniform covering of long hair on its body. The boys stared at the creature for a few seconds before breaking away and running as fast as they could back to the house. The witness was absolutely terrified at the sight of the creature he had just seen. It was something that he was completely unprepared for. Roughly a week later, the witness' brother and a few of his friends claimed to have encountered the same creature during daylight hours while playing in the creek. Alarmed, the neighborhood parents called the local Sheriff's office. The police assured the parents that the children had likely seen a bear, but the kids (some of them teenagers) were adamant that what they had seen was not a bear. It is important to note that these events occurred before the modern \"bigfoot\" media hype, and as such, the witness had no point of reference for the creature he'd seen. Over a decade later, the witness saw the Patterson-Gimlin film on television and was awestruck at the footage, particularly by the similarity of the film subject to the creature that he encountered. The encounter has had a long-lasting impact on the witness. During our conversation he told me that a few years ago he had visited Yellowstone National Park, and during his visit had a close, harrowing encounter with one of the park's resident grizzly bears. As he put it, \"I remember that grizzly encounter as if it happened last month, but I remember the encounter with the creature over five decades ago as if it happened last night.\" The immediate area has changed quite a bit since the mid-1950s, but the general area itself still holds a great deal of wildlife. The area is nestled between two National Wildlife Refuges; the Piedmont NWR, and Bond Swamp NWR. Both of these refuges have yielded multiple bigfoot reports. ",
