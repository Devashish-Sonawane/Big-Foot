            "Observed": "My brother and I were canoeing on Lake George, in N.Y state at about sunset. We headed south for 10 minutes to an area known as Deer Leap. At lake side it is a boulder strewn area with cliffs rising 600 feet above the shoreline. As we were begining to come on to this area we saw something standing on shore. It was brownish in color and standing straight up with it's arms at it's side. It was about the size of a small man and very thin. Its body was facing south, looking down the shorline when it suddenly turned its head directly towards us and looked very intently. We  whispered to each other and watched it while it watched us. We were 2 grown men paddling parallel to the shore and about 200 feet out but we could not summon up the courage to go in closer. This thing had a strange look, almost a crazed grin. Like a giant Lemur.  The sun was set now as we continued to watch it in the shadows of the mountain. As it was standing next to an old, dead pine tree, it turned and climbed, sloth-like up the tree about 20 feet to the first and only large limb and onto the crook of a branch. We paddled back around and as we approached it again cocked its head directly at us, after a minute or so it turned its face downward into its body and became as if it were a part of the tree. Just a lump on the crook of the branch. You would not know it was there unless you saw it move. I have been in this area all my life and have never seen anything like this and have not seen it since.",
            "State Population Density": "381.7",
            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness described the animal as about five feet tall and extremely skinny, like \"a teenaged boy.\"  It appeared to be covered with reddish brown hair and had a pale face, expressive eyes and mouth, and a \"deranged\" smile or smirk on its face.  Unlike a bear, its arms were long and it lacked a pronounced snout.The witness supplied these two drawings:When it first spotted them, it turned its head and looked down its shoulder at them.  It was standing ten to fifteen feet away from a dead pine tree that was about thirty-five feet tall and devoid of pine needles; the lowest branch was about fifteen feet above the ground.Once the witnesses had passed the animal and turned their aluminum canoe around, it had already begun climbing the tree.  It was ten feet up the trunk near the lowest branch, moving slowly like a sloth.  It crawled onto the branch and moved its head to look at them again.  Then it tucked its chin down into its chest and appeared to blend in with the reddish brown bark on the tree.  The witness said that, once it blended into the tree, \"The shape didn't have any definition to it.\"The witness described it again to me in writing:  \"As soon as it put it's head down into it's underbelly, it looked like a large bump on the branch.  If you hadn't seen it move it's head you would not know it was anything but a large branch.  When it bent over on the branch blending in with the bark of the tree, it's fur had a pine bark look too.\"During this sighting the witness felt no fear, however he did feel that there was a \"boundary line,\" or a certain area between him and the animal that should not be encroached upon.The witness' brother was contacted and he corroborated his brother's story, although his recollection of the sighting was not as detailed.  He said that the creature was about four feet tall, and both sloth-like and orangutan-like in appearance, although he did not see its face.  He doesn't remember seeing the creature standing on the shore before it climbed the tree; nor does he remember seeing it tuck its head down and \"blend in\" with the tree as his brother did.According to the witness, several years later two girls, one of which is a lifeguard at a nearby YMCA camp, saw something they called \"Monkey Boy\" jumping on and off a wall.  Attempts to locate and contact these witnesses have thus far been unsuccessful.Update 11/7/2009: Another witness may have seen the same or another one of these creatures. See the email sent to the BFRO below. [Mike Aragona, BFRO Investigator New Jersey]To whom it concerns: My girlfriend told me of an experience she had at Lake George 11 years ago when she saw a \"monkey boy\" at Lake George. I immediately searched for \"monkey boy lake george\" and found your case #2405:http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=2405 The description there is a striking match with her story, and in the same area. In fact, she worked at Silver Bay (the \"YMCA camp\" referenced in the report) and that is where she had her sighting. Her physical description is downright identical to the one provided by the witnesses in #2405. She saw the picture in the report and said, \"That's him.\" The one difference is that she remembers the animal having a short tail. She doesn't want to contact you but I told her I would anyway. There's even a chance that she is one of the two girls mentioned in your report in reference to the YMCA camp, though her experience did not occur with another girl but with her boyfriend at the time.

            "Observed": "I was hunting with a friend and we had been out since early morning, it was hot and we were tired. We were just trying to get back to the car, which was parked, on a dirt road about a mile up a ridge that was directly in front of us. The brush we were walking through was thick, really difficult to get through. We were walking single file and I was behind my friend with my head down concentrating on just trying to get through the brush with out tripping. Suddenly I heard an incredibly loud disturbance to my left and at the same time my friend had froze in his tracks. As I looked to my left, this animal, there is no doubt a Bigfoot, came tearing down the ridge right in front of us. It could not have been 10-15 feet from us. It was so close, it must have been sleeping and we woke it, because something that big would have made a lot of noise crashing through the brush on approach, and I heard nothing until it was right on us. We both watched it run past us to our right, on down this ridge and disappear into the forest. It was huge, covered with black fur and long, long arms. As it went by us it turned its face toward us and its face was flat and hairless, but almost black, like its face had been caked with mud all its life. It was bent forward slightly, running and it was still 7-8 feet tall. I was shocked at the speed. This encounter took no longer than 10 seconds. We both stood there scared to death, really scared. We both were familiar with the concept of Bigfoot, and had heard the stories of \"monsters in the woods\". After we both got under control, I said, \"what was that\" and my friend said \"I don\u0092t know but I'm getting out of here\". We both started to run as best we could for the fence line and the road about a mile in front of us. When we reached the road, we were climbing a fence that lined the road, as were crossing this fence we heard the most bone chilling scream I have ever heard in my life. This just added to our terror and we continued to run for the car. We did make it out of there with nothing else to report. I had returned to that same area many times after, always with the same friend and never saw or heard another thing. That was 31 years ago and I can still remember it like it was this morning.",
