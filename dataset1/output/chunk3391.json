We sat around the fire talking and laughing until about 12:30 AM and then decided to crawl into our sleeping bags and go to sleep. It had to be June or July of 1981 or so.  Once in my sleeping bag I curled up and could just see the campfire dying out when I heard a howl that made me want to pack up and leave right then. It wasn't dog, or coyote. It was scary and awful. My friend decided it best to come into my pup tent. I know he heard it to, but denied it. I laid there scared to death and wide awake watching the fire still dying and heard footsteps like a man walking. There was no one up in those woods. We both laid awake until sunlight and struck camp and headed down the hill to the farm. I looked around for signs that someone had been up there with us, but it was covered in leaves. I asked my friend about the howl and he said it could have been a number of things I heard, but never admitted he heard it too.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness noted that she hiked around a 1/4 mile up the trail looking for bugs. Then, the birds became silent and there was an awful smell in the air, which made her look off towards the left side of the trail into the woods. There, about 50 feet away is where she saw the creature standing very still. She thought it might have been a weird type of tree until the upper torso turned and she could see the creature looking directly at her. She estimates that the creature was at least seven feet tall and very wide in proportion. Its body was covered with black colored hair that was somewhat matted on the torso but very smooth looking on the arms. The arms hung to at least the knees. The face was very flat looking, had dark set eyes, an almost una-brow forehead (she doesn't remember the mouth), and its head sloped to a point in the back. The following year she went to the Cleveland Zoo to see the silver back gorillas and said the creature she saw looked more human than ape, was much larger than the silver back, and was at least another eight to ten inches wider at the shoulders. She never told her parents until she was out of High School about her experience in fear of ridicule.  To check out a map of the campground area at Atwood Lake, go to this website.",

They saw something walking up right covered with gray hair. The lower part of the animal was blocked by bushes, but they saw all they wanted to see and said it stood about 7 to 8 feet tall. The creature was 70 to 80 ft. from the witnesses. The creature had very large eyes.",
