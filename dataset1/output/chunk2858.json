            "Follow-Up Report": "A phone interview was conducted with the witness who provided the following additional details and information.Access to the 70 acre Oxbow Lake Preserve is through a residential community and the site is popular with local birders. No other cars were observed in the roadside parking area before or after the incident. The witness was in the preserve for a total of 30-45 minutes and did not see or hear any other birders or hikers.The small lake is U-shaped and there is a single point of access to the trail which ends about halfway around the lake. The witness had walked approximately 10 minutes on the trail when she heard the tree fall. Upon hearing the tree begin to fall, the witness turned and observed the top of the tree hitting the ground. The witness noted that the tree was alive based on green-leaf top; the 30-40 feet height was estimated based on the height of surrounding trees as it fell. The tree fell in a relatively dense area of surrounding trees and brush and the witness did not see any movement near the tree.The witness continued to walk approximately 200 yards further on the trail which rises up above the lake. She then remained quiet and stationary for approximately 10 -15 minutes while looking for waterfowl in and around the lake.Upon getting a sense of being \u0091watched\u0092, she turned around and began walking back down the trail and briefly stopped at the trail location where she saw and heard the tree fall. No strong odor or smell was noted upon her second pass through this part of the trail.The witness continued walking back down the trail and briefly stopped at a clearing overlooking the lake.  She described the howls as \u0091primate-like\u0092 and the first two howls were made very close together, followed by a 5-10 second pause and then one, possibly two additional howls.The witness has been back to the preserve several times since the incident and at different times of the day, and has not heard or seen anything else unusual. Oxbow Lake Preserve is located in the far northwestern part of Anne Arundel Country and is part of the Little Patuxent River watershed which feeds the larger, more expansive Patuxent River watershed located in Montgomery County a few miles to the northwest. The preserve contains an abundant amount of birds and waterfowl including red-tailed hawks, Canadian Geese, Blue-winged Teal, Great Blue Heron and Great Egret.This incident took place approximately 8 miles from Report #5297 and despite being a relatively developed area there is a large tract of undeveloped land that connects these two areas. Reports #3214 and #3602  are also within 20 miles to the southeast of this incident.",
