            "Observed": "11/20/12 I have been keeping my eyes peeled for any potential sign even though I live in a fairly populated area. I live on and drive up and down Carrollton Rd several times a week. What I noticed was a fresh break of a young tree, about 50-60 feet in from the road. Due to brambles, and being private property, I didn't go in for exact measurements but I'm a pretty good estimator. This break is about 6 feet off the ground, maybe 5, the tree is approximately 4-5 inches in diameter. I noticed that there are significant scrape marks on one the road side of the tree, can't see the other side, The marks are ONLY below the break. I also found what looks like definite depressions in the leaf litter, with a bit of compressed bare ground, one about 6 feet in from the road at the tree line, and one about 2 feet from the guardrail. I carry a tape measure with me in my car as part of my tools for farriery, so I was able to lay it out at what I believe is the length of the depressions and get pictures.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness noticed the tree break and stopped to investigate. Noticed imprints of large human-shaped footprints in the wet leaves that blanketed the woodland's floor heading towards the tree break. Although there isn't any discernible definition each of the tracks was approximately fifteen inches in length and about half as wide with a four foot stride between them. After investigating the break and the prints, the witness couldn't resist clacking two rocks together. The witness was surprised to get a response in the form of two knocks in return.After talking over the phone and having spent a few hours in person with the witness, I found the witness to be quite credible and sincere.Here are the pictures that the witness took that day. The captions and commentary are by the witness. ",
