            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness in a phone interview and the following information can be included.   The witness had not been out of his truck very long when he heard movement through the woods on the opposite side of the road.  The witness told me he thought it was a deer and didn\u0092t think much of the noise.  As he returned to his truck is when he saw the creature emerge from the woods from the opposite side of the road at a distance of about 30 yards.  The witness described a very tall creature with dark brown hair.  According to the witness, very muscular arms and legs were visible and the arms were long and swung behind the creature. The creature was focused on crossing the road and did not look in the direction of the witness.  The witness was stunned by what he had seen, but still drove up the road to the point where the creature entered the woods.  The witness slowed and looked out the passenger window and that\u0092s when he noticed the eye reflection.  The yellow reflection was probably from the truck\u0092s turn signal lights; still, it was enough to motivate the witness to promptly leave the area.A short time after the interview, the witness contacted me to tell me that he was in the area again and heard what he described as wood knocking.  I made an appointment with the witness to show me the area as BFRO report #29018 is in the same county and similar in nature to this witness\u0092 sighting.  At our first opportunity, the witness and I met and he showed me the area where he first heard the noise and the spot where the creature crossed the road.  The witness demonstrated how the creature crossed the road, and claimed that it could not have been human as it crossed the road in two strides and was out of sight in a couple more.  There is a drainage trench on each side of the road and the road measured 22 feet across. There is also a road sign at the point where the creature started its crossing  and the sign assisted in the witness' height estimate.  I\u0092ve included a photo of the road and crossing point for reference.  We continued to survey the area and noticed numerous wild berry bushes as well as various fruit trees.  According to the witness, there is an ample deer population in the area.  While this location is close to an industrial facility, the area does become fairly rural within a short distance. Additionally, several of the residences in the area contained sizable gardens along with fruit trees.During the interview and subsequent visit, I found the witness to be credible.  He enjoys the outdoors and hunting, but stressed he is not interested in seeing this creature again.  The witness did agree to remain observant of his surroundings and contact me if there is any additional activity.
