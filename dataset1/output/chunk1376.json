            "Follow-Up Report": "The submitter is an avid big game hunter and very familiar with elk, bear, and mountain lion behavior and vocalizations. He has heard many elk and mountain lion vocalizations in his life and believes these vocalizations were nothing like any he has ever heard. Specifically, he indicated that the volume, resonance, and \"baseness\" of the growls were greater than that of any other animal he has heard and most like the bigfoot recordings linked on the BFRO web site. I asked the submitter what message he thought was being conveyed by the growl - \"get the heck out of here\" was his response. The growl was so frightening to this avid woodsman that he stopped hunting for the day and retreated to camp after hearing them. He and several others were bow hunting in the area and he was carrying a small side arm solely as a bear deterrent should the need arise. According to the submitter, he saw very little bear sign (tracks, scat, etc.) that year, much less than expected. The submitter also indicated that the tree damage he noted was not consistent with elk rubs. The damaged trees were altered at a level too high for most elk and the bark was not rubbed or scraped as one would expect from antler damage. Instead the trees, most of which were from 1 - 2 inches in diameter, typically had only a few small branches broken and then the main trunk twisted and broken off at about 7 feet above the ground. He also indicated that there were no claw marks as one might expect from bear damage.The other members of the hunting party which he referrs to as having heard vocalizations before he arrived are also of the opinion that they heard something completely unknown to them. Two have concluded that the responsible animal was a sasquatch. The submitter added that these other members were so frightened that they spent a good deal of the night armed and locked in their vehicles. This happened only after the animal vocalizing had moved so close to camp that they felt intimidated. Considering that the camp had a fire going at the time, this aggressive behavior seems unlikely from an elk, coyote, bear, or mountain lion. The individuals who were part of this earlier event have been asked to submit details of their encounter to the BFRO.Not much can be understood from the arrival of the lost and frightened dog at their camp, other than to note that it wore a radio collar and was of the curly haired breed of dog typically used by bear hunters in the area. The two vocalization incidents and the tree breaks provide evidence consistent with sasquatch activity. Although not conclusive, these events point toward activity not representative of known animals in the Jemez Mountains. The witness has provided accurate, credible observations to support the likelihood that the activity noted was the result of one or more sasquatch. ",

It was about 45 minutes till dark and my feeder just went off there were some doe out to the right of the feeder about 100yards. I was watching them then out of the corner of my eyes I seen something walking on 2 feet I pulled my rifle up to look through the scope and seen it was big and brown. It had hair all over it, it was like nothing I have ever seen. It came out of some woods in the neighbors pasture and was walking towards me. It was about 7 feet tall and it looked to be about 500lbs it disappeared into the woods to the left of my neighbors pasture and I didn't see it again I know the people that hunt over there and they are all around 6 foot and no where as big as this was.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness, Mr. Paxton Moore regarding his report filed. He reported he has about 400 acres of hunting land. From his stand he can see all the way across an open field to a wooded area in his neighbors pasture. On this occasion he was watching some deer through his high power scope on his gun at about 100 yards away. He saw movement out of the corner of his eye and focused the scope on the creature he describes as about 400 yards away. As he watched, the creature walked from a wooded area in the neighbor's pasture and moved to his land. He states he only saw the creature for about 5 seconds as it crossed into a tree line and disappeared. Witness states he (witness) is 6\u009210\u0094 and this creature was much taller than him. He estimated his weight to be at least double his weight of 300 lbs. Witness described the creature as moving slow, but very long steps. Witness stated he first thought it could have been a man in a ghillie suit, but it had fur and a face. There should not have been any other hunters in the area. He knows all of the hunters on his neighbor\u0092s property and none of them are even close to this size. There is another deer stand in that area. He used his scope to look in that stand later and there was no one in the stand. The two properties have a road between them. He looked for tire tracks when he left and there was none. He reported he and friend have been in this area since this incident and heard whistles. When they would turn on a flashlight whistles would stop. They would turn off the flashlight and whistle. They heard a whistle in response to their whistle and sounding the same. He states this has happened more than once. Since this incident happened in 2014 I asked witness why he was just now reporting. He said he was not aware of this website until just recently when he stumbled on it and filed the report. ",
