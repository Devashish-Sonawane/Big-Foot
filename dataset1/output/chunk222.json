The witness feels the animal was aware of their presence. It disappeared into the pines when they tried to follow it. Bears frequent the area when blueberries are in season.  There was one footprint cast, given to DNR.  The witness also noted one footprint on the bottom of a stream in the clay.  No vocals were heard.The witness also mentioned that he had contacted Peter Byrne regarding his experience and was told that bigfoot was limited to the PNW and that he had to have seen something else.  So he sat it on the shelf until submitting to our site.",
