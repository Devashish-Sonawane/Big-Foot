My wife and I were awake, she was cleaning in the kitchen, and I was in the living room reading. Suddenly a LOUD howling sound began and at the same moment the trailer began shaking very violently. The howling and the shaking lasted ten seconds, but it was very loud as that of a bull horn. My first response was thinking we were having an earthquake.My second was someone outside somehow making the noise while somehow shaking the trailer. I grabbed my pistol and ran outside. There was nothing moving outside any where.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness recounted the event via telephone. The witness and his wife had purchased the property for the purpose of building a house on the land. Previously, the area had been used as a fishing camp. A trailer sat empty on the property for several years. The witness and his family were using the trailer as a temporary home while the house was being built. On the evening of the incident, the trailer began shaking violently, as if a large creature were thrashing it from side to side. This was accompanied by an incredibly loud howl, which the witness described as identical to the 1994 Ohio - Moaning Howl on the BFRO website. The howl was not only powerfully loud, but resonated inside the small structure, amplifying the sound within. It ascended and descended in pitch, with a siren-like quality. The witness' wife began screaming in fear, and the shaking and howling suddenly ceased. The witness retrieved a handgun and went outside, but couldn't see or hear anything in the environment.  It is the witness' interpretation that the animal may have used the abandoned trailer as a temporary shelter in the past, as there were signs of various animals entering and exiting the trailer when they purchased the property. The witness suggests that the animal may have been responding to the shelter being occupied by people on this particular occasion. This may be an accurate interpretation, supported by other stories of sasquatches temporarily occupying abandoned human shelters or structures. Likewise, there are other accounts across the continent of sasquatches shaking or striking homes and shelters with human occupants. The Ohoopee River and the surrounding areas have yielded other reports that GA-BFRO members are aware of. It is a heavily forested area, interspersed with rural agricultural plots.  ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "[Edited by Matt Moneymaker]I first spoke with this witness, Rick B., by phone on October 26, 2008.  He is a very credible gentleman in his fifties, and an avid solo backpacker. He enjoys hiking alone in very challenging terrain.The sighting occurred in the afternoon. He was roughly 200 yards from the two figures. He spotted them while resting a short distance from the Pacific Crest Trail (\"PCT\"). He observed them for nearly 10 minutes before they disappeared down into a deep canyon. The PCT is a long, scenic backpacking trail that extends from the Mexican border to the Canadian border (see photo galleries) along the major mountain ranges of the Pacific states -- California, Oregon and Washington.  The PCT is one of a few backpacking trails in the US that are in excess of 1,000 miles long. Those who attempt to walk the entire length of these trails consider the challenge to be akin to climbing Mount Everest. The three major trail are the Pacific Crest Trail, the Continental Divide Trail (Rocky Mountains), and the Appalachian Trail (Appalachian Mountains).  There is a history of reports near segments of all three of the these trails.  The reason could be that these trails often follow natural high elevation routes through wilderness areas which tend to have cooler temperatures in the Summer than almost anywhere else in the US.  Or the reason could be that sasquatches have seen human backpackers following these routes and they understand them to be safe pathways that allow relatively easy travel for long distances while avoiding populated areas.---------As the witness was resting near the PCT he noticed two upright figures in the distance which he assumed, at first, to be two people, until he realized they appeared to be covered with dark fur. He also noticed that their arms seemed to be noticeably long and he got the impression that they were rather large.He observed them for about 8 to 10 minutes as they walked  around, apparently looking at the ground the whole time. They were were totally unaware that he was watching them.  Eventually it dawned on the witness that they were probably bigfoots. He had a small camera in his pack but he was so caught up in what he was seeing that he didn't think to take it out.  Due to the distance of these figures the camera would not have gotten very good photos anyway. After several minutes of watching them he decided to make a coyote call to see what would happen.   When he did this the figures did not appear to look around before they moved quickly out of his view, down into a large canyon. The sighting occurred in the summer of 2007. In the summer of  2008 the witness drove back to the Sierras from his home in Georgia hoping to see these animals again and get some photos. He did not see them but did find piece of month-old scat that he though might belong to these animals. The scat sample has not been analyzed, but he says it contains hair from small mammals and some finely chewed vegetation, including some type of red berries.",
