I was goofing around and making tree knocks every 15 minutes or so. I did not expect anything but any time I'm in the woods I try. We were making our way back to the truck and were within 500 yards when I made another set of knocks wich was followed almost immediatly by a very loud and powerfull growl. My daughter immediatly looked at me and said what is that dad. Halving my 5 year old with me made me just want to get her to the truck asap. The power and intensity was really something, it reminded me of passing a snow plow on the road, just the power of it.",
