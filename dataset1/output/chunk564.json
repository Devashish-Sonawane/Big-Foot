The witness stated that the smell was almost overpowering. He said that it was very pungent with \"body odor and fecal smell\" all mixed together. After he noticed the \"other person,\" the witness walked in that direction and spoke to it. Being a police officer, he is trained both to pay attention to details and to respond to stressful situations. When he did not receive a response, he became more concerned and his senses went into full alert.The witness said that it is customary for him during crisis situations to draw his weapon and keep it close to his body without it showing.He described the animal as being dark brown in color. He said that it had a thick, short neck and very broad shoulders. He said it reminded him of \"Darth Vader\" because of the way the animal's neck was attached to its body.The following is a photo of Minnehaha Falls: ",

I have heard coyotes and bobcats and this was not anything like that. (In fact I did hear coyotes howling and yipping later in the evening) I patted my son on the leg and he responded in a whisper that he was awake and he heard it too; we laid there for several minutes and then we heard a whistling noise moving through the swamp around the perimeter of our camp. It was not like a bird it was almost like a human whistling a tune but much louder. The whistling lasted for several minutes. It was long drawn out whistles not just 2 or 3 seconds and then a pause. Another hour or so later I woke up again just in time to see a silhouette pass by the backside of the tent.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to MS over the phone. He was informative and sincere.MS, his 19-year-old son, and his son's friend went camping in the Green Swamp Preserve's West Tract. They traveled along the Florida Trail.  Around 6 pm, they passed through a swamp and came to the edge of a prairie-like area where they decided to stop. I followed their hike on a map and found the location of their camp based on MS's statements. They pitched the tent and started a fire. MS heard coyotes howling several times before turning in.Between 2 am and 3 am, MS was woke by a very loud vocalization he could not easily describe. MS said it sounded like something between a howl, a whoop, and a squawk.His son was already awake and heard it, too. The vocalization came from the direction of the swamp, thirty to fifty yards away.   Not long after, MS and his son heard loud whistling circling the tent, a little closer than the howl. It sounded like someone whistling a tune and went on for almost two minutes. They listened a while longer after it ended, but the area remained quiet so they went back to sleep. The son's friend slept through both incidents.MS woke up again an hour later. He was not sure why. The night started out overcast and dark, but it had cleared by then and the moon was bright.  MS saw a silhouette on the wall of the tent as something passed by.The silhouette was as tall as the tent, but MS did not know how far away the figure was so could not estimate the height. The silhouette was not clear enough to discern any characteristics, other than the figure was upright and not on all fours.  They did not stay a second night.The BFRO has investigated many reports from in and around the Green Swamp, including Reports 26823, 22074, 28237 and 28200, suggesting this region is active.",
