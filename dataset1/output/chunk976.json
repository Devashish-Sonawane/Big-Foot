            "Observed": "On this particular morning I am confident to report that I had a sighting of Sasquatch. I am a forest worker and build and mantain trails for a living. In the past decade I have had plenty of encounters of the 4 legged species, including cougar and black bear. What I saw this morning was not a black bear (though in my mind I kept hoping it was). I was within 20 ft. of the creature who leaned down under a fir limb to get a better view of me. I had been leveling an area of shale rock trail with my McCloud tool, when I realized that something was slamming rocks together on my right. My usual response is to raise my voice and yell (No bear Go Bear) and with that I usually see a quick flash of black fur and a crashing of brush. Not this time! So I picked up a lage rock yelled with more force and tossed the rock. By this time I had started slowly stepping backwards towards the Suburban, I did not take my eyes of the spot. I thought I saw something move and bent down slightly to get a look at what was moving the fir limb on the tree. I then noticed a movement of dark brown( a leg) and then a face. My adrenalin coursed, I threw my tools in the back of the rig and drove to the other side of the forest where the rest of the crew was working. They are the only ones I trust with this. Being a woman working in the woods, I get teased enough and I do not want to be the laughing stock among the rest of the employees. They returned to the sight with me and even though they did'nt see anything they felt too spooked to stay. So all 3 of us left the area.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken with the witness on several occasions and have visited the location of the sighting.The witness has a unique opportunity to experience sasquatch behavior because her job puts her in the perfect habitat.  Part of the trail maintenance aspects of her job require that she hit her metal implements on rock.  On occasion she will hear responding wood knocks as she is repairing trails with her tools.Here is another recent incident the witness reported from August 2007: I am very happy to report that Tues. while at work something happened. I had just finished running a saw on the trail, clearing small cedar trees. What I noticed about the trees were they were apparently pushed over. The reason I say this is that the taller trees in the area were defiantly not affected by the wind and snow. These were pushed over into the trail, as if to block it. And they were not there 4 wks ago. I took off my helmet and started walking back to the truck to refill on gas when, that old familiar feeling swept over me.As I came around a curve in the trail I heard what I would describe as jaw popping. I am very in tune with that because one of my wolves would do that when she was stressed. At this point I assumed it was a bear.  The only sign I had seen was week old bear scat and deer tracks.As I started down the slight slope the noise moved closer into my left, and it became obvious that it was not jaw popping but very weak wood knocks. Not a rhythm that a woodpecker produces.  Still I remained strangely calm and curious. I continued past the reservoir to the truck and when I dropped the tailgate I received 2 sharp loud knocks coming from the other side to my right across the water. Now I got excited and promptly took my axe handle out of the truck and found a good stout tree and replied myself with 2 knocks. It got unusually quiet, no planes, all the birds stopped except one lone raven who broke out in alert mode. The raven was across the reservoir and I could see it in the top of a tree ( approx. 90 ft.) tall. It kept making racket so I went to sit down in the truck and take my lunch break. No sooner did I start to eat, the raven stopped and everything else was still dead quiet.Then just in the shadows of the larger trees right below the raven I heard 5 loud knocks and just as quickly 3 weaker ones still coming from my left. I had one on each side of me. I truly felt that I was separating adult from young. I continued to stay calm and went back up the trail to a point in front of the truck where either could cross to reach each other and put 2 peaches high on a stump. I knew I was being watched, but I didn't feel threatened. I returned to the truck to eat what was left of my lunch and keep an eye on the fruit. About 10 min. passed and nothing. Then when I walked to the tailgate the brush and trees on the left came alive and when I reached the side to look over the ravine all I could see was a vine maple swinging. I  felt instantly that a juvenile was creeping up the back side and I startled it. If only I had stayed in the truck a little longer. I went back and raked the section in front of the truck, knowing I was being watched, but everything relaxed and the birds started their chatter again. I walked away from the experience feeling that on a certain level I am no longer a threat. the lady who runs the chainsaw and then leaves us fruit.I went back Wed. morning and the fruit was gone. I didn't find any noticeable tracks other that brush flattened. But I also see that with bear.We will continue to monitor this area as our witness has more experiences.",

            "Observed": "While serving in the Marine Corps I was stationed at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on the USS Carl Vinson. We went to Ft. Lewis Washington to conduct some day and night patrols. I remember the exact day because we listened to the Mike Tyson fight on the radio earlier in the day while in the field where he bit off Holyfields ear. While at Ft. Lewis during a night patrol we got off of the path we were supposed to be on and ended up in some deep brush that was thick and hard to get through. I was the point man on the patrol and carrying a SAW which is a fully automatic machine gun and it was loaded with blanks. While busting through the brush I encountered something that was very big and shaped like you would think bigfoot would be shaped but only saw it in the dark with no lights except for the moon. This large thing and myself were within probably ten feet of each other and it scared us so badly that I opened fire on it with the SAW and the blank rounds to run it off. It ran through the brush on two legs taking huge steps each time and busted through the brush like it was nothing and disappeared over the hill in seconds. Ever since this day I have always known that it was a bigfoot that I saw that day. This was in 1997 before computers and google so I had heard rumors afterwards that Washington was a hot spot for bigfoots. I never knew until now when I ran into this website that there is more sightings of bigfoot in that area than anywhere else in the US. I googled to see what county Ft. Lewis was in and was very surprised when reading through the stories from that county that there was several other sightings on the base such as mine. I don't tell many people this story unless they talk about bigfoot first because as you know most people who have not encountered something like this themselves will not believe you anyways.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I initially contacted the witness via e-mail. After coordinating a time to talk, I called him on the phone. He currently lives in West Virginia. He is in the Army National Guard, and almost ready to retire. He was in the Marine Corps when he had his encounter.I asked him to re-tell of that night when he had his encounter. It was around midnight. His team was conducting a night land navigation exercise. They were at that moment lost. The brush was heavy and they were brush-busting their way through it without light. Having hunted Fort Lewis, I know how thick the brush can be. It had to be very tough going. The witness was walking \u0093Point\u0094 when suddenly in the moonlight he realized that there was a very tall, human-like figure standing about 10-15 feet in front of him. He was so shocked and instantly frightened that he fired-off a long burst of blanks from his M249 Squad Automatic Weapon at the figure. The figure reacted by running away very fast down the hill on two legs. The witness said that no human could run that fast through that thick brush in the dark. He described the creature as human-like, but very large. He estimated it to be 7 feet tall. He said that it had no neck, and that the head blended into the shoulders. The next two or three Marines behind him also saw it.I asked if he remembered where on Ft. Lewis (now JBLM) this occurred. He said that he had only been on Ft. Lewis that one time, and being dark, he had no idea where they were exactly.Ft. Lewis is very large. It is also not accessible to civilians unless one obtains a recreational permit. Since the witness does not remember exactly where it was, and since it was 19 years ago, there is no need to attempt a site investigation. Sasquatch reports are very common on the base. ",
