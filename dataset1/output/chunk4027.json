            "Observed.1  ": "Cinnamon Bair    In other parts of the world he is known as Sasquatch, Big Foot, the Yeti.  Some say he's an animal. Others, a type of man-beast. Many doubt he exists. Some have no doubt that he does. The Seminoles call him Esti Capcaki, but most Floridians know him as \"the Skunk Ape.\" And he's sparked imaginations and debate for nearly two centuries. \"Florida's list of sightings nearly rivals that of the Pacific Northwest, where Bigfoot/Sasquatch has beguiled explorers and researchers since the early 19th century,\" Michael Newton wrote in \"Florida's Unexpected Wildlife.\" Skunk ape sightings in Florida date to 1818 when Apalachicola residents reported seeing \"a 5-foot-tall 'baboon,' pursuing it to a makeshift nest amid cotton bales stored on the north side of town,\" Newton wrote. Since that time, more than 350 skunk ape encounters have been reported throughout the state, including an estimated 10 encounters in Polk County. What is the beast? Accounts vary, but witnesses usually describe an abnormally tall creature resembling a baboon, covered in hair and carrying with it a stupefyingly putrid smell. \"It's this skunk like stink that gives the skunk ape its name, although old-timers in rural areas often refer to it as 'swamp monkey,'\" Charlie Carlson wrote in \"Weird Florida.\" In 1947, for instance, a large primate was reported in a Lakeland backyard. \"The lone witness, a boy four years old at the time, saw a hairy ape-like beast standing among some orange trees behind his home,\" Newton wrote. \"Twenty years later, memories of the event were clear enough to persuade researcher John Green of the witness's sincerity.\" Other reports are more substantial. In 1975, for instance, one Polk County man reported seeing a skunk ape carrying an armload of corn along a road. It was one of three skunk ape sightings reported in Polk that year, according to a statewide database maintained at www.skunkapefloridasbigfoot.com. Far more recently, Jennifer Ward of Polk County reported seeing a skunk ape along a rural Polk road not long after Hurricane Charley struck in 2004. \"I noticed something in the ditch. I looked over, and I guess it noticed me,\" Ward told the Orlando Sentinel that November. \"When he saw me, he was as surprised as I was.\" Scientific evidence of the creature is not known to exist; bones and other remains have never been found, Carlson wrote. Nonetheless, after a spate of shootings at alleged skunk apes in the 1970s - the heyday of creature sightings - a Florida legislator attempted to impose a one-year jail term and $1,000 fine for anyone convicted of killing a skunk ape. The measure, sponsored by Paul Nuckolls (R-Fort Myers), failed when it was introduced in 1976 and again in 1977, Newton wrote. And one Floridian, David Shealy of Collier County, has made a career of the skunk ape. He operates the Skunk Ape Research Headquarters as a type of tourist attraction in Ochopee south of Alligator Alley. [ Cinnamon Bair is a Polk County native.

            "Observed.1  ": "Hughes isn't sure, and authorities are scratching their heads over the reported sighting.  \"He was all covered with hair, a real dark gray color, with some spots that looked a honey color. It was walking on two legs, and it was mighty, mighty, big,\" Hughes said in a phone interview Tuesday.  \"You better believe I was scared. That creature could have tipped that car upside down and thrown it in the ditch. It was that big.\"  Hughes filed a report with the Clark County Sheriff's Department, and a deputy was dispatched to the scene but couldn't find any big footprints, said Capt. Mark Cattanach.  \"We have no goats reported missing, or any other types of small animals that may meet that description,\" Cattanach said Tuesday.  \"I'm not sure what we could do. I don't know that there's ever been any indication, at least that I've been told, that there's any danger to the public.\"  Hughes, 57, was on his newspaper delivery route around 5:15 a.m. March 28 when he said he saw the creature at the side of the road, on County Highway H about 1 1/2 miles from his rural Granton home. At first, he thought it was a man, but as he got closer he said he realized it didn't look human - about 8 feet tall, 500 pounds and hairy with an ape-like face.  After getting a closer look at the creature, which he said appeared to be carrying a goat or small sheep in its hand, Hughes said he floored his gas pedal and quickly drove away.  \"I didn't call it in (to the Sheriff's Department) until the next day, because people would think I'm crazy. And I don't drink, I don't use dope, and I was wide awake,\" Hughes said.  Cattanach said Hughes gave a very detailed description, but without tracks or other evidence suggesting a creature was in the area, there's not much the Sheriff's Department can do. He also said the reported Bigfoot sighting is the talk of the community.  \"There's been a fair amount of joking around with this,\" said Cattanach.
