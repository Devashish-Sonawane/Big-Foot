            "Observed": "It was about 130 in the morning and me and a buddy were driving up to Caroga lake on rt 29 when my headlights caught something crossing the road in the distance. When we got close enough to see whatever it was crossed the guard rail like it wasn\u0092t even there and proceeded to walk into the woods. I couldn\u0092t tell what color it was but it was big we went back the next day and my buddy who is 6\u00922 tried to cross the guard rails and he had trouble doing it so I would have to say it was at least 7 feet tall. Twice around the same area a couple of years apart we heard a loud whirling sound like we\u0092ve never heard before.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to EP over the phone and he didn\u0092t have much to add to this report. He and his friend were driving up Rt 29 A at about 1:30 in the morning next to Caroga Lake, when they spotted a \u0091tall, big, dark figure\u0092 ahead of them which stepped easily over the guard rail and into the adjacent woods. The friend told EP that he thought that it was covered with hair, and the only other feature they saw was that it walked with \u0091swinging arms\u0092. They did not stop the car since both were convinced that what they had seen was a bigfoot, and that they were shaken by the sighting.EP said that he spotted the upright figure from approx 100 yards away in the outskirts of his headlights. Because of the distance, he could not describe any other features.The guard rail, which was estimated to be about 3 \u00bd feet tall, was later visited by EP and his 6-2\u0094 friend, and his friend had difficulty in stepping over the rail as easily as the upright figure. EP stated that he guessed the creature to be over 7ft tall. One side of the road borders Caroga lake, and is interspersed with some swampy areas, creeks and forests. The other side of the road borders the Adirondack Park Preserve, and is heavily forested. The whole area is sparsely populated except for some small housing complexes that border the lake.EP stated that there was a bigfoot sighting near there a couple of years ago. He also stated that he had heard \u0091whoops\u0092 in the area at other times.EP was forthright and did not attempt to embellish what he saw. He remained adamant that what he and his friend witnessed was a bigfoot. ",
