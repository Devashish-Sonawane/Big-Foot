            "Observed": "It was around 4:30 p.m. we were heading back to Lake Tomahawk from Woodruff.  It was sunny but sun was low in the sky,  Forest on each side of the highway, leaves were down with thick undergrowth and thick with pine trees. We saw an all black figure run across the road. It was about 7-8 feet tall and lanky. It took about 5 strides to cross from forest to forest. It ran straight up-- stride effortlessly without stumbling or looking side to side just looked straight ahead. It ran across the road in 3-4 seconds. the sides of the road were at a 40 degree angle to the road bed. It was about 3 football fields in front of us. There was a small red car about 200ft in front of us but it showed no reaction. It did not slow down. We pinpointed where it went in and out the woods and there was no trails or road. You could not tell any features but the head appeared cone shape and long.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The husband and wife were driving southeast on Hwy 47 an hour before sunset when they both saw an upright figure run from west to east across the highway. The husband was driving and was able to provide more detail about the event. He has 42 years of hunting experience and was able to clearly see that the upright figure was running without slowing down or looking down either side of the road. He was bewildered that something that was running \u0093practically as fast as a deer\u0094 crossed the road without stumbling or adjusting its footing. It crossed the 20\u0092 wide shoulder that began 8\u0092 higher than the asphalt road, down to the 30\u0092 wide road, up the 8\u0092 high 20\u0092 wide embankment on the other side and did it with out breaking its stride or pace. Their view of the running subject wasn\u0092t block by the small red car in front of them. The stretch of road was level and straight.Both of them commented how tall and lanky it was and how it reminded them of a tall basketball player. The husband added there aren\u0092t many people that are that tall in northern Wisconsin. He said it moved its arms while it was running but the movement wasn\u0092t exaggerated but was a smooth and a graceful motion. The all black figure had a conical head and there was no shine to the coat.He knows it wasn\u0092t a deer, it wasn\u0092t a bear, and it was running to fast too be a human, he couldn\u0092t say what he saw and was at a loss for words for what he observed.",

My wife, brother, and another friend of ours went packing to Bear Lake in the trinity alps. It was our last night and we were the only ones at the lake. Since it was in August fire wood was scarce and we had none for our last night. We sat in our dark camp until about midnight then everyone wanted to sleep. My brother and our friend shared a tent and my wife and I shared one. I lay in my tent and couldn't sleep. I looked at the time and it was 1:30 am. My wife was asleep and I heard what I thought was my brother walking around in camp. It walked around for at least a minute so I whispered my brothers name to see if it was him but it kept walking around and not responding which made me very nervous.",

There was also an uneasy feeling in camp that evening prior to sundown, described by the witness' brother as a feeling of being watched.The witness woke the rest of the campers by yelling at it and everyone present heard bipedal footfalls as it made a hasty retreat back into the woods.  The witness now has a strong desire to learn more about the Bigfoot phenomenon and has planned a return trip to the area in the spring.The Shasta/Trinity wilderness area of Northern California has a long history of encounters. There are some 40+ reports in the BFRO database from this general area.I found the witness to be sincere, believable and a bit baffled by his experience.",
