            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness via phone. Her recollection of the event is pretty straightforward, and varies very little from the original version provided. As we spoke I got a few other details that tie things together. - This event happened at noon, give or take. - The sound she heard when they first pulled into the parking lot was more like a \"huffing sniffing sound\".- When she realized the walking sticks were still in the car, she went back to get them. The car was parked about 25 yards away from the trail head entrance, and she could still see her companion from where she left him. - When she rejoined her companion, they started down the trail towards a curve in the trail when they \"heard rustling and movement\" about 25 yards away in the woods. They both looked in the direction of the noise and saw quite clearly \"a giant medium chocolate brown creature running through the woods\". It was not a dark chocolate and she noted the differentiation. - \"It was running with it's arms raised up, seemingly protecting itself from the branches slapping at it's face\". The \"hands were black, with no hair on either side\".- It was headed directly towards the curve in the trail they were headed for which was about 25-30 yards from their position. They both saw it, and instantly agreed to get out of there. They kept looking over their shoulders to be sure it was not after them. - At some point a rock or limb was tossed their direction which hastened their departure. The rest of the story she told was as it was written. - After they had time to think about the event after the fact, they were pretty certain they were being paralleled from the car to the event. The time of the sighting was in the 3-5 second range.They knew what they saw and knew what they did NOT see. ",
