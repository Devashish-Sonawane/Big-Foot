            "Follow-Up Report": "The gentleman was traveling south on HWY 407 outside Port St. John around 9PM on a clear bright night. (The full moon had been 5 nights before.) HWY 407 is a two lane road that passes through remote areas and connects HWY 528 with US1. The motorist saw a dark haired creature cross the road left to right about 15 feet in front of his car. The creature appeared to be running, crossed the road in two large steps, never once looking or acknowledging the car\u0092s presence despite being so close to it.What was noticed about the creature was: It ran upright on two legs, was \u0093solidly built \u0096 like a refrigerator,\u0094 and at least 8 feet tall. The shoulders were thick and well-muscled.It had dark hair, with gray mixed in it. (Witness does not think it was headlight reflection.)It had very large feet and extremely long arms that swung and pumped as it ran. It used its long arms for balance when it jumped down from the road, throwing them up in the air \u0093as a kid would.\u0094It had a conical head.Only the profile of the face was seen; also noticed was a human type ear, a flat \u0093gorilla\u0094 noise, and large dark lips. It did not seem to have a lot of facial hair. The witness recently moved from New York City to Florida, and was surprised to encounter the creature. He knew as soon as he saw it, that it was what locals referred to as a Skunk Ape.  I believe he has given a sincere and honest account of what he saw that night.I visited the site where the crossing took place. It is very rugged Florida wetlands and connects to miles of more of the same. It is just east of the St. Johns River, and adjacent to areas where other bigfoot sightings have been reported. This area is non-populated, swampy with Cypress and Palmetto scrub. It has an abundance of wildlife including deer, feral hog and other habitat requirements we have come to associate with bigfoots.Map of the area:",

AS I TURNED ON THE LIGHT IT LOOKED DIECTLY AT ME THEN TURNED TO THE RIGHT AND WALKED BACK INTO THE DARKNESS BEHIND AN OUTBUILDING THAT BLOCKED THE LIGHT. I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I SAW AND TILL NOW I KEEP THINKING I'M GOING NUTS AND IT PROBABLY WAS A HORSE BUT MY HORSES ARE34 INCHES AND UNDER AND IT WAS ON MY SIDE OF A FENCE THAT RAN BEHIND THE SHAPE I SAW THE RAIN MADE IT SORT OF SHINE ON ITS ARM THAT SEEMED TO HANG I'D SAY TO THE KNEE AREA.

Mobile Swamp is actually a very large swamp that covers many miles. The area we explored is exceptionally dense.The witness introduced me to the son of his friend who owns the goats and he related an incident that had happened to him that previous hunting season. He stated he was in an enclosed deer stand in the late afternoon when he began to hear very loud screaming. He said the screaming was coming from further down a game trail that his stand was situated over and as he listened he could tell that whatever was making the vocalizations was moving in his direction. He said that just at the point he thought he would be able to see what was making these noises, the screaming stopped. At this time he had become very nervous and decided to leave the stand before it got dark. He said he'd never heard anything like it before in his life.",
