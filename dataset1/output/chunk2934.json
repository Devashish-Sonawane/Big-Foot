            "Observed": "Me and my mother were in the kitchen washing dishes around 11:30p.m. around thanksgiving 2004. We heard a loud BANG! on the far side of the house . Me and my mother just looked at each other and I said what was that! so we went to the location were we heard the noise and I witnessed ,a BIG shadow larger than a human moving by the window. I estimate aroud 7/1/2 - 8ft ft tall.After the incident I went upstairs and my mother told me the next morning that she felt like she was being watched for about 3 hrs. and was quite unerved by the whole thing.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I visited the witness\u0092s home and spoke with him for approximately 30 min about the event which occurred late on Thanksgiving evening, November 2004. I did not speak to his mother (second witness). He verbally recounted and physically re enacted the incident in good detail and clarity.There is a moderately wooded forest which extends and narrows down and ends within 15 yards of his small 2-story wooden house. He was in the kitchen with his mother and there was background noise due to a running dishwasher.  An \u0091extremely large object\u0092 hit the side of his house in an adjacent ground floor room, closest to the woods. He said it sounded like a car had hit the side of his house. He mentioned that the strength of wall vibration knocked several items off the wall and one of the window sills in the room.He immediately took a few steps into the adjacent, unlit room and noted that an exterior motion sensor light was on.   He did not see any person or animal as he looked out the two windows in the room. The base of the windows are  approximately 3.5 - 4 feet above the ground.  The witness described seeing a very large, upright shadow move quickly away from his house toward the woods.He was somewhat scared by the incident. He did not go outside immediately to further investigate. He went to his second floor bedroom a short time later.  His mother stayed on the ground floor for a couple hours.  There is a single, small living room window that faces the kitchen from which someone outside could easily view into the house relatively unnoticed.  The motion sensor light is not directed against this part of the house.The next day, the witness looked around the house foundation but did not see any footprints in the hardened ground.  Upon further questioning, he revealed that he did not see any large tree branches or rocks next to, or near the exterior walls of the room where the incident took place.  There are no trees with large overhanging branches near the house or any other close objects near the house which could have fallen against the house.  There are two smaller houses nearby which share a common driveway with the witness\u0092s house.  I also interviewed the witness\u0092s aunt, whose experience approximately 5 months earlier is also mentioned in the report.  She lives approximately 1 mile in a northeast direction from the witness\u0092s home and the same tract of land borders the witness\u0092s property. She spends a considerable amount of time outdoors and is highly familiar with the various nocturnal animal sounds of the area, including the sound of coyote, bobcats and fisher cats.  Her bedroom window was open when she awakened by a very loud animal noise that she estimated was one-quarter mile away.  The \u0091screaming\u0092 came from only one direction and was repeated every 15-30 seconds for approximately 10 minutes. She has not heard any other strange vocalizations since this incident.  A sister-in-law living with the witness also recently reported hearing loud animal sounds in the distant after returning home from work about 12:30AM in late November 2005. The witness played several recordings from the BFRO web site and the sister-in-law identified the sound as most closely matching the 1974 clip of whoops and knocks from CA.All three events took place in the town of Moodus, CT.  This region is sparsely populated and is known as the \u0093Catskills of Connecticut\" due to its\u0092 relatively steep rolling hills, populated by deciduous and conifer tress.  There are steep, densely  forested hills immediately adjacent to the witness\u0092s home that are known to contain numerous caves, along with nearby low lying swamp and wetland areas.  Also located immediately proximal to this area is the Salmon River State Forest,which is a large tract of uninhabited land owned by the state of CT.I further interviewed an additional unrelated adult who also lives in the area and owns property bordering Salmon River State Forest.  He reported hearing very loud, unidentifiable screaming sounds during the 2005 summer months coming from the state forest.  The Salmon River and adjacent swampy areas give way to very steep, densely forested hillsides that rise in elevation approximately 400 feet above the trout stocked river.  There are numerous small gorges and mountain streams throughout the region.  Common wildlife includes deer, coyote, bobcats, fox, fishercats and other small game. Native American Indian folklore speaks of the 'Black Fox of Salmon River', an elusive animal that was sometimes seen running away from bow and arrow hunters.",

It was during the last half of the second movie, when we started hearing loud splashing noises coming from the lake, not far from the opening of the barn door, where we were sitting.  My husband asked if I heard that, and I said \"yeah, it is probably fish jumping, or maybe a raccoon or something.\" We continued to watch the movie, still hearing loud splashing noises.  As the splashing continued,  it sounded too big and noisy to be fish jumping.  It sounded like something large walking along the shore.  When the movie was over, my husband went up into the loft of the barn to disconnect the projector and computer.  I stood at the barn entrance,  trying to see out towards the lake and see if I could see anything.  While trying to peer out into the dark,  I suddenly felt very uneasy,  like I was being watched.  The hairs at the back of my neck stood up, and I said to my husband \"I really want to you to come back down here!!\"  Now,  I keep horses at my brother-in-laws place, and I am out there all the time, all hours of the day and night.  I am very familiar with this property and the surrounding area, and have never felt uneasy like that before.",
