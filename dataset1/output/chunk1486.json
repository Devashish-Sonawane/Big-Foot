            "Follow-Up Report": "I briefly met two of the three New York brothers and their uncle on the 2009 Olympic Expedition.  Peter is the submitter of this report and he is the one I did not meet.Mark sent me several clips, including a knocking episode from the morning of May 12th, see video below, turn up speakers and/or put your headphones on to hear the knocks.We also reviewed the video taken later in the day of an upright animal moving between trees, taken on the way back to the base camp location.  The video shows something tall blocking out the background light, bobbing between trees.  The animal apparently also steps into the open and you see what appears to be a lighter colored face.It is extremely hard to make out what you're looking at.  Something is there, but you can barely make it out.  If you have someone pointing the figure out to you, you can see what Mark and Peter are referring to, but without some coaching on where to look, most people would notice nothing.  Please read this BFRO Article, the above-mentioned video clip is included.Also, I have seen the photos of the tracks and they are unfortunately too indistinct to include with this report.Regarding the sasquatch sighting, Peter mentioned, as many witnesses do, the smoothness of the animal's gait and how it glided up an impossibly steep slope, almost as if it was on rails.  He also stressed that he is a recreational climber and knows the effort it takes to move up steep slopes.  The terrain the sasquatch covered so quickly could not have been traversed by a human without clumsily crawling or the use of some good climbing gear.Peter wrote such a detailed, thoughtful report regarding this whole trip, there is very little to add.

On this day May 29th 2002 I left the Black Cloud Trailhead at 7:00am solo. I summited Mt. Elbert at 1:45pm. The weather was perfect and unseasonably warm. There must have been very little snow during the winter because there was very little snow left even at summit. I stayed on top for 10 minutes took pictures with my digital camera.",
