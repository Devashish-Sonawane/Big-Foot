            "Follow-Up Report": "Google Earth image of the area:View Larger MapThe young man was kayaking down a creek, around noon to 3 pm. The creek runs deep in some parts and shallow in others. Coming around a curve in the creek a splash came right in front of him. At first he believed the carp were jumping. Then three more splashes close by. The last appeared to be a rock. Slowing down he started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees much like a person. Upon standing up the creature and witness made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It appeared to be about 7ft tall and weighed around 400 + pounds. It had a shoulder width of about 3 1/2 ft. wide. The hair was a mix of black and gray along the lines of a raccoon. The hair length was approximately 4-5 inches in length; it was matted with mud up to the knees. It had an odor of fish and mildew. The head was conical, with an almost flat nose. The right hand that was wrapping around the tree as the creature was playing peek-a-boo was black. It appeared to be very stocky with little to no neck. After it was done watching the kayaker it turned and started running west through the woods. The witness stated that he is an avid coon hunter and has heard people walk through the woods. This did not bother to go around brush, it just went through it. After the encounter the young man had enough and paddled back to his truck. He returned that night to see if he could \u0093spotlight\u0094 it. After a while he thought he would try a howl, no response, at first. Then two wood knocks were heard. He knocked back and received a knock back from the distance. But nothing was seen.This all takes place next to a wildlife refuge. While coon hunting on the refuge he has heard several different screams that he did not recognize.  ",
