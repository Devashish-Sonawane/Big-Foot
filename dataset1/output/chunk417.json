As my Mom left she reminded me to lock up, so I went to the door to lock it. As I locked the door, I watched my Mom and her friend drive past throught the window on the left side of my door. When I looked out side I noticed the outline of a pair of legs strolling through my neighbors yard. My first thought was that someone wearing adidas pants was going through my neighbor's yard and that some on must be snooping around. Being the nosy person that I am, I cupped my hands on the glass to get a better look. When I did, I saw a large dark redish brown brown figure with long stringy hair, About 8.5' tall. It seemed so musclular and it's legs did not straighten but remained bent. As it walked it swayed it's arms back and forth as I watched in amazement. When I realized it it was something out of the ordinary I panicked and jumped back behind the door. When I looked back it was gone, Moments later the phone rang, it was my Mom on her cellular phone. She sounded very startled when I answered it and automatically ordered me to make sure the dog was in and all the doors and windows locked because she had just seen something very weird. On hearing this I was relieved that I wasn't losing my mind. She said they were almost to the end of my street when a large animal with long reddish brown hair crossed the road in front of them and took one easy step over my neighbors barbed wire fence (mom clarified it was a metal gate) and kept going.",

I was talking to an older guy about bass fishing at an area around my neighborhood known as the Duck Ponds. He said that \"a few years back\" ( with this guy being elderly I wasn't sure how long ago it really was.) That he was fishing at a hidden pond back in the trees. at about 5:30 in the morning when he heard a noise from across the pond. He figured it must be an elk with all the noise it was making. Suddenly he saw two large hands reach between the trees and part the trees like someone would part a curtin.  Then, he said , it proceeded to walk straight across the pond, and through to the other side. I figured (at the time ) He was just jerking my chain. So I played along with agreeing with what ever he said. After my sighting I now believe him.",
