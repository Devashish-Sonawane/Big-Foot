            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke over the phone with the witness, a Deputy Fire Marshal who grew up on a family owned, 360-acre dairy ranch just outside of Drain, Oregon.   His childhood was spent with his older cousin roaming the countryside around the family property on which his mother has lived since 1930 and continues to with his father. The witness has been a hunter since boyhood and is familiar with the local fauna and the sounds they make.  He has heard cougars vocalize and mentioned how rare that is.  The witness was watching a show about bigfoot on the History Channel when BFRO.net was mentioned, so he visited the web site.  He came across the Snohomish recording which struck a nerve and thought instantly, \u0093That\u0092s IT!\u0094  The shiver it sent up his spine prompted him to send in the report.  Over the years, he has attempted to describe the vocals he and his family heard that night.  He shared a quick, funny anecdote about coming within twenty yards of a grizzly without realizing it until the bear announced itself with a growl and a huff.  When his girlfriend asked what had made the noise he said, \u0093 A bear: we got to get out of here.\u0094 What he was thinking was, \u0093That\u0092s not IT.\u0094  I found it amusing that he had an encounter with a big bear and almost instantly thought of the vocalization from all those years ago. On a summer evening in 1977 the witness (age: 12) and his older cousin (age: 17) were walking home after playing in a hayfield until dusk.  The distance between the two is three quarters of a mile.  About half way there they were both startled by a loud whooping.  They paused to listen and after the second whoop began to run.  The quality of the sound, \u0094made the blood run cold\u0085.IT was disturbing\u0085the feeling was instinctual\u0085I\u0092ve never run so fast in my life.\u0094 The vocalizing continued until they were inside the house.There they eventually convinced his \u0093incredulous parents\u0094 to step outside to listen to the vocals. Until that point the couple had supplied the young men with every possible explanation for the noise...cougar, elk etc. The witness explained to them that it sounded like a gibbon he had both seen on TV\u0092s Mutual of Omaha\u0092s Wild Kingdom and heard at the zoo.  Once outside, all was quiet. He remembers distinctly his father standing and listening until he said, \u0093I\u0092ve had enough.\u0094 Just as he turned to go inside, the whooping began again and continued for some time.  \u0093That really disturbed my mother and that isn\u0092t easy; she\u0092s an old farm gal.\u0094  She walked inside and while the animal continued to call, an old high school friend and trapper for the county.  She told him that \u0093something was out here and he needed to come and check it out.\u0094After the vocals stopped, his cousin wished to go home but did not care to walk, despite the fact that it was only across the road, so he called his parents for a ride.  Because they refused, the witness\u0092 father drove the teenager home in his pickup. The two boys did not venture from the farm for weeks following this event.  Nothing was found by the trapper who arrived three days later.The vocalizations were five to eight seconds long with a pause of ten to fifteen seconds between them.  Those on the first night lasted over a half hour, possibly longer. The witness reports that everyone could easily tell where the sound originated and all four were impressed; no one present had heard anything like it, before or since. \u0093It was not from a small animal.\u0094  The vocalizations continued the following two nights lasting up to, or over an hour per episode from the same spot on the mountain near some old growth firs that are no longer there. The witness states, \u0093 I got the impression that it was looking for a response and didn't get one and moved on, or that it was announcing its presence.\u0094I found this witness credible. I believe the vocals\u0092 timbre and volume described are consistent with other alleged sasquatch vocals. ",
