            "Observed": "I have talked to others who have heard or have seen what may be a Bigfoot. While talking to a fisherman he told me in 2000 that many people were hearing cries around the Scioto River. While along the river I have heard the same cries. It sounded like it was calling out another creature. The cries echoed up the river for about a 1/4 mile. The spring of that same year while walking around Lake White just north of a residential area I saw what I believe to be a Bigfoot. It seemed to be a younger one but just as tall. It appeared more manlike than ape-like. I could not believe my eyes so I bent down to get a better look as it moved rapidly behind a tree. As I looked it peeked from around the tree and looked at me. My mind said this is what they call a Bigfoot. As it moved so did the deer that were right behind me. I bolted and so did the deer. I think it was hunting the deer and the deer knew this. When I walked by the deer they stood still, then I saw the Bigfoot. The deer seemed confused on which direction to run away. This creature seemed to move very stealthlike like a kung fu like movement all in one motion. It seemed very smart and not afraid of me. It seems these animals travel the waterways as we do roads.",

Possibly an adolescent??  - He made the report because of reading Report #4964",

I was a member of an airborne infantry unit designated as a \"Long Range Surveillance Detachment.\"  In brief the unit's mission was to deploy 4-6 man teams onto a battlefield and conduct surveillance operations of enemy supply lines and troop movement corridoors. During that month the unit deployed my platoon into a drop zone known as Merril Drop Zone around 0300 a.m.The platoon's teams were to conduct surveillance operations of predesignated road intersections for a 48 hour period then link up together at the area known as Cat Lake in the South Rainer training area. From there we were to walk back to the barracks. All went as planned until the link up date.",

There is a \"stench\" to the area that could be similar to the reported smell of bigfoot, but is most likely due to the constant decay of the wet wood. No \"smell\" was apparent that night other then the decay, which is present still to this day (I have been back several times now).",
