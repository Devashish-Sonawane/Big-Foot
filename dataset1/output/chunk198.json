A Tennessee State Trooper was driving and I was shotgun. The two men in the back were asleep. Suddenly, right out of nowhere, (with only our headlights for illumination), a tall, huge \u0093black form\u0094 rushed from the right edge of the roadway and came toward us, (in a perpendicular path as if to cross the highway). It was so quick that the driver had no reaction time whatsoever!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "NC and three friends were heading south past Live Oak at approximately 1 am and later confirmed with one of the friends that they were on US 129. They were in a 1970's era Monte Carlo pulling a Coleman camper filled with diving equipment. NC estimated the equipment weighed between 800 and 1000 lbs.The road was a two lane highway with wide shoulders. Both sides were forested. There were no dwellings or street lights in the area so it was very dark even though the weather was clear.NC was a passenger in the front. The driver was a Tennessee State Trooper. The owner of the car and another individual were asleep in the back seat. NC said the headlights suddenly picked up something huge and black coming at them from the right side of the road. It looked to be running on two feet and hunched over \"like someone does when they are running full out\". It was taller than the car.He believes it was already in motion when they saw it. The car passed before it reached them and it ran into the camper behind.NC said the impact with the camper shifted the car, waking the individuals in the back seat. Through the side mirror, he saw the taillights of the trailer go up off the ground before it crashed down again.They immediately stopped and backed up. There was nothing laying on the road or alongside it. They got out to inspect the camper. There was no sign of impact, nothing was dented or broken. They did not see blood or hair on the camper or the road.NC said that he is familiar with bears and both he and the driver agreed it did not look like one. The individuals in the back were sleeping at the time of impact so did not see anything.NC has not had contact with the driver for many years and believes he has since retired from the force. He is going to try to locate him and give him my email address if he agrees to talk to me.",
