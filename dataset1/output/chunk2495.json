            "Observed": "Hello BFRO I have something I would like to share with you I believe I have see what people and myself call bigfoot . The first time was on a night time coon hunt. I hunt coons with traps and dogs yet I don't kill them. I let my dogs tree them and I go on to another track with my dog . I had hunted this bottom a night before and my dog was hot on a track deep in the woods bawlen the whole track when he shut up and not a sound from him for twenty minutes. Then all the sudden he came up the creek with his tail between his legs looking back and came straight to me. Ok first this is a hound who has never ran anything but coons and has never stopped tracking with out treeing, anyway, so I thought maybe he got spooked by a bobcat or something so I loaded him up and went home not thinking anything about it. The next evening on the 12th I pulled into the same open field in a bottom where two creeks join. I shined my lights of my truck along the trees of the creeks to see if I could spot some coon and low and behold I saw what I believe was a bigfoot in my head lights at about 75 yards was a enormous blackish brown figure was walking toward the trees through the field to the creek it stopped for a brief moment and just stared at me like it was looking right at me and took large lengthy steps into the woods. I was startled and not only was I startled but my hound in my back seat was startled as well whining and whimpering. I know what me and my hound saw and my dog hasn't ever backed down from an animal as long as I've had it and I've spent countless of hours in the timber with him.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness via phone. I also went to the site to meet him the next day. He was very matter of fact and was adamant that this was no bear, period. The chances of there even being a bear in that area are remote at best anyway. Coincidentally, I was in that exact location two days before checking out another report, and I am quite familiar with the land. This area is also within five miles of an ongoing habituation (visitation) that I have been working on for the past year. As stated, he had been there the night before running his dogs and they were treeing coons. This is a preserve area and no hunting is allowed, so he was just putting them through their paces. They had acted very strangely, howling like mad, then becoming silent and eventually running back to him in a submissive state. He did mention he thought they may have been spooked by a bobcat (other big cats have been reported in the area as well). He did hear some \"loud splashing\" and could not think of what animal could be making that loud of a noise. He did not think too much about it and he left. The next night he went back, and as he pulled up, he kept his lights on and slowly turned his truck to scan the woods to check for \"critters\". He saw a huge figure, at least 7ft tall, walking from the open field towards the treeline. It took a \"step or two\" stopped, looked back at him, then turned and walked into the woods with larger, more hurried steps than it had been taking before. It was gone in 2-3 more steps. He estimated it's size as at least 300lbs (he weighs 250 and that was his guideline). It was very muscular. It walked \"kinda funny\" but could not offer anything else as far as gait or arm/body ratios. At the very moment he was watching it disappear into the woods, the sheriffs showed up, shined their lights, and told him he needed to leave the area immediately. He was apparently on a private farm field. His entire sighting lasted no more than 10 seconds. The witness is an avid outdoorsman, running coon dogs for his entire life, and the bloodline of his dogs is considered one of the best in the country. They are bred to tree certain animals, especially bears and cats, so for them to come back cowering was unusual. He would swear on his dogs what he saw was no bear. We walked to an area across the creek from where he saw the creature. See photos:He had taken photos of the prints he found when he returned, but they were taken in the dark, with a cell phone camera, and they were unusable. When I arrived, we went to the road where he found them. They were gone. He described them as \"very large\" and the placement would have the creature walking diagonally across the road, in the opposite direction from the previous night's sighting.They were no more than large wet splotches, and there was no trace of them whatsoever. It is a well traveled asphalt road, and the traffic, along with the windy conditions, would have destroyed whatever traces there were.The sighting was at the edge of a large plowed wheat field, and it was bordered on three sides by woods. The woods are broken by a big creek, with steep, almost vertical banks, at least 10 feet high. The terrain has large rocky bluffs, deep creeks, heavy woods, plenty of game,and would be an ideal habitat for an alpha predator.   ",

I estimated its height to be over 7 1/2 feet tall because of a stop sign that it was standing next to and in 2 large bounds it cleared the road and was in the stream area. I have heard of reports of tree knocks and growls in this area for the past couple of years. And since my sighting my wife and I have even smelled wet animal sulfur smell coming near our home in Toms Brook, VA just 3 miles from my sighting several nights over the past couple months. Our dogs refuse to go near the edge of our property at night when we take them out before we go to bed too.",
