            "Follow-Up Report": "On January 21,2005, I called SY in Nevada, and we went over his first encounter along Highway 101 in Northern California, on a weekend in April 2003.  Late 2003, SY turned in two reports to the BFRO, but due to military duties he left for the Far East before we could talk.  This is the first of his two reports, and he resubmitted this one in January 2005. His second report was in the same area, but it occurred in May of 2003, and that report number is Report #7504.SY had a very short visual encounter with an unknown creature as it crossed the road in front of his pick-up truck, and he could only see it from the waist up.  The only parts of this creature he could see, was its coned head, its backside down to the waist, and one arm, during his very brief encounter. He first thought, it might have been a person, but he knew it wasn\u0092t a bear. The creature was moving across that highway at what he thought was a fast clip as it was headed for the eel river. The witness almost hit it with his truck, and stated that he was looking for a place to fish, which is why he was only driving about thirty-five miles per hour.  When he looked back onto the road in front of his truck he noticed this creature moving across in front of him, and then quickly disappearing into the foliage on the riverside of the road. Note; he almost hit this creature.He, SY, did go back and located several footprints on the riverside of the road.  He used his eleven and a half size boots as a measuring instrument, and one of the prints with visible toes, was three to four inches longer than his boot and about two to three inches wider.  SY said the creature might have been running, because of the length of its stride, but couldn\u0092t be sure, because of the total time of the sighting, which was about three to four seconds at most.The witness described the creature\u0092s color as gray to dark black; the approximate height and weight were stated in his report. But, SY said that after he returned this trip, he had a friend who is 6\u00927\u0094 tall, and weighs over 266lbs. stand in front of his truck; and he was not even close to the size and weight of this creature.  The creature never looked back at him, so no facial descriptions.  The word traps that was used in the report was meant to describe the trapezius muscles between its ears and its shoulders, and their size was why there was no visible sign of a neck.   SY said he noticed the arm length was longer and much better muscled, than a normal person would have been.  The creature's biceps had to be well over twenty inches around, and this was noticed, because SY is into bodybuilding, and power lifting. Summary: After talking with SY, I am convinced that he had a short encounter with a sasquatch, because of his descriptions of the creature, and his now apprehensive demeanor as he goes over the retelling of his first sighting. Note; SY has had a total of two sightings. (See report # 7504) The reason that apprehensive was used, is the fact that SY is not real sure that anybody out here really believes him, because of how his family and friends have acted after they have heard those stories.  He is not too happy about this situation, because he knows what he saw, and it was real. He still thinks about these sightings every day, and he now has a need to prove to his friends and wife that they are real.  Note; SY did not have a camera with him during this first sighting. I would like to expand on the location of occurrence, because SY is not exactly sure just where on the Avenue of Giants (Hwy. 254) this took place.  So, I am taking this opportunity to expand that area from Redcrest, Calif., down to Miranda, Calif.   If and when SY returns to the area this spring, maybe he will advise as to a closer location. ",
