            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness by telephone on June 3. He was enthusiastic about sharing his experience.The witness has a professional position in his area and has a second job at a golf course. The golf course is approximately 1.5 miles from a state forest and sits on a lake. On May 24, 2014 around 7: 00 am, the witness was at the golf course talking with a coworker. The weather was clear and sunny. The coworker was facing the witness and had his back to the wooded, brushy area on the border of the golf course. The witness noticed a bipedal figure behind his coworker. The witness estimated that the figure was around 7 feet tall. It was covered in reddish-tan hair. The figure was too far away for the witness to see its facial features or the texture and length of the hair. The figure was walking quietly in the brush, approximately 10 feet in, walking with a long stride and traveling east. The sighting lasted approximately 20 seconds. The coworker did not observe the figure - the witness was too shocked to say anything to him. The witness also described an experience he had in the summer of 2012. He lives about one mile from the golf course. Around 10:00 pm that evening, he went outside to turn off a spigot. He heard a growl from approximately 10 feet from the spigot. He said it did not sound like any other animals he was familiar with in the area such as dogs, wolves, or bears. He said he had an oddly calm feeling and continued to walk towards the spigot to turn it off.The witness' professional position occasionally puts him in contact with the Native American population in the area. He said the tribe members have told him many stories that describe something like a sasquatch.I believe this witness is credible. He is an avid outdoorsman and knows the area very well.",
