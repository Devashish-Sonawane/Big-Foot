            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke at length with the witness and her husband via telephone.  The witnesses are both professionals involved in the health-care industry, and seemed to be very detailed, specific and credible.  The witnesses were embarking on a backpacking trip to Mirror Lake in the Eagle's Nest Wilderness area, which is approximately 14 miles from the Surprise Trailhead.  The trail to the objective passes several mountain lakes, and the described incidents took place just past or at Surprise Lake, which is about 4 miles from the Surprise Trailhead.The witnesses described hearing a threatening growl from the tree-line just past Surprise Lake.  Combined with an unexpectedly large depth of snow on the trail, the sound caused them to decide to go back to Surprise Lake to make camp for the night.  They heard wood-knocking from the lake area as they approached to make camp.After arriving at the north end of the lake, where there was a flat area to make camp, they heard several instances of wood knocking or \"rock-clacking\" first from the NW, then from several directions.  The sounds became un-nerving, but they did attempt to create similar noises by throwing rocks together, which yielded responses from the woods around them.The primary witness also sighted a large, apparently upright, hair-covered animal moving through the timber on the opposite side of the lake (appr .25 miles distant).  Shortly after that, the knocking sounds NW of their camp caused them to briefly look uphill from the campsite area, and see another hair covered animal swaying back and forth, seemingly playing \"peek a boo\" from behind a large tree and embankment about 75 feet away to the NW of their campsite.  They were able to make out the creature's face, and upper body, describing reddish/auburn hair, large shoulders and pronounced brow-line and nose.  She shared the blurry photo they were able to capture with a sport camera. You can see what appears to be the brown \"face\" in the center left between tree branches, just off of the white snow pile.  You can see what she is describing, but unfortunately due to the quality we can not state whether they did or did not capture the image of a Bigfoot. Our readers should have the option to view what the witness attempted to capture.  So often times witnesses are criticized and questioned as to why they did not at least try to take a photo.  Here is the photo:They decided to spend the night in the area in spite of the disturbing events due to the approach of nightfall.  During the night, the husband continued to hear wood knocking sounds around the camp, but the wife took allergy medicine that caused her to sleep soundly.  After rising early the next morning and immediately breaking camp, no other incidents occurred.  The couple left the area and went back to their car forthwith.They related that there were no other cars at the trailhead when arriving and leaving, and they had only run into a pair of young girls hiking through, near Surprise Lake earlier that day.  There was no other sign of people in the area.  They also mentioned that they had food stored in an area nearby but separate from their campsite during the night, but it was not disturbed.I was impressed with the detail they were able to recall, along with the cohesion between their individual accounts.  I believe that they were involved in an encounter with more than one Sasquatch, and that the area they were in may be have been in some way perceived to be a territory to be defended by the creatures they encountered.I was planning to make a backpacking trip to this area during the 2014 summer to survey and attempt to collect further evidence but unfortunately I have not been able to due to all the rain the area has received since May.

The animal was around 8-ft tall. When it stepped over the fence, it put one hand on top of a fence post to steady itself and stepped over. The distance to the animal upon first sight was around 75 yards. At the closest point, the witness and animal were within 20 yards. Our witness has hunted the very woods where the animal came from. He remembered seeing tee-pee like structures in the area. On his next trip to Carroll County, we will inspect the sighting location and surrounding woods. It appears to be within the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area boundary.I asked the witness:\u0095 Could you see the bottom of the feet while it walked away?He stated the feet had no hair covering and lighter than the rest of the body.\u0095 Can you describe it in relation to a human athlete? The best comparison would be a tall pro football player, not stocky like a weightlifter.He stated at no time did the animal seem worried or rushed to get away from him. It walked smoothly away, into the morning fog. The total time of visibility was a bit less than two minutes. He considered using his cell phone camera to photograph it, however by the time it was ready the creature looked like a stump in the distance, with nothing to provide a size scale around it. ",
