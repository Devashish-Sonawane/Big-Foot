Later while hunting we climbed up a small hill and I spotted something behind a large tree stump. I didn't say anything and the other witness pointed it out immediately too. We left the woods then.",

They have been here many times and this is not the first time they saw something unusual. This area of the Green Swamp is rich with reports of unusual, hairy upright animals. The other witness was the witness' father. He too saw the animal crouched down behind the stump. It was too far to make out details, but it was reddish brown, and big. I hiked the area they saw the animal in the following weekend. There is a thickly wooded, swampy area about 200 yards on the left into the trail. Lots of big cypress trees with much shade and cover. Several, well used game trails coming in and out of the area. As I was coming out of the forest I noticed many hunters with dogs flushing game out of the woods. Rifle season had just opened. This area is abundant with deer and hogs. Any further investigation of this area will have to be done after hunting season closes. ",
