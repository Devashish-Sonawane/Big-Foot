Our backyard butted up against woods as well as an old railroad track that had long since stopped being used.  We were not supposed to go near the edge of the yard bordered by the old RR tracks, but being kids this is exactly where we were playing when all three of us witnessed the most amazing (and at the time probably the scariest) thing we had ever seen.",

Its hair was dark brown and matted in parts. The face had an element of suprise and not malice.The color and texture of the facial exposed skin was much like that on a dog's snout- black and rough.She said it appeared to be over seven feet tall and very broad. The arms appeared long and hung to its knees. She recalled a musty odor associated with marsh and bottomlands.Barnwell is still as rural today as it was in 1978. The Salkehatchie River runs nearby as well as numerous creeks and tributaries in this rolling landscape.In the Midwest and Eastern states, sightings and track finds often occur near railroad beds -- usually abandoned railroad beds, but not always. It is suspected that bigfoots may sometimes use abandonned railroad beds at night to walk to habitation/feeding areas near those routes.",
