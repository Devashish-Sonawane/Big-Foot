I estimate the time to be around 5 PM. As I approached a left curve I noticed a large dark mass in the road way. At this point I was within one hundred yards of it. Suddenly it moved to my right and in about three steps it was on the shoulder of the road facing me. It was a bipedal creature approximately nine feet tall with a shoulder span approaching four feet with the most intense yellow-green eyes I've ever seen spaced six to eight inches apart. In my headlights I could see it was covered in grey-brown hair. The face was ape like with dark brown-black leathery skin. The creature lifted its left arm, possibly to shield its eyes or perhaps anticipating being hit as I was about thirty feet from it. Then I was past it. It took several seconds for the significance of what had occurred to sink in.",
