It sounded almost identical to some supposed bigfoot screams that have been recorded over the years. It sounded like a combination of a man yelling, a woman screaming and a dinosaur roaring all wrapped into one sound. It went on for maybe 30 seconds and abruptly ended. It was a very unnerving noise.",

The screams where back to back, with virtually no pause between them.--Couldn't tell the distance of the screamer, but could tell that the animal making the noise was large due to the volume.  --Witness stayed alert and aware the rest of the night, but nothing else happened that night nor the rest of the trip.",
