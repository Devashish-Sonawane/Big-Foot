            "Observed": "I had parked my Volkswagen beetle at the junction of Rte. 17A and the Appalachian Trail, intending to camp out overnite along the trail.  I then hiked south on the trail about 4 miles, along a ridge that overlooks Greenwood Lake until I was perhaps just above the New Jersey line.  Since I had hiked this section of trail before I knew of an ideal camping site - a large outcropping of bedrock that rises about 10 feet above the surrounding terrain, and has a sheer drop off on the west side with a small swampy area on that side.  I unrolled my sleeping bag and bedded down as soon as it got dark, enjoying the magnificent view of the sky before dozing off.  About midnight I awoke for some unknown reason, and shortly after heard the most horrifying high pitched scream I had ever heard out in the woods, perhaps a 100 yards to my southeast.  I scrambled out of my sleeping bag, and quickly put my boots on.  Then the scream repeated itself, and I was positively terrified, as I knew it was miles in the dark to my car, and I had only a small flashlight.  Thinking to scare off, what I assumed was an animal, I screamed back at it, and was aghast when it returned my scream.  Several more screams were exchanged and then silence.  With my heart racing, I gathered up all the stones I could find in depressions in the rock I was camping on, and began throwing them in the direction the loud scream originated.  Then, to my horror, another scream came from a direction south-southwest of me, which astonished me as I heard no noise of movement, and in those days had extremely good hearing.  I hurled rocks in this direction, with more screams being exchanged.  This process went on for another hour, and then quiet, but I stayed up all night.  In the morning I checked the area where the noise had originated, and discovered it was covered with dry leaves, which made me more puzzled why I heard no noise.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After cutting down and blocking six dead trees and loading most into his truck, the witness caught the scent of something very foul.  He said the smell reminded him of when he had been \"lambing,\" and the smell when a sheep gave birth to a dead lamb, one which had died days before the birth.  The odor of that was so foul it made him feel like vomiting, and the smell associated with his sighting was similarly bad.  He said he didn't understand why the smell would suddenly be present and it made him look around.  In doing that he saw a creature just 100 feet away with its back to him, heading on two legs up a slope.  When I asked if it could have been a man or a bear he said no, that it was a bigfoot, that there was no question about it.  He described the creature's ascent up the slope as seeming labored, like the animal \"was an old man,\" and said at one point the creature put its hand out to support itself on a tree.The witness said the creature gave no indication that it was aware of his presence but said that it must have known he was there.  The man saw only the creature's backside and never its face, since it didn't turn to look at him while he watched it.  He thought the animal was at least six feet tall and said it was covered with brown fur.  After watching it a short time the witness got into his truck.  He said the experience frightened him, and that he had thought if he ever saw a bigfoot he would follow it, but that any such idea \"went out the window\" when he found himself out there, alone, and looking at one.  In fact, he said he stopped watching the animal even before it was out of sight because he was worried that if the creature turned and saw him looking at it that it could become angry.  The witness had seen the Patterson/Gimlin bigfoot film when he was young and thought the creature he saw was lighter in color and more slender than the creature in the film.The witness is a fifty-year-old man.  He works for a logging company and is an experienced big game hunter and so he has spent a good deal of time in the mountains of Idaho.  I talked to him twice by phone and he impressed me as a normal, hard working, and truthful fellow who saw something extraordinary - a bigfoot.  Nothing he said during my interviews with him made me think he was being anything but honest and his primary concern seemed to be to tell his experience to someone who would take it seriously.  The witness and his story were very convincing.",
