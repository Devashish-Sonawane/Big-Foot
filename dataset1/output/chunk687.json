            "Observed": "On Sunday June 2, 2013, a friend of mine at the time wanted to explore some logging roads in our area and get some pictures of his jeep in action. We started out exploring many of the roads in the area, and as we travelled down one road we encountered a tree that had fallen across the road but was lodged in the trees tops on the other side of the road. We were able to drive under it after we determined that it seemed safe from falling and blocking us in. We drove a short distance further and went through a sharp right turn and found another tree across the road the same way. So we decided to back up a few feet and take a smaller side road and turn around. Once we were on the side road we decide it may be a good road to check out, however we wanted to walk up the road to make sure we could turn around, or see if we could tell how far up it went. The road was smaller than the previous we were on, and neither of us had any previous knowledge of this area.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I called this witness on 6/1/15. I asked him to recount the events from his report, which he did. In further discussing events, he mentioned hearing vocalizations that were suspicious from the woods south of his home. They were described as yelling sounds. It was moving away rapidly. He also provided a photo of what he thought might be a sasquatch.We agreed to meet him on Sunday 6/7/15 at his home.When we met him, it was helpful to see the lay of the land where he lives. He lives along a highway that runs east-west. To the south is the Tilton River, which is a tributary of the Cowlitz River. This area is well known for many reports of sasquatch sightings. I asked him what time of year they most often hear strange vocalizations. He said that it was usually in the late summer or early fall.  He also mentioned that they have an electric fence that runs near an apple tree. On two occasions, the fence was ripped-down at that location. Whatever ripped-down the fence also bent the rebar that was supporting the fence. He felt that the fence being ripped-down was connected to the apple tree, which at that time of year would have ripe apples. Upon further questioning he and his wife described what they call a very strong \u0093wet \u0091possum\u0094 smell at night.The place that is the subject of this report is just a few miles north of his home. We drove to the location. This place is in national forest land. The road is a well maintained USFS road. We drove up hill through numerous clear-cuts and stands of timber of varying ages. Several miles in, we came to an intersection with another road. He said that where they were was straight-ahead, and he was surprised to find a new gate there. It had been two years since he had been back there, as he was really apprehensive about going there alone. He remarked that the location had changed in appearance due to some road construction and the new gate. We parked at the gate, and went on-foot past the gate and down the road for about one mile. He found the location, but was surprised that all the brush along the road had been cut down. It appeared to me that the Forest Service was preparing the area further down the road to be logged. There was fairly fresh flagging tape here and there. The witness walked us through the events, describing the wood knocks and tree-limb breaking that they heard. We looked around and took some pictures. I scanned the area often with my FLIR thermal camera. We heard no wood-knocks, vocalizations, or other sounds that sasquatches make. I saw no heat signatures. It should be noted that it was a very warm day, and I was not surprised to see nothing moving. After seeing all that we wanted, we returned to my vehicle and then to his house.One thing to note is that the terrain looked different from the photo mentioned above. A couple of weeks later, he contacted the BFRO and asked that I call him, which I did. He confessed that he was mistaken as to the location where the photo was taken. He said that it was actually taken from south of his home near to where they heard the vocalizations. This is an honest mistake in my opinion. The photo is not clear enough to make out anything other than a dark brown mass, which could just as easily be a stump or root-ball as a sasquatch. It is inconclusive.It is usual to not find any evidence at the scene, especially when the report is two years old. However, as often happens with reports from people who live in rural areas of Washington, once an investigator starts asking questions, then more information comes out. In this case, it is the vocalizations from south of his home, and the fence broken down. This witness heard what is very likely sasquatch vocalizations. What he described to me was very similar to what I recorded at night a few years ago from a road overlooking a tree farm south of Yelm, Washington. The tree farm is off-limits to the public after dark, but we found a road where it was permitted to park at the gate and walk-in at the time. I recorded about 20 instances of what I could only conclude was a sasquatch yelling, \u0093Heyyy!\u0094 from a direction and distance that put it in an area where there are no people at night. Here is a link to that recording. Note that the vocalization was coming from well within the Vail Tree Farm. This property is closed to the public except during hunting season. This was recorded in the spring: (Audio Clip)The description of the wood-knocks accompanied by a very loud tree branch break is consistent with what other investigators and witnesses have reported. I have heard this myself on several occasions. I conclude that this witness just happened to turn the jeep around where several sasquatches were at that time.",

            "Observed": "My family resides close to Norman, Oklahoma, and from 1976 to the present, there have been numerous incidents revolving around Bigfoot, including two sightings in 1976 and one in January 2003, footprints in both mud and snow, several incidents where vocalization was heard, and numerous other accounts of stones being thrown, foul odor being smelled, fruit being taken off of trees, etc. Back in 1976, Bigfoot researcher Bob Stamps and his partner took several plaster casts of footprints and interviewed family members who had heard and seen the creature. The most recent sighting happened in January of this year. My 61-year old brother-in-law was chopping wood and breaking kindling approximately 40 feet from his house near the edge of the woods. It was early evening and he was just about to finish when he happened to look up and caught the sight of the creature out of the corner of his eye. At that point, the creature was approximately 15-18 feet away from him, standing in enough of a clearing so that he could see him from the waist up (due to thick underbrush he could not see any further down). He estimated the creature to be 7-8 feet tall with a slight hunch.  He froze for a minute and then dropped the wood that was in his hands and ran inside of the house. By the time he entered the house he was visibly shaken and according to my sister, he was \"as white as a ghost.\" The hair on his arms were standing on end caused by physical reaction of goosebumps due to the state he was in. He was having difficulty breathing and therefore was having a hard time speaking. All he could say was \"Buh...buh...buh...\" My sister and niece thought he was having a heart attack and were fearing for his life. When he was finally able to calm down, all he could get out was \"Bigfoot.  I just saw Bigfoot.\"",
