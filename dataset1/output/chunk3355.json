            "Observed": "My sister, her husband and I were driving home from Bartlet lake after some night fishing.  It was around 12:30 a.m.  We were on a dirt road with tall embankments on either side.  My sister was driving slow and we were both looking at my bro-in-law while he told a joke.  Out of the corner of my eye I spotted something in the middle of the road. About 50 yards away in our head lights I turned and saw it!  I have never seen one before but somehow I immediately knew what I was looking at.  It WAS a bigfoot.  It was around 7 feet tall. Walked up-right.  Cow red.  Long straggly dirty hair.  It was acclimated for the desert because his hair was very thin not thick like a bear.  It didn't seem to pay us no mind as he crossed the road in only a few strides.  What sticks out in my mind the most is how it got up the steep embankment with no effort. It just walked right over it. The sighting only lasted a few seconds but seemed to go in slow motion.  I always thought that bigfoot was a hoax.  For me seeing is believing.  I am a true believer now because I DID see it.  I feel very fortunate for this experience.",

This a rare sighting in that it occurs during the hot time of the year in a desert location although night time temperatures can drop significantly.  There is a year 'round water supply to support wildlife with the Verde River flowing into Bartlett Lake.  This location is also just west of the Mazatzal Mountains, an area with a history of reports.A few details to summarize and add to the report:-Interesting comment about the hair being red or what may be called sorrel also long and thin, not like a bears fur giving the witness a feeling that it was acclimated to the desert location.-The witness felt the biped was a male with no apparent breasts and a tall slender build.-The gait was smooth and swift, crossed up and over the embankment in 2 or 3 effortless steps.",
