Our Neighborhood \u0093Kelly Edition\u0094 is a large, lush, neighborhood on the outskirts of town just separated from the country side by the next neighborhood, \u0093Westridge\u0094. Behind both neighborhoods lie two small reservoirs side by side. The reservoirs are surrounded by a creek which snakes through the town and leads out into the country side. This provides a very dense tree line around the reservoirs but one can easily cross over from the neighborhood to the reservoir with just a quick hop across the small creek. In other words, our neighborhood is very close to bodies of water in a commonly dry country side.",

It wasn't uncommon for deer, raccoons, and other animals of the country side to wander in towards the edge of town to drink from the creek or reservoirs. This one particular day, my father and I awoke early in the morning to leave for Fremont, it was barely light out, still dark. Birds were chirping and singly beautifully as they do in the morning dawn, but then suddenly we heard it\u0085 From what seemed to come from the creek and reservoirs area was an eerie cry that sounded like a sick cow. This cry so primal and terrifying it made the hair on the back of both of our necks stand strait up with fear. Instantly the birds were mostly quiet, their singing replaced by the sound of every dog with in a mile radius, barking wildly at the top of its lungs. My father, a veteran hunter of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Ohio had never heard anything like this before in his life. We tried not to think about it and made sure all the doors on our house were locked before driving off to Fremont. Years later now, I am visiting your website and listening to sound clips of Bigfoot. And one made my heart stop, it was the exact same scream we heard so long ago.",

So I started breaking preparing for a deer to jump out but instead a full leg then body came out and stepped in my sight into the road..as I looked I realized it was a bigfoot creature about 8 foot tall covered in long brown fur, very thin. It did not look at me but took the road in two more steps and was across and gone into the woods beside a home's driveway..it happened so quick it was surreal .All I could do was look at my daughter whose face was in total shock..she started saying .oh my god mom that was really a bigfoot..I cant believe we just saw an actual bigfoot..",
