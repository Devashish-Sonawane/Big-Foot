I waited ten minutes for my luggage, then left the station to take CR42 West to Lady Lake. It was between 4 and 4:30 pm while I was driving that I noticed something running on someone's farm land. There were cows gathered in a pasture near the house. The creature was running in their direction but at a long even stride. I was probably about 150 yds away on the highway. It was brown/black in color and was the same all over. The stride was long, maybe about 3 1/2 to 4 ft. between steps. The creature looked at least 6' ft tall. It was the first thing I thought of as it was on two legs and all the other animals were on four. It looked out of place. No one else was around as far as I could see. The creature was running along the fence line. Which should be mentioned is that CR42 runs the southern edge of the Ocala National Forest where sightings have been seen. On Sept. 4th I had to pick up tickets in Deland for a trip. I took the same road but passed the farm because of traffic behind me. I wanted to photograph the area but couldn't.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness no longer lives in Florida, so I spoke to her on the phone several times. On August 15, 2014 around 4:30 PM, she was heading west on Hwy 42 from Deland toward Lady Lake. West of the St. Johns River and near the small town of Paisley she noticed \u0093something out of place,\u0094 from the road. Interactive MyTopo map of the areaWhile passing, what appeared to be a structure surrounded by a cow pasture, was a dark bipedal figure running along the outside of the pasture. What struck her about it being out of place was that the figure seemed larger than a human, was running very fast, and that the figure was uniform in color thus appearing to be without clothes. She could see the strides were long and smooth. She claims, \u0093It just didn\u0092t run like a man would.\u0094 It was running along the fence line toward the road, coming from the south, heading north. The witness drew a photo of what she saw - She estimates the figure was maybe less then a football field away, yet could tell it was much taller than the fence. From the speed of the creature and the angle, it appeared to her that the creature\u0092s intent was to cross the road. This sighting is in the Lake Mack area and just to the north of this road is the Ocala National Forest where there have been many reports including Report 34954 and report 31153.

We came out of the lead at about 3:00AM and started gathering our caving gear together for the 1/2 mile walk to the car. As we are about to leave the strangest call I have ever heard came from the opposite side of the sink from us. Distance would have been about 900'. The three of us have been woodsmen all our lives but none of us had ever heard a call like that. It sounded like four different animals in one. All powered by what must have been an enormous set of lungs! Hearing the vocalization the three of us looked at each other saucer eyed not saying a word. Each of us was hoping the others would pipe up with a logical explanation for what we had heard. Needless to say since we had been planning to leave anyway we beat a hasty retreat to the vehicles.",
