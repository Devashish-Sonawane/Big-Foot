So, my squad was over on top of a hill ridge over looking saddle.  We were waiting for the enemy to come up the hill so we could engage them, but then we heard a noise from behind so we turned around to see what what it was. We thought it was a bear about ten yards but it seemed like it was taking a knee so we stared at it for about a minute then it got up onto its feet and started walking to our position and we did nothing as it walked between our fighting holes which were about 15 feet apart. As it passed by us, it knew that we were there because it didn't keep his eyes off of us, he  looked down at me directly as it passed by then he stopped about 15 feet away, and turned around, but not completely, he turned at his waist to a look back and disappeared. It was big, at least 7 feet tall.  I mean his body was muscular. It was the biggest thing I had ever seen",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke in length with the witness by telephone and  he was able to provide a few more details:The creature was on one knee to the right of his position, and near the other dug in (fox hole) positions near his location.  He said he had a friend that used to play football and he is about 6' 7\" tall, and this animal was considerably larger.It stood up on two legs, and just continued to look at him and his partner as it started walking between the two foxholes and started down the hill.  He said it was not moving very fast at all, but calm and confident, \"like he owned the place\".  He said it was covered in very thick dark brown/black hair and when it turned to look back at them its whole upper body would move instead of just the neck and head.  They were able to get a good look at the creature because there was a full moon and the creature was in a clearing near their foxholes.There were four other witnesses, his partner in the fox hole with him, his Sergeant and two other Marines, who were in the other foxholes.  After the incident, all who saw it discussed it and no one knew what it was. Also noted was an unusual smell, he couldn't really describe it, but could only say that it was very strong.This witness told me he had been out of the Marine Corps for the past 2 years, and was recounting what he saw - I did ask about the others, but he was not sure how to get in contact with them.  But, he told me if he ever did, he would have them contact us.In my five years of doing this research, he was one of my better phone interviews - I do believe what he saw was real, he was fairly adamant about it.  Hopefully, the others will see his report on our website and come forward with some more details.",
