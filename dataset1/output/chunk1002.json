            "Observed": "I am having a house built and I had the drain field all dug up for the septic system installation. I was walking around in the dug up area just checking things out and looking for more remains that belonged to the deer skull we found when digging. I found some big tracks in the dirt. The dirt was loose in places but I still barely made a print with my shoes. The prints were pretty big and I only found a few. Maybe three to be exact. They looked like a human print with a big toe and smaller toes and shaped just like human. I took some pictures of the prints but I made the mistake of not putting something next to the print to gauge its size. I don\u0092t think anyone would have walked out there barefoot and if they had, they had some tremendous feet. The tracks had to be 14 inches long. The pics aren\u0092t great because it had rained before I took them. But you can still make out the print.",

The second vocalization heard by the wife was that of mumblings.  She said it sounded like more than one individual talking and she described it as when you're camping and can hear your neighbors talking but cannot make out words.
