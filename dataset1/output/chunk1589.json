After several questions it is possible that it was two screams from two animals in the same location. All six witnesses live in the area and are familiar with the local animals. Cougar and Linx have been seen in the vincinity. Their community is right on the border of a National forest. Until the night of the vocalization they were all pretty sure they knew the local habitat. After the vocalization they were not so sure. I spoke with three of the six witnesses and found them to be open and honest about their experience. They want to know what it was that made that call. I assured them that we do too.Click the image below for a larger version.",
