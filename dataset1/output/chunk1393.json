One person said that when he was younger (mid 1970's) and on a week long horseback trip in the primitive area of the Uintas some \"thing\" started making loud noises late one night after they had gone to bed like the noise that I had described.  He called it a \"Wild Banchee\" and said that they didn't get a wink of sleep that night.  He said that it was circling the camp screaming, roaring, shaking trees, throwing rocks, and broken limbs.  He mentioned that he and his brother sat huddled in the tent while his dad stayed focused on the direction of the circling noises with he pistol at the ready.  He said the horses were tied and hobbled and they were going crazy.  He said that the noises stopped a little while before sunrise.  At first light they packed up and got out of there.  I vaguely recall he mentioned that this happened up in the Redcastle area.",

I have only a couple comments to add to this report.He is an avid hunter and outdoorsman familiar with native animal sounds who has spent considerable time in this area and in the wilderness in general.  Having heard just this one sound so many years ago and with his return visits with nothing to report doesn't diminish the impact this one incident had on him. He felt it was a perhaps a lucky occurrence to have heard it.  He sought to identify the sound which lead him to the alleged bigfoot recordings on this website. ",
