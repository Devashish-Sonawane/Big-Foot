            "Observed.1  ": "Egg, but some new ones coming out of an  area just seven miles northeast of the main  crossroads may just take the cake. Multiple witnesses now claim to have seen  something that can only be described as a  monster roaming the woods and swamps  between downtown Two Egg and the  Chattahoochee River. While the accounts  vary somewhat, the strange creature can  best be described as a \"mini\" Bigfoot. Two accounts that have come to our attention  here at www.twoeggfla.com both originate  from within one mile of each other, although  both are independent and with no connection  between the witnesses. The first eyewitness described hearing a  noise outside his home late at night. Going  outside to investigate, he says he was  stunned to see \"something upright, running  away on two legs.\" The creature or monster  was of about normal human height and was  pale in color. According to the witness, it ran  into a marshy area and could be heard  splashing away through a pond. An investigation of the area the next morning  revealed tracks leading straight down  through the mud into the pond, but it was  impossible to determine what might have left  them. They were not human footprints, but  were too large for a deer or other similar  animal. The soft, wet mud had obscured too  much of their appearance to determine much  more. The second sighting took place about three- fourths of a mile southwest of the first one  and near the intersection of Circle Hill and  Oak Grove Roads. An eyewitness saw a  small upright creature with long hair running  away through a marshy area. It was smaller  than average human height, but was running  on two legs. The individual relating the story  to our website described it as a \"hobbit\" or  \"mini\" Bigfoot. The sightings have prompted a great deal of  speculation in the area, where strange  howlings are often heard in the night. Some  are calling it the \"North Parramore Hobbit,\"  although the most popular term seems to be  the \"Two Egg Stump Jumper.\" It is worth noting that tales of small bigfoot  like creatures are not exactly new in Florida.  Residents of South and Central Florida have  been reporting an animal they call the \"skunk  ape\" for years. They are, however, very new to  the Two Egg area. Most residents take the stories with a bit of  tongue in cheek, but the witnesses very  plainly believe they saw something out of the  ordinary. \"I got a really strange feeling that I  was seeing something that wasn't supposed  to be there,\" said one. As the water level, which is near flood stage,  begins to drop, there are plans for a small  expedition into some of the area's swamps  to see if tracks or any other indication of the  creature's identity can be found. If you have similar such reports or any  information on what the \"Two Egg Stump  Jumper\" could be, please drop us an email.",
