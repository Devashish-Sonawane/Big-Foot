Additional details were that he heard three separate \"throaty growls\" from the upper part of the mountain. He was followed, with the animal stopping when he stopped and moving when he did. He found the experience very highly unnerving. He now is not comfortable in the woods after dark, though he does still hunt. He has lived in the area for many years and is familiar with the surrounding area. Cornfield Sink, Northfield Sink, and Pettyjohn Cave are in the area where his occurance happened. There is a history of sightings and unexplained animal noises in this area.",
