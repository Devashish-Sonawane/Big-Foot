            "Observed": "Monday August 31 2009 was the 3rd day of Colorado\u0092s archery elk season.  The day before I was hunting a familiar ridge and noticed a remote looking hanging valley across from the ridge I was hunting and decided that if I didn\u0092t get into any elk that afternoon I would try to get into the hanging valley early the next morning. Monday morning I started out before light. By 6:30 I was climbing up a steep elk trail through a patch of very thick forest. I remember thinking that I had never been in this area before despite the fact that I had hunted this unit for over a decade and that this patch of forest was as close to \u0093old growth\u0094 as I had ever seen in central Colorado.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After over four hours of discussions in three phone interviews, I am confident in the word, ability and judgment of this witness. John M. is 44 years old and an avid outdoorsman who has been regularly backpacking and hunting since 1983, and primarily concentrated in the same area of this report where he and his hunting partners have taken 8 elk in the last 11 years. While there have been many various reported observations over the years which have led to the consideration and growing assumption by many researchers of possible wood-knocking attributed to sasquatch, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first report claiming to have observed such behavior but, because of the detail provided in this submission, not much in the way of additional information was obtained.In the initial approach immediately after his calling, John estimates that the then-assumed elk loudly and quickly approached from a distance of about 100 yards to 30 yards in about 10 seconds, remaining just out of sight and in the nearest thick cover, although brief and fleeting glimpses of movement were seen a few times along the way as stated. He estimated that the entire duration of the later knocking incident was approximately 25-30 minutes.Although he did not look closely, because he was not yet considering anything unusual, no particular tracks were noticed around the wallows due to the mostly grassy surrounding ground, as apparent in a picture taken by his partner of the first wallow and provided during our conversations.After this incident and upon returning to his campsite, John found that his three hunting partners had left the area. When asked about this, he explained that he had expected that two of them may have left already but was a bit surprised to find that his primary hunting partner had also gone, although it was at the end of their intended stay and they had not necessarily agreed otherwise. He spent the night alone at the campsite, which was a considerable distance from the specific location of this incident, and contacted his partner the following day upon his return to Vail. That partner returned the following weekend for a closer look and was easily able to find the location described in part because he had left several red flagging markers along the way marking his trail.While, like most people, the witness was somewhat aware of the subject of bigfoot, he had no particular interest or belief in it and did not seriously consider its possible presence in Colorado. Because of this encounter, he is now personally convinced of the reality of this creature and intends on continuing his own study. \"I'm certain enough that I want to pursue it. Before this happened, there's no way you would have convinced me to spend $600 on some trailcams to go hunt bigfoot.\"The witness desires to keep the location undisclosed so as not to generate any additional attention and pressure to his preferred hunting grounds but mainly because he now intends to attempt further research efforts of his own in this specific location in this regard. An on-site visit with John and his partner and a few BFRO researchers is intended this coming summer and a cooperative relationship is expected.This location is near the Flat Tops Wilderness which has been the subject of several previous reports and investigative efforts by current Colorado BFRO members. As such, we have confidence in the area generally as to its suitability as a potential habitat area for these creatures. David Petti",

We parked at ********* road and walked down to the water which took about 10 min. As he was preparing to fish ( I am not really into fishing) I was looking around. I noticed that the fish were jumping so there was a good bit of water splashing, but I heard what sounded like someone running through the water in a shallow area. I asked him what it was but he didn't know and we thought it was just the fish. Then around 10 I saw something moving around in the swamp area (the same area where the wading sounds were coming from. In a split second I saw what appeared to be a large man with rasta type hair. I called for my boyfreind but \"the man\" was already disapearing through the woods. He did happen to see the branches moving though. I asked him what that was but he couldn't tell.",
