            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.  She stated that she and her father were driving back home from their cabin near Alpena.  They were traveling a back road between Fairview and Mio.  She was approaching a stop sign and traveling slow at approximately 20 MPH. The witness looked to to her left and spotted the animal standing off the road standing between two pine trees that were spaced several feet apart.  She slammed on the brakes and the animal quickly turned and walked away.  She stated the animal quickly vanished in the trees.  She estimates the distance from the car to the animal at around 100 feet.She described the animal as very tall, around 8the feet.  It had blackish/ grey hair which she described as long and draping.Her father did not see it, although he could tell she seen something that caused her to become frightened.  The encounter is in an area of numerous other reports and not far from the 2011 BFRO Michigan expedition.  It is in the Huron National forest and is home to an abundance of food sources, lakes, creeks, rivers and heavily wooded forest.",
