            "Follow-Up Report": "A telephone interview and on-site visit was conducted during this investigation. During our time with the witnesses, no issues of credibility or misidentification were noted.Some items of note from our time at the property included:-There was a remnant of the handprint that had been cleaned but not totally erased.  This print was at a height of 8' 6\" from ground level.  A Deputy had visited the property earlier in the day and taken print samples, his analysis was they were not human. A BFRO forensic expert determined that the cleaning had smudged the print to a degree that did not give him sufficient detail to make a conclusive evaluation.-The top of the window in which the dark outline of the creature was observed measures 9 feet from the ground. The witness reported the shadow seemed to be leaning over and it did move when she turned off the TV.-There was an evident line of travel that came from a hollow and ran between a fence and a tree line. The weeds were smashed down at intervals ranging from two to four feet with the trail ending right behind the house, although the fence and tree line continue along the back property line for another 100 yards or more.-We discovered that something had attempted to pull apart the dog run on the property, leaving a three inch gap where the most pressure was applied. A two inch diameter galvanized steel post was buckled in this attempt, with the crush point being one inch high and a figure eight steel bracket being displaced two inches as a result of something pulling at the corner of the dog run. In our attempt to recreate this at another corner of the pen, and in a conversation with a local vendor of a similar product, it is evident that extraordinary force was needed to create such damage. The witness was adamant that he inspected the dog enclosure at the time of purchase, and during installation, and the damage did not exist at that time.-Photographic monitoring devices were installed but results to date are inconclusive.Above- The windows where the alleged shadow was looking into the family room. The tops of the windows are nine feet off the ground.Above- A view from the inside. Notice the coffee table aquarium. It appears the shadow was quite interested in the aquarium probably due to the light being on and the rest of the room being dark.",

Going up Denton Hill just past the ski area, there was a car in front of me appox. 100 yds. There was lightning to the west of my location but not yet raining where I was at.  The highway going up the hill has a passing lane. The car in front of me was in the driving lane and then swerved into the passing lane as if to miss something. After he swerved I noticed a large black figure beside the road. It was standing upright on the shoulder of the road on my right about to go up a steep incline to the woods. Just saw it for a second then it disapeared. Took a second for me to make out what it was. The car in front of me did not stop or put on it's brake, so  I'm not sure if I really saw something or it was my imagination. Appeared to be appox. 7 to 8 feet tall. using the car as a reference point for height. Total black with long arms and legs.",
