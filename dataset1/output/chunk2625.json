            "Follow-Up Report": "I traveled to the witness's house where he recreated the incident; seeing the sasquatch go from squatting to standing up slowly only twenty yards away from him.  The witness thought someone was outside stealing gas from his truck, so he went outside with a flashlight and a .45 ACP.  He noticed a bush in the side yard that shouldn't be there. As he was looking around his truck he heard movement. The sasquatch slowly stood up to a height later measured as 8 feet. It had a white ring around his face and was reddish brown in color. The flashlight reflected back red eyes. The sasquatch and witness locked gazes. Its arms hung down to its knees. It seemed to have less hair around its face. The witness could not discern ears or a nose. Even though he was armed, the witness did not feel compelled to shoot. Eventually, the sasquatch slowly turned and walked out of the yard past an empty house, and turned up the street out of sight.  On the night of January 8th, the witness reported hearing the \"most awful noise; like the kind you make on the show.\" I shot an azimuth to the area that the noise came from and referenced it with a map. The noise came from a large field in the valley below the witness's house.  The witness seems believable, and his story on the scene was consistent with his report to BFRO.This area warrants further investigation, as the witness states local families have had encounters over the years.Jack pointing to the height of the sasquatch:This picture uses the paint program to show the height of the sasquatch along with the general outline and color described by the witness.",
