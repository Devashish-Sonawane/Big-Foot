            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness by telephone for almost two hours and was impressed. He is a 38 year-old North Carolina police officer who also spent six years with the Florida Game Commission. These experiences have sparked a further interest and study in the subject for him. A few additional notes can be added to his original report. He described the knocks as sounding \"like a guy driving nails, loud and rhythmic, like a guy hammering,\" and \"like somebody taking a 2x4 and hitting a log,\" or possibly like a rock knocking on wood but which seemed too loud for a man to be able to do. He heard about eight to ten knocks for a duration of about six to eight seconds. He also stated that his father had mentioned hearing similar knocks and whoops on prior occasions.After discussing the original report with the witness, he also detailed the additional unusual experiences mentioned above. I thought them sufficiently interesting and asked him to write those in his own words as well, which he did and I add here:\"Here is a little on the other two incidents we spoke of:Late 1980\u0092s (either 88 or 89):Same basic area of the [edited] as the knocks report.  This incident occurred during a mid-October rifle hunt.  Temperatures were mild (40\u0092s), no wind, with light intermittent rain, which stopped by late afternoon.  I was using a hook-on tree stand and watching a clearing (about 100 yards long) among dense pine growth.  The woods were very quite, too quite and I observed no animal movement of any kind that afternoon.  I had the sneaking feeling of being watched. At about 4 PM, I heard what I originally thought was coyotes whooping and howling north of my position (200-300 yards away).  The sounds were loud, overlapping, as if made by numerous sources.  They were moving slowly to the west (my left) over the course of 5-10 minutes.  The sounds then ceased.  I would characterize them as higher pitched, short duration howls that were not quite like a coyote (which tends to scream) and definitely not like a wolf.  This past Fall I listed to some of the recording on the BFRO site and now am really uncertain of what I heard.  The sounds were excited and nagging, almost like a running fight or chase of some type.  At any rate, I sat until near dark and climbed down from the stand.  I walked about 20 yards to the east (my right), to the edge of the clearing.  I was not using a flashlight and it was pretty dark in the surrounding woods.  Just as I entered the tree line, I heard a loud noise just on the other side of the clearing (about 30 yards behind me).  It sounded like a large limb had been broken from the lower portion of a tree.  It startled me so badly, that I spun around and brought my rifle up (thinking bear).  Just after I did this, it sounded as though the \u0093limb\u0094 that had been broken off, was swung through a bush (or other plant material) and impacted loudly and sharply against the base of a tree.  It was close, loud, and highly unusual.  I walked backward most of the way back to our camp.\"From my notes of our discussion, I can add some further details. This location was also near a wet, boggy area. He was distinctly uncomfortable as he had the nagging feeling \"something was watching me\" which was a noticeably unusual feeling for him. He heard the \"loud, ripping, cracking, breaking\" of the tree limb which was then followed by the repeated beating or smashing of trees and brush which made quite a loud and frightening commotion, so much so that he immediately swung his rifle towards the noises and backed out of the area.  He admitted that he found it so unnerving that he was terrified. The howls he heard went in the same direction as the following commotion, except those noises were much closer than the location of the last howl heard.\"This last one (we spoke of) involved my father hunting and camping alone.  He relayed it to me after returning home.  I don\u0092t remember the year, but it was approximately 98 or 99 (maybe 2000).  He decided to camp above the same creek (edited) we usually utilize.  However, he was on the eastern side and just above it on a ridge that parallels the creek (which runs along 30 or so yards away).  He has been hunting that area nearly ever year since the early 70\u0092s and knows it very well.  He is a life-long outdoorsman and knows a great deal about wildlife and animal movement.  He was careful to set his camp away from any game trails.  He said the woods were very quiet, clear, and quite \u0093normal.\u0094  Average temperature during these October hunts is usually in the high 20\u0092s at night (elevation about 9600 feet).  He said he was asleep in his tent in the middle of the night.  He awoke for unknown reasons.  He said as he lay there, something hit his tent three times.  He showed me one time, by slapping the back of his hand against the side of a nylon tent.  He said the point of contact was on the side, near to the top of the tent.  He said the whole tent shook.  He stayed still and quiet and the contact came again; three clear slaps on the side of the tent (same manner and intensity).  It happened again in the same manner and he called out (yaa, git!!) in an attempt to spook away whatever it was.  He said a minute of so went by and again, three more slaps on the tent.  He started hollering and shining his flashlight (he said he thought it might be a bear; I didn\u0092t believe him about that).  He said a few moments went by, and again, there were three slaps on the tent.  He said he turned his light on, unzipped his tent, and cautiously crawled out with his rifle.  He said he looked around, but saw nothing.  He told me the woods were quiet and he never heard footsteps or breathing. I asked him about it over the years and he just blows it off as superstition and just \u0093some animal\u0094 slapping his tent.  He basically refused to talk about it the last time I brought it up.\"Further investigations into this area are intended. The witness also plans to continue his yearly hunts in the same area with an additional interest for further investigations and observations of his own.  David Petti",
