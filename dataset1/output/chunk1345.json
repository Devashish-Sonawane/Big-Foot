            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke at length with the witness by telephone.  He stated that he and the witnesses were around 13 or 14 at the time.  He states he has since talked with the other witness since then and they all remember the same details.    None of the witnesses have any other explanation of what they saw.   The witness is now 38 years old.They were camped with several family members and decided to take a walk, exploring a two track that ran north from their camp.   They came to a part of the two track that ran up a steep hill and when they looked up to the top of the hill, they saw the figure standing at the top, in the middle of the trail.   He described it as massive, with very broad shoulders, Dark brown hair that was a uniform color and long arms that hung down, almost to the knees.   He estimates the height at between 7 and 8 feet tall and the weight around 500 pounds.He stated that they watched it for about 2 minutes and then got scared and turned and ran back to their camp, which was about a quarter mile away.   They did not look back to see what the animal did, but didn't feel it followed them.   This is the only sighting the witness had there, although he returned several times to hunt there over the years.  Upon further trips to hunt the area over the years, the witness stated that a few times he heard strange screams at night that he could not identify as belonging to any animal he knew of.  The area has since been logged and a large forest fire burned several hundred acres just to the north of the location.   I am very familair with the location, as it is not far from my house and I grew up riding dirt bikes in the area. This is a heavily forested area surrounding the clear cut areas and the clear cut areas have a good regrowth.   The area has a large population of deer and other wildlife.",
