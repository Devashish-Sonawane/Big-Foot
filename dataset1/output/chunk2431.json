            "Observed": "In 1987, I was 16.  My parents & I lived in a log house (3 stories) in Waleska, on top of a mountain.  My room was in the basement (it was like my own little apartment!). I kept my window open during summer, to catch the cool breeze at night.  One night, I was trying to go to sleep and heard in the distance a loud howling/moaning/screaming sound.  Really hard to describe.  You would expect bears, bobcats and your occasional wart hog around those parts of the woods, but I had never heard this sound before.  It made me literally sick to my stomach.  I laid there in silence, with my Great Dane, who was also startled by the sound.  About 5 minutes later, I heard heavy steps outside my window.  I then smelt something horrific and heard footsteps on the deck. I felt that whatever it was was looking through my window at that point.  My dog was pretty much under the covers, hiding, with me.  Whatever it was seemed to pace back and forth in front of my window for about 2 or 3 minutes and then it paced off. Later, I heard that same wrenching howl/moan/scream thingy.  At that point, I scurried and closed my window.  Needless to say, I had trouble sleeping and did not ever sleep with my window open!  I have continuously had nightmares about Big Foot even to this day!  It is good to read other stories such as mine.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Even though the events happened long ago, they obviously made a deep impression on this young lady at the time.  While she never saw what came to her window that night, it is difficult to imagine any known animal that could account for the vocalization and the smell she described.  Even though her family did not really take her very seriously when she shared the incident, she remained resolute about what she had experienced.",

            "Observed": "In late October of 1993 my brother and I were deer hunting on a large farm in Piney Flats Tennessee. Piney Flats is located halfway between Bristol and Johnson City. The farm bordered Boone Lake. A lake that had been made in the 1930's and 1940's with the construction by The Tennessee Valley Authority.I had scouted the area the evening before,so I could have an idea of where I would be hunting.I entered the woods well before daylight the next morning. I was hunting with a single shot muzzle loader.I sprayed myself with human scent shield prior to entering the woods.I walked through a high grass field,crossed a barb-wire fence and entered the woods. I walked up a ridge and sat down on top of a large rock facing that was protruding out of the side of the hill. Where I was sitting was directly above the trail that the deer had been traveling.I could see shapes of trees and the outline of the woods against the fence. I began to hear something walking in the high grass of the field to my right.I then heard the barbed-wire cling together as if it something had crossed it.I then heard the leaves begin to crunch and crush underneath steps being taken.I could see something walking in a zig zag pattern below me. The pattern continued but it was slowly walking toward me. I then began to hear the sound of a grunt and low toned growl.As the figure came closer I could make out the shape of a man walking up the hill in a zig zag pattern. As I continued to watch the thought ran through my head that someone had walked upon my spot to hunt and then I realized that the gentleman who owned the farm had only allowed my brother and myself to hunt.The rock I was sitting on was approximatly seven and a half to eight feet off of the ground. This figure was standing five to six feet infront of me but was looking me eye to eye.It grunted and growled in a low tone as if someone who was congested or out of breath.(thats the only way I can describe it)I could make out the shape of hair that was around the head area.I could also distinguish shoulders ,arms and a torso.The shoulders were very wide and no neck was visible.I coughed as if to alert that I was already hunting this spot. The figure continued to stand in front of me and breath heavily.I then waived my hand and coughed again.At this point the figure turned walking back down hill on two legs,swinging its arms and going the same direction it had came from.I observed the figure until it walked out of my sight and hearing range.No one believes me.At one time ,this area was populated with members of the Cherokee Tribe. I have always heard of legends out west by Native Americans but never in this part of the country.I have spoken with one other person who has wittnessed the figure about one mile from where I did.With my encounter I detected no smell, but truth be told I was so astonished I wouldn't know if I had.",
