            "Follow-Up Report": "I had a very interesting and informative discussion with the witness. He is retired military with three tours active duty and is very detail oriented. He is also an avid rifle and bow hunter and quite knowledgeable with all wildlife. His military training came in to play during his event.As mentioned, he and a buddy had been hunting a regular spot, and they were both in full camo gear head to toe. Since it was approaching the end of the day he decided to gather up his stool and other items. He had been sitting on the stool by the hay bales for a good while. As he stood up he saw what he thought was his buddy about 150-175 yards away, walking towards him in a clear area between corn patches. He waited until he got a bit closer as he gathered the rest of his stuff. He called out to his buddy \"Have you seen anything\" and there was no answer so he waited until he was a bit closer. As he saw \"his buddy\" was about 100 yards or so away he was about to call out again when he realized it was NOT his buddy. The creature was walking almost directly at him and it stopped by a hay bale. This was when he also realized it was \"incredibly tall\" and towered over the hay bale by at least 2 feet and perhaps a bit more. Hay bale height (on it's side) is approximately 5 feet. 8 feet minimum in height was a good estimate. He stated that he did not think the creature saw him, but MAY have heard him when he called out. (Conjecture here) He thinks it was just headed his general direction because the heavy timber was behind the hay bales about 100 yards or so. The following is his description after we clarified some details : 8-9 feet in height. \"He was cut\" as in ripped like a body builder. The \"head was kind of high\" was in reference that it was \"more pointed or conical\" and just \"sat on the shoulders with no neck visible\" to him. It had \"very broad shoulders with very muscular arms and legs and the upper torso tapered down to a very slim waist, and it was built like a pro athlete\". \"The arms were longer than normal and were swinging slightly\". \" It walked in silence and it seemed to glide\". He had no sense of fear at this time, and since the creature was still coming his direction, he decided to make sure he was not silhouetted against the hay bales behind him since he would blend in perfectly with the woods since he was heavily camouflaged. He attributed his \"sense of calm and lack of fear\" to his military training. It kept him grounded and also from grabbing his phone for a photo.The creature was still heading towards him at a leisurely pace and was another reason he thinks it had not seen him due to his camo gear, but at this time he decided to err on the side of safety and ran towards his truck. When he got to his truck at the treeline, he saw the creature was getting close so he \"slapped the holy sh..t out of my tailgate to simulate gunfire\". When he did, it reacted and went down \"on all fours and took off running.\"   The entire duration of the sighting was 3-5 minutes. The duration of the event would be another reason the witness was certain the creature did not see him until perhaps the very end when he slapped his tailgate. His camo gear, and the approaching dusk, may have kept him virtually impossible to see as the creature was heading N/NW and into the fading sun.Great solid witness and like many men and women of the woods, he knew what he was looking at and also was he was NOT looking at.
