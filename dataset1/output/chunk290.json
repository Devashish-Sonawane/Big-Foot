I was sitting in the back of the car, we were talking and I just happened to glance over to the right to look at the river when I saw a brown upright figure just walking away from the water's edge. Even though it was a distance away, I could see that it was one color from head to toe and the whole body was evenly shapped like an animal in the distance rather than a person wearing clothing. As I saw it take those couple of steps I could see the arms swing with the motion of the legs. When we arrive at the restaurant I said to my boyfriend that I think I just saw a sasquatch, that it just didn't look like a person. I've been thinking about it ever since.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On October 27, 2012 the witness and her family were driving to Orlando on Hwy 50 from Titusville. It was around 6:30 PM.  The sun set that night an hour later.As they drove over the St John\u0092s River she glanced out the passenger window and noticed a large, dark figure walking away from the water.Google Earth image of the location:It was on the northwest side of the river less than 100 yards from the overpass. What she noticed most was the very obvious arm swing. She is adamant it was not a bear, or a \u0093clothed person\u0094 as the dark brown color was completely uniform and no clothing was visible. She also could tell it was much taller than a human should be. For the few seconds she looked at it, she saw it take several large steps heading in a westerly direction.  Google earth image from the top of the bridge:Photo taken from under the bridge:The arms and legs were very big and muscular. It did not appear to be wet as the witness believes if it had been it would have been \u0093smoother.\u0094  The head was very large.  It did not seem to notice the car (This is a common type of behavior. Many witnesses claim the bigfoot doesn\u0092t even glance at the car even if it is within feet of it.)  It wasn\u0092t until they arrived in Orlando, did the witness tell the others what she saw.  It took her several minutes to \u0093digest\u0094 what she had just seen to be able to discuss it.  She can still recall in vivid detail what she witnessed as it was a \u0093life changing experience.\u0094The sighting occurred a day after Hurricane Sandy passed by offshore the Florida coast. The area was affected by the weather with rain and winds. Upon investigating, I learned that air boaters routinely clean their deer and hog catches near the bridge and discard the carcass there, see photos:The entire area stinks of rotting animals. I presume now, that in addition to scavenging the shoreline the \u0093locals\u0094 are attracted to the carcasses and the other animals drawn to what is left by the hunters. The area is very boggy. Very large alligators and cottonmouths prevented me from retracing its path and looking for footprints.  It has also been noted that sasquatches seem to be more active just after tropical storms and hurricanes.  A week before this possible sighting two sightings were reported less than 5 miles from this one. See Report 36710. The St. John's River is the dividing line for Orange and Brevard county. The figure was on the Orange county side.",
