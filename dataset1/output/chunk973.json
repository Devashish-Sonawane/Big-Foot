Hemlocks and rhododendrons cover the area as well. There were a few others there during their two nights but they had been trickling out due to inclement weather. During their midnight walk, the witness and his friend had noticed a horrible smell thinking it was a dead animal. Moments later, they heard the scream. The scream came from about 100 yards from where they were walking and only lasted a few seconds. He said it was similar to the Ohio howl but was more shrill. Three to five seconds later, six \"fist sized\" rocks were thrown at them and landed around them. The rocks came from the direction of the scream. The witness and his friend were armed and had a flashlight. They noticed no other movement or strange sounds the remainder of the evening. The next morning they left the area.The following May they returned and hiked around and noticed a particular area that made them feel uneasy. They noticed matted down brush as though a large animal had bedded down there previously. The witness currently resides in Florida and is a carpenter by profession. He is an avid hiker and backpacker. ",

I was comeing up to the grange hall turn where there is a connecting road that travels south on the eastern side of the Island. There is a hill at the point of the intersection and I slowed down to the recommended speed because there is a hairpin turn just down the other side.",
