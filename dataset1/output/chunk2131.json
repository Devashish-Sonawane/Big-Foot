            "Observed": "In 1974, I purchased an arce of land in northern CA in a place called California Pines, a very remote area bordered on 3 sides by a national forest (Modoc Nat. Forest).  To get to the property, which was located many miles from civilazation, you had to travel on a very rough road (one cut with a dozer) so our motor home could not make it to our lot. Near by was a small pond and a campsite that was for the use of property owners. The pond was about 75 to 100 feet across, the banks were covered in cat tails and the pond was full of trout (we tried all day to catch some fish, without luck). My family(wife, son and 2 daughters) were aware of how quiet it was in the evening, we could not even get a station on the radio. We built a camp fire and were sitting around it watching the field mice run down to the edge of the pond to get a drink. As I remember it was a bright night, the moon was visible overhead.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Talked with the witness by phone.  He added the following:--Sighting occurred SW of Alturas;--The \"cat purring\" sound was coming from the BF as it was at the water's edge;--He described the BF as 7 1/2 feet tall, 600 pounds, covered in dark brown hair, with a flat face covered in dark brown skin (there was no snout or hair on its face);--Witness also noted that the BF acted very startled by him; when it stood up, it threw its hands up (at shoulder level) in a \"you surprised me\" fashion and screamed \"like a girl.\"  The witness couldn't help but respond back to the BF in the same way (so both through their hands up and yelled).  The witness stated that the BF dropped the fish on the ground, and appeared frustrated because it couldn't decide whether to pick up the fish or leave.  Both of them looked at each other for a moment then went in opposite directions.  The witness later saw the cattails moving again and assumed that the BF came back to retrieve the fish.--When he went back to look at the area that the BF had been, it was at the pond's edge, and the witness had the impression that the BF had been kneeling next to the water fishing (it was bright enough to see the large trout swimming).",
