            "Observed": "In February of 2011 I was traveling down Highway 95 between Potlatch, Idaho, and Tensed, Idaho between 12:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. It was wooded pasture off to the right side of the highway and open grass pasture and creek on the left (drivers side) of the highway. I was driving into a curve before Wiegand Private Road when approximately 40-50 ft in front of me I saw a very large, dark form walk straight across the highway, right to left. I assumed it was a human so I slowed to full stop in the middle of the highway, which was empty both directions except for me. It was at this point that I realized that I could not see this person off the side of the highway or out in the grass pasture to my left. I had my high beams on and the area was very well lit from that.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I texted with the witness at length due to not being able to make a voice call. She was extremely articulate and recalled details to her report she filed over three years ago. I asked the witness about some details of the creatures stride and height. She advised that the creature was about the height of her 80's Suburban and that it was walking upright, arms swinging and it's head was slightly hunched. I asked her about her interest in the subject prior to her sighting and she said she had heard about Sasquatches, but never looked into it. I included a link to one of the articles about the lady who witnessed a Bigfoot chasing deer in the field along Hwy 95.  The lady was watching the Bigfoot in her rearview mirror when she struck one of the deer with her vehicle. The lady reported the accident to the Latah County Sheriff's Office which led to the media articles. Due to the very close proximity to to her own sighting in 2011 the witness decided to report her encounter. https://pullmanradio.com/benewah-county-woman-swears-bigfoot-caused-her-to-crash-on-us95-near-potlatch/I asked the witness about any other incidents or encounters and she relayed the following to me via text and it has been unaltered. \"Well, it's not what I would call a sighting or anything definite like that. But it's been 5 years and I still feel dread when I think about it, as silly as that sounds. So buckle in for a few long messages. I had just moved to Idaho County in 2015 with my husband and our, at the time, infant son and 2 year old daughter. My husband works in the wilderness for a living and I grew up packing and running livestock in the mountains so I'm not easily spooked. I decided that while my husband was away on an assignment I would take the kids up to Jerry Johnson for a day hike. Idk if you've been there but there is a large parking area on the left side of the highway, and you have to go across the highway, cross a pack bridge, and then you hit the trailhead. It's maybe 1.5-2 miles up a pretty gentle trail to the lower and upper springs. I had my double stroller and I also brought my Australian Shepherd with too. For the record, he's passed away since then, but he was the laziest, chillest, most easy going and friendly dog in the world.He was also large for an Aussie, about 75lbs and tall. I always felt pretty safe with him around. Anyway, we got up to the springs and the kids played in the water for some time. At some point my daughter got stung on the finger by a wasp and I was at the stroller wrapping her finger up and my dog went dead still and started growling way down low in his throat. At the same time both my kids started wailing like banshees and I got the most intense feeling of dread I've ever felt in my life. I mean like full on panic and fear. I also happen to be lazy and laid back, so I've never felt that way before. I literally shoved my kids into the stroller, leashed my dog up, and headed back down the trail. I actually was so focused on leaving I left an entire bag of stuff there. The whole way down the trail I felt like I was being watched and followed. It was absolutely dead silent and my dog was basically dragging me and the stroller. I honestly thought we were going to die. But, we made it back to the car and I remember thinking I'd feel alot better once we were safe in my car. But even with the doors locked I was just overwhelmed with this feeling of being observed and followed. It's just over a 2 hour drive home for me from Jerry Johnson and I was scared shitless the entire time. My dog was nervous too. It took him forever to settle down. I spent a lot of time trying to reason it out, like maybe it was a bear or a cougar, but I've had more than a few encounters with animals like that in the woods before. I've been scared and nervous before for sure but never to the point of feeling like we weren't going to make it out of the woods alive. I really started doing some research at that point and I found that numerous people who have and Bigfoot sightings and experiences have felt similarly.  I thought I had been scared with what happened on the highway in Potlatch years ago but it didn't compare to this. I didn't *see* anything at Jerry Johnson but something was WRONG in those woods there. Especially the way everything went silent. Birds and squirrels always alert for predators. Always. It's a hallmark way to tell something is out there is a flurry of noise from prey animals. This was absolutely dead silent. No wind, nothing. Just my kids hollering and my dog growling. And I've been back since then but I refuse to go alone. I've gone back several times with my husband and never felt like anything was strange. It's an amazing little spot to go to, but I won't ever go without him again. So there's that. Idk if it was Sasquatch but a lot of people have reported similar things over time and I just feel in my bones that it's related.\" I was unfamiliar with the Jerry Johnson Hot Springs, but I was easily able to locate it on the map. It is in a very isolated area off of Hwy 12 in Idaho County. Although nothing was actually seen or heard, there were multiple descriptions in the account that are consistent with other reports and was worthy of being included. ",

I have since this incident studied the sasquatch phenomena, and some things I have in the past noted in this area have taken on a new light.

            "Observed": "I was down on the lake target practicing with my rifle. My mother had come along to get out of the house. I was shooting into a mud bank at the edge of a small clearing that has a deep gully running down beside it. I had been there about a week before and had left early because I had been overcome with a sudden dread bordering on terror. I had been unable to explain this at the time, but the events that transpired next seemed to have justified my fear. I had fired several shots to set in my scope while my mother walked down to the lake. I soon had my scope set and followed my mother down to the lake taking my rifle with me. We then decided to walk up to an area  were I wanted to check for deer sign, which is directly across the gully from the car. At this time the sun was just going down on the horizon. We had just reached the area and I was busy looking at the ground for sign when I heard a series of peculiar whistles, at first I thought it might have been a cow but they were to high pitched and had an strange quality to them. As I was listening to this my mother walked over and told me that someone was standing by the car I couldn't see the car for trees from where I was at so I walked over to where she had been standing. I could see the car but couldn't see anyone . I then asked her if she could still see them, thinking she might have mistaken a tree for something else. she told me it was gone. As I said earlier the sun was going down and it was getting dark so we started back down the hill around where the gully terminated and up the dirt road that ran past the clearing where the car was parked. By the time we reached the road it was getting dark enough to be hard to see. There is a lot of brush on the side of the road and we couldn't see very far. As we were going up the hill about 20 yards from the car, the only way I can think of to describe what happened next is to say we hit a wall of smell. It smelled just like an outhouse and was very powerful. About that point I took what my mother had described to me to heart and decided that there was something in the brush in front of us and at the same time began to get extremely scared. I still had my rifle so I fired a couple of shots in the air. No sooner than the echo died away I heard heavy footsteps like the sound of a man running, going away from us towards the car and the gully , these sounds ended with a heavy thud like something jumped off the edge of the gully and landed on the steep bank. We then cautiously made our way to the car. I held my rifle at the ready while my mom got in the car. While this was happening I heard a sound coming from the edge of gully about 15 yards in front of me, it sounded like a cross between a rhythmic grating sound and a human voice. I then got in the car and we drove away. After we drove home my mother described to what she saw in more detail, what she saw is as follows: a tall manlike shape with light from the setting sun !",
