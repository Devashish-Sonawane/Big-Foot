When I was 10 years old, my father decided I was strong enough for a long excursion in the wilderness, and we set off for a place called Seven Lakes near Big Pine. We had hiked for a few days when we came to the sixth lake, and we could see the seventh lake just beyond it. Seventh lake was covered with ice and there was snow all around just past where we decided to camp for the night.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length and felt very confident in the accuracy of his report. I have the following to add:It was late Spring. They had camped at what essentially was the end of the trail; all that was beyond them was a frozen lake and a steep ridgeline. As they were going to sleep a mild snowstorm blew in with pretty strong winds. Both he and his father heard the animal approach from roughly 50 yards away. He describes the footsteps as very heavy \"to such a degree that you could feel the approach\". The animal stopped about 5ft from the tent and stood silently for close to 5 minutes. The reporter said he could \"feel that we weren't welcome there; almost like it was angry at us for being there\". The animal then continued up the path in the direction of the lake and ridgeline. The next morning at first light the two of them packed up and left the area rather quickly. They didn't think to look for prints. Both had/have no idea what they encountered that night but note that whatever it was was clearly bipedal, very large, and traversing an obscure, remote location deep in the night without any light source.
