            "Observed": "My family and myself were in Colorado on vacation. We we going down the Phantom Canyon between Florence and Canon City Colorado. We were probably 5 miles into the canyon when we made a curve in the road and I noticed out the right side of the car several cows standing around and a large black furry thing, kind of bent a little in the knees walking around the cows. He looked maybe 7 to 8 foot tall. He was swinging his arms really fast like he was trying to get away in a hurry.I never saw his face he had his back to me. I was shocked at first and could not really say anything but about 5 minutes later I told my Dad and he turned around and went back to the place where I had saw him. There was nothing there by then except the cows. We drove back a couple of miles and some people were camping but they were packing up to leave. My Mom and Dad did not believe me for a long time, but a few years after that they had went back and had heard that someone else had seen such a thing around Colorado and that something had tried to get into someones house not far from there and had found some fur on their back screen door. This was back in 1985. Noone had ever really believed me but on 8-7-03 I watched a special on Discovery Travel and they had some reachers on there trying to track a Bigfoot sighting in Oklahoma, so I looked up your web page when I got to work today.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "  Interviewed witness by phone, the following comments are added from the interview.It was around 12 p.m. when Tammie, who was riding in the back seat of the family car, saw a large black figure walking on two legs, hunched forward, with long hair covering its body. It was walking  through a field passing by some cows who did not seem concerned with its presence.   It appeared to be heading towards a  treed, rocky area beyond the field.  She was astonished at how the arms were swinging wide and at the long steps it took, but also how  gracefully and quickly it was moving.   Her dad turned the vehicle around to go back, but on return, they saw nothing else. Her mom also saw something dark but only caught a fleeting glimpse from her seat.   Tammie is a stay at home mother. ",

            "Observed": "My 5 year old granddaughter was riding her toy 4 wheeler in our backyard while my wife was sitting reading. She rode to my wife and told her to come see and hurry, my wife walked as fast as she could but by the time she got there whatever it was was gone. When we asked what she saw she described something tall and hairy that was watching her. She said it was brown with hair like grass, taller than her father but, she didn't see any eyes. It had hair that stood up on top of its head. She swears it was not a cow in the pasture next door.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the grandfather of the witness.  The little girl was driving around their yard in a battery powered toy vehicle.  She would drive a while and then stop to talk to her mother or one of her grandparents and then drive on around the yard. Their property is bordered by some thick forest and they have various fruit trees on the property.  According to the grandfather, the girl drove back to her grandmother and was very excited and shouting for her to come see.  When they got back to the spot, nothing was there.  They have questioned the girl about what she saw and do not believe she has confused it with any other animal around the property.  Per the grandfather, she will not go anywhere near the spot where she saw something.  The little girl refers to it as the monster.  When they pressed her as to description, she said it was hairy, taller than her daddy and described the head like a point.  As I was attempting to explain that a Sasquatch is very curious about children, the grandfather told me he was aware that this type of occurrence was common.  He claimed he was not an enthusiast, but is familiar with Sasquatches.  He has attended a few seminars and said Sasquatches have been around this part of Texas all his life.  He knows the vocalizations when he hears them.  He added that his wife has attempted to reassure their granddaughter that she probably saw a mommy and it was just watching her play, the same way she would watch her own children.  I commended the grandparents for their proactive attitude.  I also suggested that the next time the little girl brings it up, they should suggest she draw a picture of what she saw.The grandfather suspects the Sasquatches may return when the fruit trees are once again full.  I asked him to contact me should activity return and if his granddaughter decides to draw a picture of what she saw.  I found the grandparents to be very credible people and as this type of scenario is commonly heard by investigators, I believe the report to be credible as well. ",
