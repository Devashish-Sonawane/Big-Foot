            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness, I have no doubt he is very credible.When asked what the deputy had told him specifically, he replied that a county employee, who was operating a road grader, witnessed a large, bipedal creature step from the woods onto the road he was grading.  At first, he thought it might be a bear, however, as he got closer to the creature, he realized it wasn't a bear. At that point he became so frightened he backed the grader to where his car was parked, got into his car and left. He called the police and reported the incident once he got to a phone.The police went to the location and upon arriving at the grader, found many large footprints around the grader as well as handprints on the cab and body of it.UPDATE:  We were lucky enough to have this witness bring his cast and share his story at a Florida Expedition.  For photos of this cast, see the Expedition notes for Florida Expedition 2006.",

I noticed i have found them along service roads and along trails by power lines. I suspect they are found there for the same reason i am there. Deer hunting. There are also three lakes and multiple creeks in the same area. I was hunting with my wife and i showed her prints and she wanted to leave real quick. I have seen an actual animal when i was in my teens but i lived in Ohio then. People say that I'm crazy but i know these animals are real. The closest thing that i can compare them to are giant orangutangs. I'm not the smartest guy in the world but i know the woods and every animal that lives there. I know what these are and that they are real. I live in Rome, Georgia  and where i find these tracks are near to where i live but i don't tell anyone because of the fear some yahoo would try to hunt them.",
