I almost wonder if they were herding prey for hunting purposes. approx 02 hrs later I heard them again as they moved back into our area.I have heard these noises before and I immediately recognized the sounds as they are so unique.there were 7 people in our tent. 4 teenage girls (my wife myself and our 10 month old son.we all heard them and needless to say the girls and my wife were a little startled.",
