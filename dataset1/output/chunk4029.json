Most reports regarding the creature include the same description: a tall human-like being, averaging 7 feet in height, weighing from 500 to 800 pounds and covered in hair. For the past five days, Sampson has found two sets of  footprints, which he measured at 14 inches and 17inches in length, 7 and 8 inches in width -- and a big toe measuring 2 inches wide for the smaller creature and 3 inches for the larger. Along with footprints, he also found trampled trails in a heavily wooded area, and branches and bark broken off trees about 20 feet high.",
