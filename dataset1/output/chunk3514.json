            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness. He is paramilitary trained, and was taught tracking and distance measuring techniques. He was home on leave from Kuwait when this incident occurred. Creature was brownish and silver in color and in his estimation, 10ft tall. As mentioned in his original account, the head of the creature was just below the lowest branches on the tree. He went to the tree and jumped up and could not hit the low branches. He can jump and touch 9 ft from a standstill (training). Distance to him from tree was 200 meters in his estimation. The duration of the sighting was around 1 minute. It occurred at 4pm. He started to walk towards the creature, looked down to watch where he was going, looked up and the creature was gone. He continued on with his camping and fishing, and at 1 A.M. he heard a long howl. He is quite familiar with Sasquatch, having seen one beginning at the age of 6 at his grandparents farm in Pennsylvania. They are regular visitors to his grandparents farm to this day, and this is mentioned only to give note that he was not at all surprised to see one in Kansas, and is able to recognize this as a Sasquatch versus any other animal normally mistaken for a Sasquatch. He made note the head was unusually large, and he coincides this with an animal of great age, based on previous sightings. He has offered to take me to the exact location at any time, and it is relatively close to my home. Again, this is a highly trained soldier, credible, precise in his description of distance, objects, time, etc. He is credible from my perspective.",
