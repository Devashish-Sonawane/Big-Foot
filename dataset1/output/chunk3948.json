            "Observed": "This was years ago and probably not significant now, I am now 60, this happened when I was 12. Myself, sister and 4 other neighbor kids had to walk about 3/4 of a mile from where the school bus dropped us off to our homes, the road was gravel, very few houses and far apart. We had just got dropped off by the bus and were walking home, as I was walking I happened to catch something out of the corner of my eye and turned around to see what it was, as I turned around a creature, that I now know as bigfoot, came up the side of the ditch. It was on all fours until it topped the edge of the ditch. The ditches were very deep probably 6 to 7 feet, and wide. I think it was laying on the side of the slope until we walked past, when it jumped on the road on 2 feet, it took a couple steps across the road, jumped the ditch on the opposite side, took another step or 2, put one hand on a wooden fence leaped over it and ran probably 1000 to 1500 feet across an open field, on two legs, upright. The fence was designed to hold ponies and I can remember I had to grab the upper wooden rail, put my foot on the middle rail and swing my leg on the top rail and climb down the other side. I was 12 so I would say the fence was around 5 foot high. This thing scaled it with ease, we all had a clear view of this beast, it ran across that field faster than the ponies could run. At that time I never heard of a bigfoot. I went home, told my dad what had happened, he went down and looked for tracks, thinking bear. No tracks found as it was mostly sandy ground. I wondered all my life what I had seen. About 20 years ago I seen a TV show about bigfoot and it dawned on me that was what I had seen. My sister can also remember the incident, she was 9. I would like to say this was completely covered with hair, I did not see its face, but it was not 8 or 9 feet tall, my best guess would put it at between 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 feet tall, I can still to this day see this happening in my memories like it was yesterday, this is probably not important ,been far too many years ago, but I thought I would share this with you anyway.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Even today a look at a satellite map of this area shows connected woodlands that stretch from the sighting location northwards to Sanford Lake and the Au Sable State Forest.  Continuing northward following Wixom Lake and the multiple branches of the Titabawassee River you eventually end up in the Huron National Forest.  Imagine what it was like more than fifty years ago when Mr. W had his sighting.I was immediately drawn to this report because it involved a school-age child.  I too have had forest experiences that were a bit inexplicable at such a young age.  I had convinced myself that these were only my imagination but reports like these allow me to re-consider what might have happened all those years ago.A further reason that I wanted to know more about this report is the detail that the figure was initially moving in the manner of a quadruped. This is not as common to hear reported and could lead to a mis-identification of a known animal.I asked Mr. W some clarification questions understanding that this event happened quite a long time ago.  Here are my questions.  His answers are paraphrased.I asked Mr. W what the weather was like because that can have an important impact on our ability to see detail.\u0093\u0085the weather was clear and it was a very nice day and probably about five in the afternoon as we had just gotten off of the school bus.\"What made you think that the figure was hiding from you?\u0093...I think it was lying on the side of the ditch, which is why I didn\u0092t see it at first as I walked by.  As soon as I passed, it popped up and used its arms to leap to its feet and onto the road. I never saw its face but it appeared to be about six feet tall and covered in dark colored hair.\u0094I asked Mr. W to discuss how the figure moved.\u0093(After it popped up)...it never went back on all fours, took a couple steps across the road, and leaped a ditch, put one hand on the top of a fence post and leaped over just as a man would over a much shorter fence.  The fence was made of two wooden rails 2 X 6 with the top rail five feet tall.  It then ran about 1500 to 2000 feet and it probably lasted less than ten seconds.  This was much faster than the Shetland ponies [normally found in this enclosure] could run that distance.  I do remember it was sort of hunched over as it ran, not like a man would be...this has never left my mind.\u0094As a track and field coach I analyze runners.  This speed was astonishing.  I decided to look into the figures.  Shetland ponies can easily gallop 18 mph.  So I checked the distance that could be ran in ten seconds at this speed and came up with the following answer:  264 ft in 10 seconds.  An average human runs at about 12 mph so could cover about 176 ft in that time.  Whatever it was out there that day was fast.  Given the estimate of time and distance as well as the age of the sighting, it is safer to say that the figure appeared to move faster than a horse and that alone is quite compelling.  Your teacher was correct, you will use math in the future.Mr. W went on to describe howls that he and locals had heard in the area in the late 1960\u0092s.  \u0093I can remember hearing the howls like a woman or possibly a child screaming.\u0094  His neighbors believed his story and searched the area of their sighting, but the prints that were found had little detail due to the sandy composition of the soil.When and if I am able to speak to the sister, I will update this report. Our discussion ended, Mr. W stated the following: \u0093I will say this, Bigfoot is absolutely real, no doubt about it in my mind.\u0094",

We went running for the hills.  I carried the memory for many years and have never doubted that this was a true sighting.

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length and found her to be very credible.  She still lives in Nebraska and is a dental hygienist in another part of the state. This report was one of the most dated sightings I have ever dealt with, so it was interesting to say the least.  Although she did not know much about the subject, the Niobrara River just to the north of Valentine has had a history of sightings all along its shores.  A few more details can be added to the event.She and her friend were playing a game of hide-and-seek with several children from the neighborhood so children were all over, running about the area.  She and her friend were not actually walking down the alley, but instead were pursuing others or vice versa. The two ran into the alley from a yard and were immediately confronted with an animal walking on two legs heading towards them, about fifteen feet away.  The animal then let out a very loud scream and did not slow down its pace or change direction.  The girls then screamed and ran back around the corner and out of the alley, in the same direction at which they entered.  They ran home and did not see or hear it again.  They were not pursued.  The animal was described as much taller than a person, covered in dark hair and very visible eyes.  It had no neck and did not pump its arms while it was walking towards them.   When I asked the witness about specific details of the animal, the most striking feature she could recall was the mouth.  It was very wide and gaping while it screamed at them.  It had very large, box-shaped teeth.  She described the scream as that of an animal in pain. The other girl she was playing with was of the same age and was visiting the town with her parents.When she told her friends at school about the incident the next day, a teacher who lives in the neighborhood told her that she had also heard the scream the previous night.To people who don\u0092t live in the Midwest, it might be difficult to understand something like this happening in a town.  The town of Valentine sits by itself in the middle of the Sandhills and has been a cattle town since it was founded.  It is very isolated and has a major river running through it, just north of town.",
