            "Follow-Up Report": "12/07/09: Interviewed the witness.  The following is the result of the interview. The day before the opening of deer season, the witness and his friend went to the area to check it out and set up the tree stands.  They noticed a heavy musty smell, much like that of a mink.  The smell was not offensive.The next day, the witness was in his stand by 5:15 a.m.  It was still very dark and rainy.  The musty smell was still present and he thought this somewhat  peculiar.  After about 20 minutes he heard an odd whistle.  This came from his left approx. 75 yards away.  This was followed by a series of whooping sounds coming from the opposite direction.  He then heard logs or large branches breaking and snapping.  From past experience in the  forestry industry, he knew from the sounds of the branches being snapped were rather large, perhaps three to five inches in diameter.  This incident, starting with the whistle lasted five minutes or a little more.  The witness was very shaken by the incident, but did not leave and continued hunting.  Later in the day the witness did shoot a deer.  As he was gutting it, he had the uneasy feeling of being watched.  When he met with his friend later in the day, his friend asked if he had heard anything unusual.  The friend had heard the whooping and said something was walking around his tree stand, but couldn\u0092t see a thing because at the time it was still very dark. Since the incident, the witness has found recordings on the BFRO website of the whistle and whoops he heard.  The records are excerpts from the Sierra Sounds:Whistle: http://www.bigfootsounds.com/excerpt3.mp3Whoops: http://www.bfro.net/avevid/sierrasounds/Whoop.mp3",

            "Observed": "Several friends and I were riding our mtbs on the swamp route. There was about a 3-5 minute gap between each of us.  As i ascended the trail I heard a large animal moving in the forest about 20 yards off the trail. I couldn't see it but could clearly hear it in the underbrush.  As i proceeded up the trail one of my friends was in the trail looking at something.  A set of very large footprints were in the trail.  This was about 200 yards up from were i heard the noises.  The track came from off the trail onto it and proceeded down the trail about 30-50.  The subject walked a few steps the stopped and stood still moved a few more feet stopped as if listening.  It proceedded down the trail a few more yards before heading into a small meadow.  This meadow is very near the place i head the noises in the bush.  The foot prints were in very deep silty powder and were very well detailed.  I could see the lines in the sole of the foot the toes were very splayed and there was little to no arch.  total lenght of the prints was about 14-15\" as I could fit my whole foot shoe and all in the print.  The track was liad down on top of the tracks of my friends who were about 5 min. ahead of us.  A couple of bear hunters came upon us and we asked them what they thought, and they had never seen such a track. After loosing the track off of the road we proceeded with our ride.  About one half mile up the road the track apeared again fromm off the road moving across the road going downhill toward the previous site of prints.  The bear hunters also found the new tracks and tired to follow it but the brush was too thick.",
