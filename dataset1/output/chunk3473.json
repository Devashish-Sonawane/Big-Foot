I still vividly remember the encounter and how terrified my friend and I were afterwards.  It\u0092s amazing how time slows during intense moments, every detail is burned to memory, but in actuality only several seconds passed.  To be honest, I don\u0092t know exactly what I saw that summer evening long ago.  As a child growing up, we were taught in school the legends surrounding the Jersey Devil and weird happenings in the Pine Barrens.  Hopefully this story won\u0092t be viewed as lore that the region is famous for.  The only thing I can say for sure is, it really did happen and I will do my best to portray the event as I remember it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on the evening of January 18th 2009. The following details can be added.The witness did not know what he had seen back in 1989. Bigfoot did not cross his mind because he always thought this species was only found in parts of the west coast. This changed when he read some of the other reports for the same general area on the BFRO web site.The creature was built like a tall runner, lean, muscular, very fast and agile as it crossed the one lane road in two strides. The witness compared the movement of the creature to that of a deer. The arms were long, the fingers reached below the knee. The hair appeared to have a mangy look.The witness did not get a good look at the face but was able to tell it was flat and did not have a snout like a bear or dog.This was the only encounter the witness ever had.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Editor Comment (Matt Moneymaker):  I re-categorized this one to Class B.  It was a very brief observation in the dark, and witness is not sure what he saw.  Though it was most likely a bigfoot, which do exist in rural parts of New Jersey, the type of observation should be considered Class B.",
