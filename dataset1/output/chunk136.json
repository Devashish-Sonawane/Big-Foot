It was a small town radio interview with a mother and daughter that were coon hunting at night in an area that I know well and they had a class A encounter. I told my son about it and he took a walk in the area a couple of days later. He called me and told me that he came across a structure that must have been built by boy scouts or something. I went in to check it a couple of days later and took some very good photos of it and some of the surrounding area. I returned to the area again today 08/13/2015 to check the structure and took more photos which I can send.",
