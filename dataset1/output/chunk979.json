Its legs were long and not bowed like an ape. His arms were a little longer than a humans would be but not ape like. He turned and walked away. His stride was just like a human would walk. It did not seam to be scared of me at all. I could tell it was intelligent by the way it looked at me. It knew i was not going to harm it.",

            "Observed": "This incident occurred in Texas about one year ago.  I know Texans are known for telling tall tales but so help me this is true. While driving down a country road about three miles southeast of Bryson, Texas around 10AM on a bright clear day I noticed what I first thought was large person crossing the road in front of me. I was driving around 30mph. It was about 50 yards in front of my truck. I came to a stop where I thought it had crossed. It crossed from south to north. North was to the left of my truck. I looked to see if I could recognize the person who crossed the road. I grew up in that area and know most of the people who live there. Standing about 50 ft. from my truck was some sort of creature. It was standing and facing me. The creature was about seven to eight feet tall. It had redish brown hair all over its body. You could also see its skin because the hair was thin. Its skin was very pinkish like it was sun burnt. Its hands and feet looked human like but they were very large. Its nose was wide but flat. Its lips were very thin. We looked at each other for a good five min. I had a gun in my truck but never thought of shooting this thing because it looked so human but also ape like. It finally turned and walked into the woods. I sat in my truck shocked at what I had seen. After a little while I got out to see if I could see any foot prints. I did not find any. The ground was too hard to leave any. This creature had to weigh at least 400 lbs. I have never said anything to anyone about this creature before. I didnt want people to think I am crazy but I know what I saw. It was not any animal I have seen in a zoo or anywhere else. We do not have bears in this part of Texas or no apes that I know of.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I drove through the area of the sighting.  In examining the surrounding environment, I noted that the area is indeed remote, rugged, hilly, and forested with an abundant water supply.  The area is part of the Cross Timbers area northwest of Ft. Worth.  The Brazos River and Possum Kingdom Lake are both not far away.Not long after my visit to the area, I was able to speak to the witness.  The witness stated that he has a hunting lease south of Bryson.  On this particular day, he was driving down a dirt road several miles from his lease, \"scoping for game,\" at approximately 1000 hours.  Up ahead, he noticed what he thought to be a \"person in the middle of the road about 50 yards away.\"  The witness thought that the \"person looked kind of strange, like maybe he had a coat on.\"  The witness thought something was odd about this person and that \"it didn't look just right.\"  The \"person\" crossed the road and the witness stopped his vehicle at the point of the crossing.  He looked to his left and saw that the \"person\" was actually some sort of unfamiliar, strangely \"human-like, but ape-like\" animal, now standing approximately 50 feet away just on the other side of a fence that ran parallel to the road.  The animal was facing the witness and peering at him in a most inquisitive fashion.  The witness asked himself at that moment, \"What am I seeing?\"  The animal appeared to turn its head slowly from side to side, looking peripherally at the witness, \"like he was near-sighted.\"  Then the animal cocked its head back and peered down its nose at the witness.  The witness thought that the creature was \"trying to focus or figure out what I was, sitting in my truck.\"  The witness stated, \"I could tell it was intelligent by the way it looked at me.\"  The creature seemed totally unafraid of the witness and seemed more curious than anything.  The witness had a 30-30 Winchester, lever-action rifle with him, but never felt a need to even grab the weapon.  The creature did not seem to threaten the witness at all, nor did it seem to feel threatened.    After what seemed like five minutes passed, the creature turned and \"walked nonchalantly\" off into the wooded area behind.  The witness watched it walk in a manner not unlike a human another 40 to 50 yards until it was no longer visible.  The creature never once turned and looked back. The witness described the animal as looking \"like an orangutan, but more human - with reddish-brown hair and around seven feet tall.\"  Its \"legs were just like a human being and were long and not bowed like an ape.\"  Regarding the face, the animal had a \"flat, wide nose, thin lips and a flat face.\"  The witness could see no ears, but noted that the head and shoulders seemed to be covered in long hair, perhaps six or seven inches in length.  The neck was not discernable and the head seemed to sit directly on the shoulders.  The head did not seem to have a conical shape, and appeared to be somewhat rounded, but the witness said he could not be sure because of the abundance of hair on the head.  On the chest and abdominal area,  the hair was shorter and thin enough to see skin, which was \"pinkish\" in color.  Also, the witness indicated that the animal had \"wide shoulders, strong arms and narrow legs.\"  The animal's arms were noted to be \"a little longer than a human's arms would be but not ape-like.\"  Even though no genitalia were visible, the creature appeared to be male, with no visible, protruding breasts.  The witness did not note any odors or sounds.In summation, I found the witness to be very sincere.  He said he has never told anyone of his experience for fear of ridicule.  He also told me that he is a \"66 year old man, pretty solid and willing to swear on the Holy Bible\" about his encounter.  For those skeptics who will find his testimony incredible, the witness remarked, \"They're there - rest assured.  I saw him real good. And it was a bigfoot.\"  ",
