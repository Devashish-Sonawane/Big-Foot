We parked are truck up on top of a ridge and hiked down a draw that leads into a canyon. I started down to a sidehill above the draw while my dad and brother headed down the draw. After being seperate from each other for about 15 minutes I was up above the draw a ways, and I was standing there looking around the hillsides when I heard a kind of moaning howling sound which to me at that time sounded like a man yelling \"help\"very slowly and weakly like they were hurt. So I started to head back down into the draw to make sure it wasnt someone needing help. About 30 seconds went by and I heard it again so I stopped to listen I heard it a little louder this time since I was farther down the draw.",

He also mentioned that a year or 2 before this incident, that he and a friend had been about 6-8 miles from this incident and they had seen more of the same tracks, and had followed them for over a 100ft, and stopped following when they entered a heavy brushy draw, which is a small natural depression that water drains into or a shallow gully.",
