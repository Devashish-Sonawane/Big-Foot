            "Observed": "I was sitting on the front porch of the house into which my family had just moved.  The porch faced the state highway which was about 100 metes to the east.  The dirt road from the highway to the house was lined to the south with trees.  The house into which we had just moved seemed quite old.  However, between our house and the highway there was a ranch style brick house toward the north of the dirt road.  50 meters to the south of our house stood a barn with a hog pen in front.  The house had a full, flat porch facing the east with four pillars, three steps to the ground and no rail.  My 6 year old sister was closest to the barn.  My 4 year old brother was sitting on the steps.  I was standing next to the steps toward the north.  I heard my sister scream and start crying.  I looked to the barn as a large creature stood there.  It stood a foot taller than the opening of the barn door.  It turned toward the east, its' right, and taking long strides steped easily over the hog pen fence.  When it got to the corner of the barn it looked south then turned to walk west.  Mom came out of the house and told us to stay out of the barn.  Later that day I was over by the barn and saw the large foot prints repleat with toe marks.  Over the remaining time we lived in that house, through the next spring, we heard loud noises at times coming from the metal grain silos to the west of the barn.  Though, we never saw the creature again.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. He is a retired career military man (former 82nd Airborne). He said the property had been abandoned for some time before they moved in. The sighting lasted approximately one to two minutes and was from a distance of about seventy five yards. The creature was massively built and over seven feet tall. Its arms seemed to hang almost to knee length. When he first saw the creature it was somewhat stooped as it had just exited the barn. When it walked away it did so in a human manner but with a forward leaning, \u0093like someone who had lower back problems\u0094. This should not be misinterpreted as the creature being crippled as the witness also described its walking motion as \u0093fluid\u0094.  The creature was hair covered. The hair was dark, almost black, but with a somewhat greenish tint. In a later Email the witness expounded on this coloring. \"A friend of mine uses that Grecian Formula stuff on his hair.  His hair color isn't exactly black but has a greenish color to it.  His hair is the same color as the fellow we saw coming out of the barn.\"  The face was oval in shape, flat and somewhat dark \"like a well tanned man\". It was lighter in color than the fur. The face \u0093didn\u0092t have a lot of fur on it, it was mostly skin. I could tell the face had a lot of wrinkles\u0094. The head \u0093seemed kind of small for his size\u0094. The tracks found later \u0093long and broad with five toes\u0094. The barn had a hayloft and \u0093it looked like someone could have been sleeping in it\u0094.  As the year went into winter \u0093you could hear banging sounds and sometimes howls- not like a dog or coyote, but more high pitched and piercing\u0094 . The witness\u0092s mother also saw the creature, but she refused to talk about it.  The witness\u0092s mother and sister are still disturbed by talking about the sighting and did not wish to be interviewed.",
