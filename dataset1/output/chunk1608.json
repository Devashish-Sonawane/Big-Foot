            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness over the phone.  This witness lives about half the time in Alaska, where he works repairing fishing boats.  During his off-season, he spends time hiking in Washington State.  The high Cascade mountain lakes, and this spot in particular are favorite locations.  In Alaska, he camps often, and is very familiar with bears.  He felt that this creature was no bear.  The witness prefers to keep the exact location confidential, although he is willing to take a couple of investigators up there to see and evaluate the area first hand.  He said that the climb and hike are difficult and not for people who are out of shape.  Because of my past search and rescue experience, I have flown search patterns over this particular location and know it quite well.  It is indeed remote and hard to reach.  Particularly interesting points are that there was a signature box at the top of one of the cliffs where the witness went exploring on the second day.  This box was severely damaged, as if something had tried to break into it.  Also, the vegetation around the area was torn up.  It is possible that a bear could have made this damage.  Then, he observed a fir tree that was broken off about 9 feet above the ground, and he could see no natural cause for the breakage.  During his hike up, He noticed a black, shiny spot on top of the ridge, which he thought was some kind of animal.  He tried to make a lot of noise to see if he could make it move, but it remained motionless.  He felt it was watching him.  Later, while descending back down to the lake, the black, shiny thing was still there.  If this was a bear, it is not characteristic bear behavior.  Deer and elk are a different color.  The only remaining possibility is a sasquatch, if it was an animal.  Later, after making dinner, he heard the very loud whooping sound that he describes as a long, sustained \u0093C\u0094 note.  Due to the volume, and the manner of the sound, he knew it was no animal that he was familiar with.  It was too early for elk to be bugling.  Later that night, he heard a \u0093crack\u0094 that was as loud as a gunshot, but sounded like wood on wood.  Then from an estimated 100 yards away, he heard another \u0093crack\u0094 that he described as rock on rock.  This so frightened the witness that he spent the rest of the night awake in his sleeping bag with his back up against a rock.  I believe that based on the description and volume of the vocalizations, which are not like any of the wild game animals in the area, and the wood and rock knocking, that it is very likely that this witness had an encounter with a sasquatch.  This behavior is consistent with other reports as well as my own personal experiences and those reported by other investigators.",

            "Observed": "It was early april here in southern michigan, I was sitting watching tv around 2:30 AM and was preparing to go to bed when I felt like I was being watched. I live in a rented 12x70 2 bedroom trailer.   I was sitting at my pc looking across the room at the tv, when I felt odd and noticed in my peripheral vision that I couldn't see my neihgbor's outside light. That is when I turned to look straight out the window, the window was about 4 feet from me, and I found myself staring straight into the big , yellowed, bloodshot eyes of a sasquatch.  It looked like it was hairy all over -  I saw a hint of reddish, light brown colored hair on the forearm and shoulder.  The lighting on it was poor and I couldn't make out any facial features besides the eyes and it was staring right back at me. I have been living in this trailer for 6 months over winter months with no signs of anything strange going on around here. Well I jumped from my chair and threw off the blanket I had on my legs and stared right at it for a second and then realised my front door wasn't completely shut and locked.  I hurriedly reached for the handle to shut it and lock it and when the door handle met my hand, I tried to push it closed but it wouldn't move.  It was actually pushing the door open on me! After trying to move it, it wouldn't budge, so I gave in and sprinted to the back of my trailer and shut the bathroom door behind me and listened. I didn't hear anything actually enter the house, and after a few minutes of quiet, I exited the bathroom and entered my bedroom and got my gun and woke my wife. We both walked quietly back into the living room and the door was opened half-way, but there was no sign of it. I called a friend on the phone to come over to use his truck lights and my flashlights to search around but there was no more signs of it that night. The next morning I looked for tracks but there were none.  I did however find something like hairy, muddy fingerprints on the window pane.  I snapped a couple shots of it, and I stood where it was and determined the height to be around 8-81/2 feet tall. Since that night, both my wife and I have heard loud, mournful vocalizations in the middle of the night.  We have both gone out to investigate when we hear them and we hear loud, very large sounding \"things\" moving through the brush and weeds, shaking weeds, and we have smelled an awful, dead-skunk like smell on a couple of occassions in the early mornings. My friend and I have sat in a vehicle for a few hours in the early night, 11 PM-2 AM, and have heard brush and movement thru weeds attracting dogs close by to bark, and have had rocks or sticks thrown at the vehicle we are in. Also we were using a million candle spot that night we had stones thrown, and my friend swears he saw something \"manlike\" walking across our field of vision but we didn't get cameras or spot on it fast enough.That night I mention, which was 7-12-2006, was a full moon night so we had good night vision for a ways. My friend has also had large footprints in his driveway and has a local friend of his son has seen a pair of eyes, really high up and not very far away in the weeds while he and my friend's son and another boy were out jumping on a trampoline in the early evening one night 2 yrs ago and now he won't go out at night, and he is 16yrs old. My neighbors have been calling the police a couple of times a year, always in spring or summer, about \"someone\" or \"something\" walking and sneaking around their yard at night. This has been happening for about 8 yrs total now.  This property was all wood and scrub, and thick brush till around 8 yrs ago when the landowner cleared it up. The landlord's nephew said he saw a \"man\" walking through the yard around 11:30 AM 4 weeks ago and he thought it might have been me, but it wasn't.  We went to the area he saw it in during daylight and I was much shorter then what he saw. The landlord's wife was walking around a trailer in the middle of the property during the afternoon and felt like she was being watched and then she heard something very large run away through the brush just around the corner of a trailer where she was walking. This property is about 20 acres; he cleared about 10 of it and has 3 rental trailers on it.  I occupy one at the south end of the property, and he lives in one at the north end of the property.  The one in the middle is vacant, plus a couple of tool, supply  trailers(12x70 each) which he keeps shut and locked but the doors keep coming open and  there is some damage that we can't explain that looks like some of the siding was pried up or something tried to rip a piece off.  Also there are deep scratches around this piece of siding. The landlord and I have heard something tossing around some wood studs he has stacked up in the middle of his property and also we have heard what sounded like a long pipe thrown into weeds banging on a piece of wood.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I was able to visit with the witness and his family, and explore the area over two days.  The area has a rich wildlife environment - plenty of forest cover, creeks, berries, and orchards.  There were also signs of deer in the area.  The main encounter occurred in April, 2006, when he seen a creature staring at him through one of his windows.  He noticed that he couldn't see his neighbors light shining through the window, and noticed something blocking it out.  At first he wasn't sure what he was seeing, but after staring at it for a number of seconds, he realized it was something that was looking back at him.  At this point, he tried to push his door shut, which was open to let in a breeze.  Something was holding it against his push, and he wasn't able to budge it, so he ran and woke his wife up and grabbed a firearm.  He didn't hear anything after the incident, and nothing entered his house.I inspected the window that the creature was looking through and was able to estimate that it stood about 8' tall.  The witness states that the creature's shoulders sloped into it's head, almost as if it didn't have a neck, and the head was pointed at the top.  The shoulders were extremely wide.  The eyes were very dark, and yellowed and bloodshot around the edges.  There was also a scar above the right eye that stood out.  Many other incidents have occurred  - rocks and sticks being thrown at cars and humans, howls,  occasional footprints seen, tall creatures seen at night, and property and items in the area being manipulated and 'hit'.  Sometimes around 4:30-5:00 AM something big bangs the side of the witness' residence, and startles everybody awake.  Upon rushing outside during some of these occurrences, nothing is seen.  The creature watching him in the window still scares the witness to this day.  For a few months he was reluctant to be outside alone late at night.  This is one of the few things he's ever been scared of  in his life, and he says he'll never forget it. The witness supplied this drawing:",
