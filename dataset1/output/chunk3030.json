They were likely alone.The witness sent me the link for the cabin he rented to verify the location.The whoops and knocks occurred about 3am while he was awake and restless in his cot.  They were heard clearly.We both agreed the quiet condition of the forest was not that unusual and the tap on the window may very well have been a bug.The interesting part of the report is the witness hearing two whoops and two knocks from inside the cabin suggesting a rather close proximity.  The sounds were loud enough not to be mistaken.The location is in an area with other reports of activity.",
