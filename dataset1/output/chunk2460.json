            "Follow-Up Report": "As an investigator I have been fortunate enough to hear many possible vocalizations in the field.  I think back to the amount of time I spent hunting and camping and wonder what I missed before, simply because I did not know what I was listening to.  That is why I am particularly interested in cases where multiple witnesses have frequent experiences hearing vocals over a long period of time.  This report from Ogemaw County is about ten miles south of the Rifle River Recreation Area and about twenty miles south of the Huron National Forest. I have camped and canoed the area as well spending a great deal of time night hiking through the woods of Huron with a red light and recorder on.When I contacted the first witness Mr. K, he was reluctant to say that what he heard was anything other than something normal from the woods.  He stated that they may have been \"...a pack of coyotes attacking an animal.\" As kids they called the vocals \"the Banshee Cries.\" What eventually changed the discussion away from more mundane causes for the vocals occurred when I shared clips of audio I had collected from central Michigan that seemed to be similar to his descriptions.  I forwarded them and received an immediate response.  A few of the vocals were similar \"but not quite exact.\"  However, this changed our discussion.  We now had a reference, albeit a possible one, to work with and compare.  He could remember that the vocals sounded similar to coyotes but there was something different about them.  \"They turned into very high-pitched screams.\"  These vocals are as yet unpublished but will be made available after the Michigan Episode of Animal Planet's Finding Bigfoot airs.While I was in the process of talking with Mr. C his cousin emailed me with his version of the story.  Mr. H's family owns the cabin where the 1998 screams were heard and stated that he too, heard them frequently and it was always late at night.  He stated that the first time he heard them was Memorial Day weekend around 1 am.  The following is the rest of the story in his words:\"When we first heard it, it seemed to be quite far away. About a half hour later we heard it again and it was close. I have hunted since I have been of legal age and I never heard anything like this. It sounded like a rabbit in distress, deep growling, loud cheering that was drowned out just enough you could not tell what it was, mixed in with the sound of animals The first night I tried to play it off as coyotes, but my hair was standing on end. The second night, we were sleeping in a tent outside the cabin,  we went to bed a little later, and after everything had settled down, maybe 20 minutes or so, we heard it again, this time really close. My adrenaline went to overdrive immediately. Maybe 10 minutes later, we heard it again, and I got out of bed, and ran in the house. We have heard it off and on maybe every other year. All the dogs within ear shot go crazy whenever we hear it. I have listened to some of the audio on the BFRO web site and some are close but nothing dead on. Talking to the locals up there, they say they have heard odd noises that they can't explain. They also told me the dogs will not go into the woods at night.\"Both witnesses have offered to help if they hear any more interesting nighttime vocals.  They were straight-forward in their answers and critical in their discussion regarding the comparison vocals I shared.  I found their story compelling.",
