            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness's son (report submitted by the son) at length by phone on October 31, 2006. The son related the encounter that happened to his father as submitted. As he shined the light, the animal howled and scared his father. His father related that whatever it was ran in an odd manner, perhaps like someone running on their heels.The animal howled four more times as it moved away. As the animal moved away, the father relayed that he heard a gun shot and dogs barking in the direction that the animal had moved. The police were called but they went in the wrong direction and never found anything. Both the father and the son went to the area by the pond and found the grass depressed but no tracks. This area is very undeveloped from the sighting to almost 20 miles North until you get to Willacoochie, GA.The son related that his father had grown up in the Pacific Northwest, had hunted all his life and had never believed in Bigfoot until now. The son found the BFRO website and had his father listen to the recorded vocalizations. His father identified the Ohio howl as very, very similiar to what he heard and is adament it was not a bear.I asked for permission to come down and scout the area but he said his father just wanted to forget the whole thing. He said this really scared his father and he still does not want to really talk about it. Should he change his mind, he will contact me and I will make a trip to south Georgia.",

We heard high-pitched sounds, almost like an ape, so I started to mimic the sounds. Just then, my co-worker asked me what kind of sound that was that I was making. Then, as he was up in the bucket, he said a man crossed the road. I thought he was just fooling around. As we hung more interduct, I noticed a large hairy animal which crossed the road. At first, I did not think anything of it, but this thing kept walking back and forth out to the middle of the road looking at me. I had my hand over my eyebrows trying to get a better look and to cut the glare off from the sun. This animal was not walking with a limp or bent over. To me, it walked straight up and down like a man. It was looking at me as if I had puzzled it with my impersonation. I would say it was a good 70 yards away. I tried to reason it to be a man, but all the men working in the area had hard hats on with reflective vests-us also.This thing was walking back and forth like you see a wild animal in the zoo. It did pause several times in the middle of the road to look at me, as if it had some kind of intelligence. For some reason I felt it was female. The arms were long and hung at the animal's side. The hips were wider than the shoulders",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Mr. Ford was part of a crew working on telecommunication cable when the sighting occurred. He is quite certain he did not see a bear and that the animal was not a man. He further described the animal as having an all over dark brown/black color. The arms hung long at its sides, they did not move noticeably when the animal walked.  As noted in the report, the hips were wider than the shoulders. The animal's head was not large, but did come to a bit of a point. Due to the glare from the sun, Mr. Ford was unable to make out the face very well. Mr. Ford estimated the animal was about 60 yards away from him. He watched it walk back and forth between the bushes and the road at least 3-4 times. Each time it walked into the road, it would stop and look directly at the Mr. Ford, even cocking its head to the right as if trying to figure out what Mr. Ford was. The last time it entered the bushes, Mr. Ford saw the animal's foot as it was walking and noted the foot was extremely large. Mr. Ford estimates the height of the animal to be over 8 feet tall.The bushes near the road were not as tall as the animal, but were thick and led into heavy areas of Fir. The other members of the crew were working while Mr. Ford was viewing what he describes as this animal's \"display\". Mr. Ford stated that the pacing behavior reminded him greatly of an animal pacing in a zoo. Mr. Ford stated that he knew afterwards he had seen something extraordinary and now firmly believes in the existence of sasquatch.",
