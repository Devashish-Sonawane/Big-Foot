We were in a heavily wooded area with thick underbrush in a valley behind our tobacco barn playing in the stream that ran along one side of the barn.  We were collecting rocks and making a dam for a swimming hole for the next summer's use.  It was late in the afternoon- almost dusk.  I kept having one of those \"gut feelings\" that something wasn't \"right\" but I couldn't put my finger on it, so we kept working. I had mentioned my feeling to my brother.  I crossed the stream with a jump holding a large field rock and heard a stick break loudly.  I looked under my feet and there was nothing but leaves and mud, I looked back across the stream at my brother who wasn't near any dead fall.  I also had a severe wake up call in my gut to get out of there.  I placed my rock and told my brother we had to get out of there immediately, something wasn't right.  He didn't protest as his hackles were also raised by that time.",
