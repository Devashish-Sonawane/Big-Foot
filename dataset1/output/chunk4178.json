            "Observed.1  ": "But lately, Ottosen has been no peaceful isolated respite. It has been more like Times square. Trucks, cars and motorcycles have roared into town, some of the occupants brandishing flashlights - and a few guns. The visitors have trampled through vacant houses and weedy lots, probing the shadows and knocking on doors and asking for directions. One resident, appalled by the intrusion, called the Humboldt County Sheriff Marvin Anderson to complain that she couldn't safely cross the street in front of her home. Foul-Smelling  The source of the commotion is stories of a creature lurking in Ottosen, a hairy, foul-smelling, 5-foot-high ape-like monster that growls and grunts and lives in the shadows.  On at least three separate occasions in the past 1-1/2 weeks, the creature reportedly has been seen. The witnesses include two women and six children. Mrs. Jan Henkins, who said she briefly saw the creature twice, said, \"It isn't anything like I've seen before.\" \"People think I'm just crazy,\" she said. \"But I know what I saw.\" Mrs. Hawkins said she believes two of her daughters saw the 'monster'. She described the girls as \"white with fright.\" Adding to the drama are assorted stories of dogs and rabbits being mutilated, of cats disappearing, of May Helleseth's grapevines being mysteriously stripped of their fruit and leaves. One resident said, \"Every dog in town was barking on the nights when the creature was seen.\" Trampled Grass The visitor to Ottosen is shown paths of trampled tall grass where he is told \"the monster ran\". In and near cornfields where the animal allegedly vanished, there are impressions in the mud. But they are old impressions and undefined. There is now the claim of a Des Moines man that the so-called Ottosen creature may, in fact, be Bigfoot, the elusive, legendary primate of the Northwest. Kevin Cook, who said he has stalked Bigfoot for 10 years, said there are a small group of Bigfoots (or Bigfeet?) traveling by night through the Midlands, generally following the Missouri and Mississippi river basins. Ottosen is about three miles east of the west fork of the Des Moines River. Cook, who pursues Bigfoot as a hobby and works as a customer service officer for United Airlines at the Des Moines airport, said the Ottosen sightings are among many in South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota. He said there are more than one species of the creature, some as small as 5 to 6 feet and similar to the creature believed to have been seen at Ottosen. There are, however, skeptics about the Ottosen claims and the talk of hairy creatures roaming the Iowa countryside. The cautious include Sheriff Anderson, who said he would like to have \"something solid to go on.\" \"I believe these people saw something, but I don't know what.\" In his office at the Humboldt County Courthouse in Dakota City, Anderson said: \"I wouldn't rule out the possibility of someone wearing a costume. I would think he'd get by with it at night. But what has me puzzled is that one of the sightings was during the day. And anybody wearing a costume would be taking an awful chance. They could get shot.\" Large Animal? Anderson took samples of what were believed to be footprints where the alleged creature fled into a cornfield, but the impressions were inconclusive. Mrs. Richard Kinseth, wife of Ottosen's mayor said, \"Possibly there is some large animal. It could be a bear, a large bird or some creature.\" \"I don't think you can dismiss what people said they saw, but we don't have to go wild about it.\" John Wolfe, 11, was walking about 12:30 p.m., Monday with Greg Masters, 10 and Steve Bennet, 12, near the sale barns at the edge of town. \"We were sort of goofing around and chased a cat up a tree. It was scared and it was bleeding,\" he said. \"We heard this scratching noise come from in one of the small buildings like something rubbing up against something. We tossed a rock into the building.\" Suddenly, in a window, a face appeared and then as quickly disappeared, he said. \"It was a big head, square-like,\" the youngster said. \"he had big eyes and a flat nose and broad shoulders. He was covered by black or dark brown hair.\" Big Leaps Frightened, the youngsters ran. John said he looked over his shoulder and saw the creature, his broad legs moving in big leaps, his body hunched over, vanish into the cornfield. He said the animal had left behind a pungent odor \"like stinkweeds.\" The sighting was the third in about a week. Earlier, 9-year-old Donette Henkins, daughter of Jan Henkins, was walking out of her grandmother's home at night, when she came face to face with a hairy figure. \"It had deep-set eyes and fangs,\" she said. \"It kind of growled and grunted.\" The girl screamed and fled. A few days later, her 12-year-old sister Dawn was riding her bicycle on Main Street at night when she said she saw a 5-foot-high figure in the light of a street light standing near a garage less than a half a block away. Stood There \"He just stood there. I couldn't see his face because it was in the shadow. But I could see he was broad and was covered with hair.\" The girl's scream brought her mother and Gina Dahl, 12, and Pat Young, 24. Riding bikes to where Dawn had been, the trio stopped when they heard a man's voice. \"Somebody asked, 'Does anybody know what time it is?'\" Mrs. Henkins said. \"I don't know where the voice came from, but we looked down toward the garage and saw this head looking at us around the corner. It had dazzling eyes, in the dark. They were as big as golf balls. It had a big head covered with hair.\" The women bolted. Mrs. Henkins said the source of the man's voice remains a mystery to her. Deputies Patrol Sheriff Anderson said he isn't sure what will happen next. He said he has sent a team of deputies to patrol the village at night \"to look around\" and to handle the nocturnal traffic of sightseers. \"There really isn't much we can do,\" he said. \"If there is an Ottosen creature, it has likely by now taken off for parts unknown,\" Cook said. \"Townsfolk and curiosity seekers have long scared it off,\" he said. But he remains firm in his belief about Bigfoot in the Midlands. \"He is intelligent in the sense he knows how to survive. He is very shy toward people. People have seen him but they either don't believe what they see or they're afraid to speak out because people think they're crazy.\" \"But its only a matter of time before he's caught. It may be a hunter or somebody who is out looking for him.\" Mrs. Henkins said she hopes that day isn't too far away. One late evening, when the sightseers are gone and the wind whips through the trees, Mrs. Henkins wonders if something is roaming outside in the shadows. \"There are nights I just can't sleep,\" she said.",

            "Observed.1  ": "Roger Thacker, Trek director said there is no evidence that a Bigfoot has tried to enter the compound, protected by a 10-foot fence. But Thacker does not discount the recent sighting reports. \"If I could get him in here, though, I'd give him free room and board,\" Thacker said. The most recent sighting reportedly occurred last week when a Ft. Lewis enlisted man was hiking in woods near Trek the wildlife park and came encountered \"a big hairy thing.\" The other sighting was reported last September by a Puyallup man who insisted a Bigfoot creature had stared at him for five minutes as he was parked in his truck on a logging road east of Trek. A MADIGAN ARMY Medical Center doctor who treated the soldier for shock said the man was still \"too unstable\" to discuss the incident. The doctor, who requested that his name be withheld, said he could not divulge the soldier's name because of the doctor-patient relationship. However, the doctor did say the soldier came to him \"extremely upset\" and would not discuss the reported sighting of Bigfoot for quite some time. \"He is quite sure he saw Bigfoot,\" the doctor said. A Madigan ambulance driver who heard of the soldier's Bigfoot encounter said he has seen \"fresh foot-prints\" within a mile of Trek and talked to the Puyallup man a short time after the September incident. Don Durden, a burly former policeman and civilian paramedic, said he was hiking near Trek and came across the footprints which measured about 16 inches long and eight inches wide. \"I'M 6 FOOT 4 and 285 pounds, and my footprint was dwarfed in comparison with his one,\" Durden said. While following the footprints, he said, he met the Puyallup man, who said he had seen a Bigfoot minutes before. \"He said the animal was between 8 and 9 feet tall with black fur covering most of the body,\" Durden said. \"The face was definitely not that of a gorilla, but closer to that of a human.\" \"He said it stared at him for five minutes and even leaned a hand on the truck, but never mad a move toward him,\" Durden said. He added that the man detected a foul smell from the animal. TREK'S DIRECTOR said, \"it is possible\" that there could be a Bigfoot in the area. He said there have been several entirely new animals discovered by scientists over the years that were thought to be \"lost.\" \"I joke about these sightings,\" Thacker said, \"but anything is possible.\"",
