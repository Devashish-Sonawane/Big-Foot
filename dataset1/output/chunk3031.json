            "Observed": "I was traveling back to Southern Oregon, from Portland, Oregon in the fall of 1991.  It was approximately 2:30 am, on a Saturday morning.  I was driving south on Interstate-5 and it was raining lightly.  The area is known as Rice Hill, about a half hour north of Roseburg, Oregon.  Heading south, the highway runs up rice Hill, sweeps to the west across the top, and then turns back to the south as it drops off.  As I crested the hill, and was exiting the the turn to the west, my headlights came level with the road and the guard rail, along the turn to the south.  Right at the point of curve, of the turn to the south, right next to the guard rail, was a bigfoot.  It was crouched down, kind of squatting, like a baseball catcher, untill my headlights were right on it, and then it stood up, quickly, took a step or two and jumped the guard rail, and went down the enbankment.  At 65 mph, I didn't see it for long, especially at night; however, there is no doubt that it was the stereotypical bigfoot.  Needless to say, I was quite surprised, and I pulled over.  My stopping distance, at that speed, put me downhill from the spot quite a way.  I was carrying a .44 magnum pistol with me, and thought about going back up on foot to look for sign, but I was a little rattled at the time, and opted not to.  I sat there for probably 5 minutes, and then continued home.  I told friends and family, but have never contacted any organization about the incident.  The only issue I have with this sighting is that is was within 4 days of Halloween (before or after, I don't remember).  That being said, I still don't quite know what to think about it.",

I stopped & turned around so I could shine the lights from the bronco on whatever it was. when we got turned around the lights from the vehicle couldn't hit it so I decided to step out with a flashlight when I shined the light on it,it stood up on it's hind legs about 30feet from me.It was standing in a borrow pit and it was at least a foot taller then me,Iam 6 foot tall.When I seen it I started yelling at it & it ducked down every time I would stop making noise it would start to raise its head again.When I backed up & got into the bronco it jumped up & ran after us,& chased us quite aways. We all seen it but we could not make out any facial features.I have heard stories in the past from friends & family of sightings in the same area but never payed much attention.Iam an avid hunter & fisherman. I spend alot of time in the outdoors I have hunted & fished in this area all my life.I have seen elk,deer,antelope,badger,& bear. just about everything that has walked crawled or swimmed. And I have never seen anything like what I seen that night. It was bigger then any bear i have ever seen & I hunt the selway were there is a large population of bear& what we seen that night was not a bear.",
