This area is now  a logged area, and it took me a while to get the nerve to go, and its hard to tell people what I have seen, and I told some hunting friends and they think I am full of ****and I don\u0092t care.  I seen what I seen, and its hard for me to figure that it was something else that could snap and shred a  tree at that height..the tree it was 30 ft. tall, and 18\u0094 in diameter girth, and just shredded at the 10-12ft point.
