This happened behind Wall Central School in the school field between Scott Farms development and the woods that connect to Woodfield Ave. There was back then 2 rows of pine trees that were between the school field and the Scott Farms neighborhood. It was behind 3407 and 3409 Brandon Road on the school field side.",

            "Observed": "I had some strange experiences in my childhood. A friend from up the street, she and I would walk through the woods. There was a path that went in a big circle where the older neighborhood kids would ride dirt bikes. It was about a mile around, I'd say. When we'd get about 2/3 the way around this 'circle' we'd hear single short whistles and small stones would be tossed near us. We thought it was the neighborhood kids, so kind of ignored it, but this would happen every time we walked around in this section of the woods. About 3/4 the way around the circle, we saw some matted down dry grass, that looked like a bedding area. Also, some strange footprints as well in the muddy areas. They were huge footprints and the toes seemed almost rectangular in the dried footprints. We'd also smell a wet dog type smell in this area. The last time I was in that section of the woods was 1975/1976.",

            "Follow-Up Report": " I was finally able to connect with the witness after many failed attempts. She had moved out of the area many years ago, but I was thrilled when I received a response from her saying that she would speak with me. We set up an appointment to speak by phone and she restated to me the events of that evening in fall of 1981.She also shared with me more details about her experiences with another friend dating back to the mid 70s when they would hike through the woods behind her friend\u0092s house, and would have pebbles tossed on the ground near them, and hear distinct whistles, and also found what appeared to be a nest off the trail in the woods. This nest was around 6'X6' and resembled a bedding area like those that gorillas make. The girls found some tracks near some homes under construction on the opposite side of the school field that were three times the size of their nine year old feet. They often smelled a wet dog odor in these woods and felt as if they were being watched at times, but kept this to themselves.She also told me about the times with another friend who would take her to the next town over to hang out in the woods near Allaire State park and they found large tracks that resembled the ones she and her other friend found near a neighborhood under construction on the opposite side of the school field. They also heard whistles while out there as well.She then told me about the encounter at the school, and how she and her boyfriend were hanging out smoking before he had to go home. She glanced over his shoulder and saw this shadowy creature standing across the field from them, and she cocked her head to get a better look. He noticed her quizzical expression just as the creature started running straight at them, and she yelled \"Run, Run!\" and bolted through the neighbor\u0092s backyard to her home. She didn't even know if he was with her until they got to her front door and they rushed inside shutting it behind them. She tried telling her mother to lock the doors, and her mom told her that she should not have been at the school at this hour. The next day Nancy and her boyfriend along with another friend drove over to the school, but she was so shaken by the previous night\u0092s events that she wouldn't even get out of the car and pleaded for them to leave. She never shared the events with anyone until many years later.She stated that it stood about 7 to 8ft tall, and that its hands were down to its knees. She recalled how the hair resembled the fur of an Irish Setter with curls near the wrists and knees, and that she could see leaves and other materials matted within it. She said it was auburn colored, and that she could see it clearly as it ran very quickly at them. It took very long strides, but she couldn't hear it hitting the ground. It was halfway to them in only a matter of a few seconds. She truly felt as though it meant them harm. I mentioned to her that it is what we commonly refer to as a \"Bluff charge\" and that its main objective was to scare them away, which it succeeded in doing. I also confirmed that the area she lived in was ideal for such an encounter, as it is within a mile of a large quarry and a reservoir, and very close to other large tracts of forest like Allaire SP. The town back then was much sparser, and had fewer homes than it does now.I found Nancy to be a very credible witness, and have no doubt that she had this encounter as a teenager. She agreed to allow us to use her first name and initial in the report. The area has had other reports filed over the years, and I have done many hikes in the Allaire State forest and have spoken with other individuals who have had strange events over the years. I therefore give this report a solid Class A rating.",
