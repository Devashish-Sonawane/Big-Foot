            "Observed": "I was 11 or 12 at the time. I was at a boyscout Jamboree. My friend came to me and asked if I beleived in bigfoot. He then told me to follow him because he saw a bigfoot. We walked about a half mile to the rivers edge. Accross the river we watched what looked like a large gorilla like creature about 6 ft tall standing next to the river picking leaves off a bush and eating them. We watched for a couple minutes until it walked into the brush and disappeared. It was not a bear. It picked the leaves off the tree just as a human would. We stayed in the area as much as possible the next few days but never saw it again.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness offered the following additional observations during a phone interview:\u0095\tThe sighting occurred along the Dearborn River not far from where it joins the Missouri River.\u0095\tThe animal was on the opposite bank of the river from the boys about 100 yards away.\u0095\tThe animal stood with its back to the boys, apparently unaware they were watching.\u0095\tThe animal stood upright.\u0095\tIt was black in color.\u0095\tIt used its hands, not together to gather and pull leaves to its mouth, but individually to pluck and put leaves into its mouth.\u0095\tThe witness is an avid big game hunter. He was certain the animal was not a bear or a man. If it was a man he was in a bigfoot suit, the witness said. And he did not believe it was a man in a suit because he thought a hoax would have been staged much differently. No one else at the Boy Scout jamboree saw it.\u0095\tWhen asked what the animal was if not a bear or a man, the witness would not say \u0093bigfoot\u0094 or \u0093sasquatch,\u0094 though it was clear that is what he thought he saw.\u0095\tThe whereabouts of the friend who first saw the creature are unknown. There is no question in my mind that the witness was being honest. He and his friend saw an animal that stood picking and eating leaves along the Dearborn River using its hands. It is reminiscent of the Bauman story.",
