            "Observed": "I was coming home from my girlfriend's house around 12:00 a.m. or 12:30 a.m. I was a junior or senior in high school (2002/2003) at the time. My house is situated outside of a small town in Henderson County, Illinois. My girlfriend's house is located outside of a small town about 12 miles from mine. I was about 1/2 a mile away from my house going down a large rural hill when I casually saw about 15-20 cows grazing and sleeping along a treeline. They all had the same white eyes on all the same level. I then noticed about 3-4 feet above a row of cows 2 menacing yellow eyes. It seemed to look very strange to me, and I had a high powered flash light in my car. I backed my car up, and opened my car door. As soon as I opened my car door, the eyes moved about 4-6 feet to \"its\" right in a very quick instant. I knew this was no raccoon or opossum, and I decided to jump in my car and take off. As soon as I pulled in my drive way, I took out my large flashlight and decided to walk down the road with my very large part grand mastiff/st. bernard. Within walking 150-200 feet down the road my large dog started to growl, but did not run after whatever it was growling at. My dog chases anything that comes around the house, as he has no natural predator out there, and loves to chase off coyotes from the surrounding fields by my parent's house. I tried to move the flashlight towards the direction of the barking, but I saw nothing. I walked back to my house, still looking back, but saw nothing else. My dog just followed myself home. I will never forget those yellow eyes, and I have told other people my story, and I'd even heard of few people that have heard strange things late at night. The only somewhat large wild animals in this area are coyotes, and thats it. No bears or wolves are found in this part of the country (Illinois). As with our county, there was word when I was in grade school of a few bobcats being released in the northern part of the county, but this was no bobcat.",

            "Other Stories": "My freshman or sophmore year at college, my mother called me one day and stated that she couldn't sleep one night, and went to the back of the house to sit in a sofa/recliner, and was just taking in the scenery on a great night. We have great big windows that show our backyard, pasture, and 2 large cornfields to the West and North. My mother said all of a sudden our two dogs went crazy in the house, and wanted out. So my mom let them out the back door, and turned on the back porch light. She said she saw something very large jump over our backyard fence and into the pasture, and take off northwest through the field. My mother was a high school teacher for years, and I believe what she saw. For some reason, however, as I've read stories, my dogs wanted to try and go after the person or \"thing\" and my mother said they didn't seem to be afraid.",

            "Observed": "i went fishing with my girlfriend at stumpy meadows last winter. we been up their about five days out of the week. early in the morning we would arrive try to get the line in the water as much as possible. the rest of the time i would be looking for gold. we mostly stuck around the dam and the spillway. my gold fever and wanting to catch a trout with my fly poll got me to wonder down along the spill way. the hole time i couldn\u0092t shake the bad filling i had well we had. it was the hair on the back of your neck being watched felling. i was at the vary bottom of the spillway in the middle of the stream standing on a rock fishing. my girlfriend was about twenty feet away panning. she said something lick lets get otta here something\u0092s watching us. i told her i was catching it for awhile now to. so we climbed out of our little spot and onto a service rode that ran along the spillway. the hole time rubbernecking left right and especially behind us .some thing was putting the creep on us and was getting closer. we were walking as fast as you could without running or looking like you were scared sh**liss .but we both knew if one or the other broke and made for the car you might be last. so we held our ground and walked as casually as could be. i informed her that something was up on the other side of the spillway the hole time we were their watching us. and it was keeping pace with us as we made our way up the steep road. the thing behind us came from down bellow us on the same side of the stream and it was following just far enough not to be seen. we would stop it would stop. im a native american from auburn, and some of my relatives live in foresthill. and ive spent many nights with my cousins hunting though hills. I\u0092ve been followed by mountain cities a couple times. so i know the experience when that\u0092s the case. this was not the case sadly, if you were there you could say sadly, i would much rather a cat follow me somehow. but just in case it was a cat driving us or not. i told her to lock and load. that usually does the trick for the hiby jibys but not this time. the things present made my firearm fill like it was a rubber band and folded paper, and extra weight for when she bolted before me to the car. the last twenty feet to the car was easy. the thing had stopped about seventy feet before the car i stood watch as she loaded the car in record speed. a inflatable two man canoe four fishing poles ice chest, tackle, fit in the back set of my camero some how in thirty seconds. we pulled out of the entrance way and on to the road in the middle of the dam. it was dark by now  no cars nothing all day. we got out to gather ourselves and unload and put away the pistols, while she did that i walked back towered the spillway something big and black came up and around the spillway and up the other side of the hill were the other thing was. i was about one hundred feet from were they were. i didn\u0092t feel the fear as before. in a gap between some cwaycky brush one large thing and two smaller things followed. i yelled \u0093hey\u0094 loudly. the things gurgled some what back at me. they kept this up as they walked up over the hill from me. it was some what like four quick gereag gereag gereag gerags, than lick two than a couple more. than they some what repeated the same sequence again. all the while  walking up over the crest of the hill, into the darkness. it reminded me of a mother giving me a tongue lashing or her children one after a close call. well thats what i related it to, but what was fact is it was talking something. im not to certain on the right number of individual words there were but it definitely was in some sort of sentence structure, stopped than repeated again.",
