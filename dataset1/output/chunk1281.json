            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness over the phone. I know her Mother, who has attended many Washington State BFRO expeditions. The pertinent items that I gathered from talking with her are these. That her head was against the fabric of the tent, and she felt that she was touched/stroked on top of her head. While she was being touched on the top of her head she felt unable to move her body or limbs. That the end of the tent was lifted up by two feet, and then lowered gently down. Finally, there were rock-clacking sounds from nearby as well as further away.The following weekend, a group of us were already scheduled to be in that area for a camp-out/sasquatching trip. I took that opportunity to go visit that site. There was someone else occupying that camp-site, so we did not stop and look around. However, viewing the site and the surrounding terrain and forest was helpful in understanding the events. The jack-pine forest comes right up close to that campsite, and the trees grow very close together. There is a lot of ground cover that would allow a close approach. The terrain at this location is fairly level.The presence of clacking is something that is often heard when sasquatches are close by. They seem to signal each other with rock clacks (which may be teeth popping), or by stick tapping. What occurred here indicates that there were several individuals around the camp-site. Possibly one standing as lookout while the other approached closer.In this area, we have had many reports from researchers with respect to being touched. Several people have had their thigh poked, or grasped through the fabric of the tent. I know of one other person who had the top of their head touched as was reported by this witness. These occurrences also have happened at other locations in the Pacific Northwest.The tent being lifted up and then gently placed back down is something new to me. However, tents have been pushed down on, and fingers poked into, as well as hands and fingers being raked along or down the fabric. This behavior does not surprise me.She wrote that in the morning, she and her son went outside to look for tracks, and found none. This can be explained if the creature was quadruped at the time. It is very unclear what their tracks look like in that mode. Most people look for the normal giant human-shaped footprints. It would be difficult for someone who is not expecting something different to recognize knuckle prints or toe prints.The experience that this witness reports is very common in this area in particular, and often experienced at other places. Such behavior has often been reported during BFRO expeditions. In addition, there was a phoned-in report from Goose Prairie during the same week, where a Sasquatch crossed the road in front of one of the residents.",

The creature looked prehistoric. It was very shocking to see and watch a bigfoot. Most recently, a teenage boy saw a bigfoot in the same Woodville, TX area. My son has told me one night something that stunk came close to the house by the bedroom where he was sleeping. Whatever it was moaned and groaned and he could hear it breathing.
