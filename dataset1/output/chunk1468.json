            "Observed": "My story begins in the early part of June when I took a job at Josephine Creek Lodge.  My first sighting was on an after work excursion with my friend.  On June 16, 2001, we went bouldering at a place known as House Rock.  When we arrived, we noticed four prints, three entering and one exiting the sheltered area.  They were approximately 16 inches in length.  The ground was sandy and you could see digits.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On the evening of September 30, 2001, I talked with Joss W. about his sighting and the track observations that he and some of his friends had made between June and August of 2001, in the Trinity National forest, of California.  Bearing in mind that Joss grew up, and he now lives and works in this area of California. On his first track observation while rock climbing June 16, 2001, he and his friend Jeff saw four tracks at a place called House Rock which is a series of large boulders that have a cave like entrance and interior. They observed three 16-inch tracks that were heading into the cave, and one 16-inch track that was headed out of the cave.  The track that was headed out had the second toe longer than the first three tracks, and in Joss\u2019s opinion, it was a different animal track.  On the second track observation June 23,2001 in the same area, Joss and his female companion were back-packing into the same area, when they came across two 16-inch tracks that crossed their trail at a perpendicular angle, and were headed straight up a steep embankment. Joss\u2019s friend saw the tracks, but didn\u2019t make any comments at that time.On the third and last track observation, which was on or about August 9, 2001, Joss went fishing on the Salmon River, close to the Big Flat campground, where he again came across two more 16-inch tracks with five toes. These tracks were very fresh in the gravelly riverbed. The stride between the tracks was approximately five and a half feet long. This time, Joss had a camera with him and he took a few pictures of them.  On July 27, 2001, Joss had his brief sighting with an eight to nine foot tall bigfoot creature as he and a friend James were heading back north to his camp at the Big Flat c/g, from his job at the Josephine Creek Lodge, in his truck on the Coffee Creek Road. As he and James entered a series of S-curves in the road which he could see through to the far side, the creature walked across the road. It then made one step in the middle of the road, and turned to take a quick look at the moving vehicle, then it turned and continued on up a steep incline on the other side of the road, and it was moving as fast as a mountain lion, going from the west to the east.  Joss asked James, \u201cDid you see that?\u201d But no, James missed seeing the creature altogether.  After words, they were too scared to stop and check for prints.I asked Joss W. the following questions on his sighting of the creature:* Where did this incident occur? \u201c It took place on the Coffee Creek Rd. between Josephine Creek Lodge and the Big Flat c/g.  We were headed north, and were in some S-curves.\u201d* What date did this take place? \"I think it was on July 27, 2001.\u201d\";\t* Was it day or night? \u201cIt was about 6:30 PM, just before dusk.\u201d* Were you alone when you first saw this? \u201cNo, I had my friend James with me.\u201d* Describe the area in which this incident occurred. \u201cIt was at about 6000 feet, and this area has douglas fir, and silvertip trees, and cedar trees, with many granite rocks and boulders.\u201d\t* What distance would you estimate you were from this thing when you first saw it? \u201cWe were about eighty yards away, when it stepped out onto the road.\u201d* What was your first reaction? \u201cI was surprised, and I asked my friend James, who was sitting next to me, \u201cDid you see that?\u201d  He said, \u201cWhat!\u201d And he missed the whole episode.\u201d* What was it doing? \u201cAs it was walking across the road, it must have heard us and it turned and looked directly at the truck.  When it did, I noticed two sets of eyes glowing from the headlights. The critter was holding a small spotted fawn in its left arm like a football. The fawn had to be alive, because its ears stood up and it also seemed to notice us too. Then it turned and went up a steep incline on the other side of the road like a six million dollar man.\u201d\t* Did it stand and walk on two legs? \u201cIt was moving on two legs the whole time that I saw it.\u201d* Did you see it go down on all fours? \u201cNo, it never went down on all fours.\u201d* Was it covered in hair? \u201cYes!\u201d * What color was it? \u201cIt looked like a mat black, not shiny like a bear.\u201d* How tall would you estimate this thing to have been? \u201cI am going to revise my first estimate, and make its height between eight and nine feet tall.\u201d* What would you estimate its weight to have been? \u201c I would guess it weighed between three hundred fifty to four hundred pounds.\u201d* Did you see any facial features, and can you describe them? \u201cI think so. The eyes were set back, and it had a protruding eyebrow ridge. The face looked like a primate face to me and it was hairy.  Also, I noticed the head was shaped like a cone, and it seemed like the jaw and lower lip were protruding.\u201d* Did you observe any ears? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t remember any ears.\u201d* Could you describe the arms? \u201cThe arms seemed long and hairy and the forearm looked like Popeye\u2019s. The left arm was holding a fawn and that hand was around the fawn\u2019s neck.\u201d* Could you tell if it was a male or a female? \u201cNo! The chest had no mammary glands, and it looked solid and hairy.\u201d* For about how long did you see it? \u201cI would say less than three seconds.\u201d* Did it ever make any noise?  \u201cNothing that we could hear, besides we were in my truck with the radio turned on.\u201d\t* Did it see you? \u201cYes, it turned and looked at the truck, that\u2019s when the spotted fawn lifted its ears and I observed both sets of eyes glowing from my headlight reflections.\u201d * Did you smell anything? \u201cNo!\u201d* Did you check for footprints?  \u201cNo, we never slowed down, I was too scared.\u201d* Did you report what you saw?  (IE) Like your parents or any agency? \u201cOnly told my friends and parents.\u201d * What was their response? \u201cThey were surprised especially when I showed them the photos. Before all of this took place, I was always a skeptic about there being a bigfoot creature.\u201dIn summary: When Joss and his friends were camping in this area they also heard high pitched screaming and other strange sounds but they just put it off to normal forest sounds.  Joss reiterated his previous report, and he seemed to me to be very credible in his rendition of that report. Joss and his friends have seen many bears in and around that area, and he knows what they look like. He now carries a small bell with him to keep the bears away from him and his friends while backpacking.   After my conversation with Joss, I have come to the conclusion that he observed a bigfoot animal on Coffee Creek Road in late July of 2001.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the son who saw the animal.  He described it as being \"a big hairy thing.\" His impression was that the animal was standing upright, as a human would, that it was very tall, and that it was \"peeking\" at him from behind the family garage.The sighting occurred at nighttime but a yard light was on and provided illumination. The witness saw what he thought was the head and shoulder of the animal as it leaned out from behind the building. He was unable to make out any facial features, however, and said he could not even be certain that the animal was facing him, but the \"peeking\" behavior made him think it was. He described the head as round and thought the animal was covered with \"hair.\" The sighting frightened the witness and he immediately withdrew into the house and so he did not see the animal leave.The witness was quite sure that what he saw was not a bear. He said he'd never seen a bear in the area, that the very tall, upright posture was un-bear-like, and that it just didn't look like a bear.  At the time of the sighting the witness said he didn't have any idea of what he was seeing. That unknownquality seems to be what made the experience so frightening to him. Only afterward, when the family members discussed the episode, did they arrive at the conclusion that it must have been a bigfoot.The witness is now a serviceman. He seemed absolutely truthful and I have no doubt that his experience was real.",
