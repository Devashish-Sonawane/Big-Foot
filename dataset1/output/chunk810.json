            "Follow-Up Report": "I called the witness so she could fill me in on what she found on her property. It just so happened that I was headed down that way the next day to attend the Oregon Sasquatch Symposium. We met the witness the next morning. This witness is known to me and we have been talking for a couple of years, although this is the first report she has filed. Previously, when something was happening, she would just call me, but was not willing to file a written report. This person and her husband are long term habituation witnesses. Sasquatches are seen and heard frequently on the property. These sasquatches seem to have a fondness and curiosity about this person. However, they do not like her dogs very much, and both of them have been injured in the past. They have about 15 acres, which they had logged last year.Two weeks before, the first week of June 2011, the witness and one of her friends were out on the trails in the logged -over forest behind the house. While they were walking, they noticed that piles of rocks had been added to the pet cemetery. (There is a small patch of their property that they kept from being logged two years ago, and the witness has a cemetery for her past pets there.) Then, after walking about 50 feet further, they spotted some little bundles of grass about 2 inches long by 1 inch wide. There were 10 of them. Five had been piled up in a little stack, and five were arranged in a straight line. She did not take pictures. Her dogs then became agitated, as they usually do when a squatch is near. She reached over to pet the head of one of the dogs, when suddenly a rock was thrown at the dog. Instead of hitting the dog, it hit her right thumb, causing a cut. Her friend by now was really freaked out and wanted to get back to the house. The witness picked up the rock and the green bundles of grass and took them back to the house. They treated the cut, and then they decided to see what was inside the bundles of grass. When they took one apart, they found a field mouse inside. They took a closer look at the others, and they all appear to have field mice in them, wrapped in grass like little mummies. She put them on a piece of cardboard, and then in a freezer bag and froze them. She gave them to me after we got there.  I also took pictures of the rock piles, the area where the mice were found, the rock that was thrown, and the cut on her hand. I suggested that the mice might have been a gifting, and that she should give them something in return.  She said she would do that. We searched around the area thoroughly, and found some trees that had been pushed over to block the skid road access to the back of the property. In a muddy area, we found a small barefoot footprint, which was rained out, but the outline was visible. It was eight inches long. We also found a track line of adult sasquatch impressions. There were 4 impressions that I could see. These also had been rained out, so there was not much detail, but they measured about 15 inches long. I photographed these. Two weeks later, she called me. Her husband had placed a bag of three apples about 10 feet up in a vine maple tree the day before. There was a suspicious branch break which they though might be squatch related. This is where they put the bag of apples. He had to use a stick to place the apples on the end of the branch break. The next morning, when she went out to check on the apples she found that the corner of the bag had been torn open and two apples were missing. On the ground, exactly where the mice had been placed, she found an apple that had been 80% eaten, and then put down. The bag was still in the tree and one apple could be seen. She recovered the apple core and put it in the freezer to keep it for me. I immediately drove down there to get the apple core. I also looked over the area with the witness and her husband. The ground is hard-packed, so no track impressions were visible. We found the other apple in the crotch of the maple tree. It had been pecked at by birds. Examining the apple core, what can be seen are teeth impressions. They are larger than human teeth, but smaller that a full grown sasquatch. There is a ridge down the center of each tooth, and there is a gap between each of the top front teeth. I was able to cut the apple in two, and cast each side. I had to hurry, as the apple was not lasting. We suspect that an adult sasquatch got an apple from the bag and gave it to a juvenile. This picture is the rock that was thrown, and the witness\u0092s thumb which had been cut. You can see the healed scar.This picture is of the mice wrapped in grass. This is not something a person would likely do, yet it required a certain amount of skill and dexterity. This picture is of the piles of rocks in the pet cemetery. There were three piles like this which were not placed there by the witness.This is the vine maple tree showing the branch break. It was here where mice were found, and also where the apples were placed, and the partially eaten apple was recovered.This is the small impression. The cell phone is 4 inches long.This is the large impression. There was a faintly visible track line at this location.This picture shows the bag of apples in place in the tree. One has been removed, another was found at the base of this tree, and the partially eaten apple was found on the trail nearby.These two pictures are of the casting of the apple core showing from two angles. There are at least three of the top front teeth visible. Based on the past history of this location, as well as the immediate evidence of the mice, apple core, rock piles, and track impressions, I can only conclude that a sasquatch was making a gift to the witness. I am sure there will be more activity to report at a later date, as the activity continues.",
