To be brief, it was in the late fall, my husband and I were camping, at about 0400 we heard a strange animal call. It was a roaring, warbling, guttural yodeling sound that included a high pitched scream element. We heard the call 4 or 5 times in succession, then all was quiet. The sound was between 800 to 1000 meters from our camp.",
