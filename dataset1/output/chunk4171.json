            "Observed.1  ": "\"It had long legs, a head like a gorilla with long, dark brown, furry hair that was in layers. The thing was very graceful. I would say it would weigh about 600 pounds. It crossed the road from north to south and I would estimate it was running about 35 miles an hour. I saw it for maybe four or five seconds,\" said Padilla. The creature kept his face faced in the direction he was running, Padilla said. When asked if the incident frightened him, Padilla answered with a slow \"No.\" and then added, \"I was more curious than anything else. It didn't pay the least bit of attention to me or my car.\" A check of the area Tuesday by Padilla, Jay W. Barker of North Ogden and photographer John Shupe failed to uncover any tracks. The highway sides, however, were solid grass and weeds and fields in the area were hard or planted in alfalfa and even the footprints of the men did not show, said Barker. ONE FIELD  \"There was one plowed field on the north side, but we didn't find any tracks in it,\" said Barker who also reported seeing the creature together with three other men and several boys three years ago in the Uinta Mountains. Padilla said after the creature crossed out of the headlight beams, he turned down a small, dirt sideroad and directed the beam of his headlights across the field hoping he could follow and spot the creature again. The headlight beams didn't spot the creature, Padilla said, but they did attract the attention of a state highway trooper who drove up and asked him what was going on. When the trooper was told what had taken place,\" he took off in a hurry and I got the impression he was going to also look for it,\" said Padilla. The witness said the creature had long arms and was very erect as it ran across the highway. Padilla said the creature \"moved gracefully\" and not in the manner usually attributed to the slouch and swinging gait of a gorilla or member of the ape family. Padilla said the area where the creature crossed is farmland with open fields and little cover. FEW MILES  The location is only a few miles from where sightings were reported and tracks of \"bigfoot\" found early in February in South Weber outside the mouth of Weber Canyon and near the Weber River. Meanwhile, in an unrelated incident seven years ago, Craig R. Johnson, told of strange happenings that my [sic] have involved a \"bigfoot\" in the Manti-La Sal Mountains. Johnson said he and friends had pitched camp with their horses for a elk hunt. During the night, \"something very powerful\" lifted off a 300-pound horse trailer door and tossed it seven to 10 feet away. An imprint in the dust on the door was checked by a local bear hunter who said it was not that of a bear, and nothing like he had ever seen before. WAS AWAY  Johnson also said when the hunting party was away from camp the next day, \"something\" bit down on a full beer can left standing in a wheel well. The bite split the can and the beer was dripping out when the group returned. \"The thing that was funny was the fact the beer can showed teeth marks, but was not punctured, just split. Whatever bit it also replaced it in the exact spot it had been left,\" added Johnson. He said although the horses tied to the same trailer made a small disturbance during the night, \"it was nothing like they would have done if a bear had gotten that close.\"",

            "Observed.1  ": "Mr. Barker and his two sons Brent, 12, and Danny, 6, had hiked to the top of the ridge between Pass Lake and Cuberant Basin at the head of Weber River drainage. They reached the top of the ridge at noon Monday and made contact with Larry Beeson and his three sons, Scott, 14, Michael, 11, David, 5, and Paul Carling, 14. About that time, they looked down upon a small alpine lake about one half mile below them and saw the creature standing on its edge.  Creature Turns  At first, Mr. Barker thought he was looking at an elk. Then the creature turned to look up at the party after a couple of the boys had knocked rocks loose that rolled. \"What are we looking at?\" said an amazed Mr. Beeson as the creature turned and walked off on its hind legs. Mr. Barker said the distance was too far to get a good look at the creature's face, but he said it moved through scattered trees, turning its head back to look at them from time to time.  Four Minutes  He said they watched it for some four minutes while it covered about one half mile through the scattered trees and then disappeared into heavy timber. Startled and almost dumbfounded, the group stared. \"That thing is standing on two legs,\" said one member of the amazed party as they looked. Mr. Barker said the party went down to where they had seen the creature after it disappeared. They found \"paw-like\" imprints in the earth, but the ground was too hard and dry to leave a clear imprint. He said the paw mark was \"huge\" and resembled that made by a palm and toes. The party followed the path of the creature to the timber and found other scruff marks on the rocks and in the dry ground and grass.  Heavy Timber  Mr. Barker said the group thought better about following the hairy creature into the heavy timber. Excited and unable to sleep, Mr. Barker said he and his boys were too tired after their experience to make the return trip of over six miles back to their camper near Pass Lake. They spent Monday night huddled about a campfire at Fish Lake near where the creature had been seen and came out Tuesday. Mr. Barker estimated the elevation of the small lake where the creature was seen at about 12,000 feet. It was above the timberline.  Sheep Scared  He also said a sheepherder in the Gold Hills area below, Arlo Fawcett of Roy, reported he has been unable to get his sheep to stay in the area where the creature was seen. Mr. Fawcett reportedly said he would take his sheep into the area to graze, and they would beat him back to camp, apparently filled with fear. The herder also said it's the first summer this has happened. It's also the first summer that he has failed to see or hear coyotes in the area. Utah wildlife officials, informed of the incident, said they would ride into the area on horses to check the area.  Fits Grizzly  Jerry Dahlberg, conservation officer, northern region, Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, when informed of the creature, said the description fits a grizzly bear \"to a T,\" all except walking upright for such a long distance. Officer Dahlberg says he plans a horseback trip into the area over the Labor Day weekend. Mr. Beeson said when they reached the area where the hairy creature was seen, they found the carcass of a rabbit that had been completely \"skinned as by a human\" and partially eaten. ",
