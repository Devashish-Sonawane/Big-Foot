            "Observed": "My husband and I were out quading up by Stumpy Meadows, that is up out of Georgetown, California.  I have lived in that area for roughly 40 years.  I have smelt some awful smells up there in the woods.  This day my husband and I rode down this one road and found out it didn't go anywhere, so we turned around and rode back out.  I went out ahead of him, I got far enough ahead that I couldn't see him when turned to look to see if he was following.  Anyway I stopped to wait for him. I thought I smelt someting dead, or  like something peed there more then once. It was a really strong smell.  My first thought was a bear.  While  I was sitting there looking around I got this wierd feeling that some one was watching me.  I was really getting scared, I always carry a 44 mag with me, so I figure I can be pretty much safe when I'm out there, but not this time.  I decided to go find my husband, as I started my quad up I heard a branch break.  I'm still thinking bear, but the smell was awful. I started to pull away and I looked down and there over the tracks we made earlier going down the road were the biggest footprints I have ever seen, then I knew that was no bear. I took off, I got about ten feet down the road when my husband pulled up.  He looked at me and said what's up?, you see a snake? So I showed him the tracks. Now my husband is the type of guy that would have to be knocked down by a bigfoot before he would believe.  Then still he would say it was something else. He said that because the road was so dusty that the prints  looked larger then they actually were.  He said he didn't smell anything but a faint smell of something dead.  I wanted to believed him.  I never went back to that area again.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness on August 17, 2005, and can add the following details to the report:\u0095 The witness noted that the woods were really quiet. She remembers thinking at the time that it was so quiet that it was not normal.\u0095 She lifted the face mask of her helmet and then smelled the stench. The witness struggled to describe the smell. She said it was worse than a male goat smell, something like buck brush, very \u0093pissy\u0094 and ten times worse than a fox den. The witness used to hunt bears and the smell was very different from them. She repeatedly stated that the smell burnt her nose.\u0095 The sensation of being watched made the witness very uneasy. She said the best way to describe the feeling is \u0093it felt like hatred.\u0094 She got the distinct impression that she was not wanted there. The sensation made her frightened, almost panicky.\u0095 The footprints were made between the times she and her husband drove in and when they drove out \u0096 probably no more than 10 or 20 minutes. Her quad ran over half of two separate footprints, the front half of the first one (leaving just the heel) and the back half of the second one (leaving the toes visible). Because of this, no overall length can be given of the print, but the width at the ball was approximately eight inches. Her quad running the prints over would indicate a step length of something like four feet.\u0095 The second print (the one with the toes) was intact enough to notice that a flat foot with no evidence of an arch made the print. She looked for, but did not find, evidence of hair impressions in the fine dust around the toes as one often finds with bear prints.\u0095 The area was thick with pine trees and manzanita that prevented a clear view into the forest.",

            "Observed": "In 2002, in early fall (it was still nice outside) I was driving to work.  Ahead of me, on the crest of a hill, I saw a creature crossing the road.  It did not remind me of a monkey.  The legs and torso were too long.  It was on all fours at first; the limbs were substantial.  It was covered with dark brown longish hair.  It started across the road on all fours; the back limbs looked about the same length as the front limbs.  It was not great big and bulky; however it was of considerable size.  There was quite a bit of room between the stomach area and the ground.  Very tall in that way.  After a few steps, it stood up and took a couple of huge running steps, as if trying to hurry up.  Then it leaped up over about a 6'  embankment and a fence.  I went back later on after work to the site, and there were numerous footprints of all kinds of game; obviously it was a frequently used crossing for all sorts of animals.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness, S. P., is a forty year old mother of seven who has lived in rural settings most of her life. She was quite excited to talk about the sighting, which lasted four to five seconds. When first seen, the animal was on the shoulder of the road, traveling north to south. It was moving on all fours. Just past the middle of the road, it rose up on its rear limbs and disappeared into the woods with a few steps, leaning forward slightly. The animal was described as very fast and graceful. When S. P. wrote in her submission that it didn\u0092t look like a monkey, she meant that it didn\u0092t look like an orangutan or chimpanzee. That is, \u0093it didn\u0092t have their short squatty legs.\u0094  The animal she saw had long hind legs and she emphasized that all the limbs were very broad and heavy looking, not slender. When on all fours, the back was parallel with the ground. The animal had no tail and no snout, but she couldn\u0092t see any details of the face. The creature was described as being much larger than a deer, but the thing that really caught her eye was that \u0093it was so tall\u0094 when it stood upright. She made reference to the great height of the animal several times. When I asked her what her initial thoughts were regarding what she had seen, she replied that she \u0093was at a loss.\u0094 Sasquatch was not considered as she researched possible species because of the quadrupedal mode of locomotion observed as it began to cross the highway. Like the witness, I'm unable to suggest a source for misidentification. As far as I know, there are only a few records of adult sasquatch walking on all fours, but I found S. P. to be a credible witness and am convinced she saw something highly unusual that August morning. ",
