            "Observed": "My sister and I were driving North on Hwy 67 just past Rushville, Illinois. It was about 3 am, we came up on a part of the road that veered left in a wooded area.  I saw an image up ahead in the road so I started to slow down. At first I thought it was a big big bear but I realized it was slimmer with very broad shoulders and black. It was bending down standing on the back legs, it picked something up out of the road with great care, looked right up at us and then took off so fast in the woods on its two back legs standing up caring for whatever it was that it picked up. My lights shined on it, it was not a bear. I've never seen an animal like that before and I have traveled the roads a lot. I've been hesitant to say anything because it just sounds crazy but it still bothers me because I don't know what it was. My sister saw it as well.",

He heard one loud vocalization exactly like the third one in the video and it echoed down the canyon. He estimates it was fifty to one hundred yards away and said, \"it felt like a zoo lion roar in his chest. It seemed like it had the power from a 900 pound animal.\" The hair on the back of his neck stood.After the rain stopped, he smelled an odor like a wet dog and urine for about an hour. He did not leave. There were other campers around but he did not talk to any of them.He has heard bear, elk, cougar, etc. but this was powerful and different. He has fished this area a lot and always wondered if it was a Bigfoot. We cannot verify what made the vocalization in the similar recording that he provided. ",
