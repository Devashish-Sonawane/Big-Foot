After about 10 minutes waiting for one of my friends to come back from a possible stone formation, I was looking uphill and saw a head peaking around a hickory tree and brush. It was moving back and forth from around the tree. There was a lot of dead tree fall and vegetation between us but it appeared to be sitting on the ground.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This observation happened while some BFRO investigators were scouting the areas around Honobia prior to the 2008 Oklahoma expedition, which took place near Honobia. The witness, Texas BFRO Investigator Jerry Durand, called me while he could still see the animal. The following details can be added: Two people were able to observe an apparent juvenile bigfoot, in daylight, just outside the Kiamichi Mountain town of Honobia. The figure appeared to be less than 6 feet tall, but it had very broad shoulders. Its hair color made it stand out in the daylight. Its hair was reddish and spiky in places, and was a couple of inches longer around the head and neck area. Its face was rounded and flat with hair covering the cheeks and chin area. Its eyes were big, round and dark. There was not a prominent brow ridge. Some of the features were obscured by hair. The arms were 36 to 38 inches in length and were lanky and lean. It was sitting or squatting behind rocks, trees and brush that were roughly 3 feet tall. The length of observation was 15 to 20 minutes. Impressions and a possible wood knocking \"station\" were found 50 yards from the spot.Both witnesses are experienced in tracking and field investigations. Several other incidents occurred within a few miles of this spot during the 2008 Oklahoma Expedition.Comments from witness added on 11/07/08:\"No there are not any photos.Yes I had a camera, I always carry a camera.However, the camera was on the bottom of my pack.Background-As I saw the creature, what I believe to be a juvenile, I did not want to take my eyes of of it. After I called TH over to see it, I removed my pack and began to search blindly for the camera. I couldn't feel it so I radioed my wife to look in my truck and make sure I didn't leave it there. (She turned the radio off because of static). I refused to take my eyes off of Nubbie, as we are referring to it. I concentrated on observing every detail I could so as to file a report. Plus you never know how long you will be able to see a sighting of this nature. When we finally lost sight of Nubbie for good, I searched my pack and my camera was there. I was hot, fit to be tied.\"The artist sketch below was created using the witnesses description.",
