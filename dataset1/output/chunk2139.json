Upon reaching Susanville, CA we had a hard time buying gasoling because it was during the shortage.  We decided due to the desolate nature of the road we would be driving it would be better to go back home.  We felt many gas stations would be closed and we couldn't get fuel when we needed it.  Anyway, we were driving west on 299 when from our left a reddish-tan (more tan than red) image stepped onto the roadway and in two strides was over the road and into the ravine on the right side of the road.  It was only illuminated in our headlights briefly and the sighting was only a few seconds.  My husband and I hadn't been talking and after a minute or so my husband said \"Did you see that?\".  His question confirmed to me that I indeed saw what I thought I saw.  I would estimate the bigfoot to be about 7' tall.",
