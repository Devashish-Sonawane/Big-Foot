Well the raspberry bushes in between had a trailer in front of them, and the main house in front of the trailer.  One incident occured when someone was cooking in the trailer and found themselves from the story I was told looking eye to eye with bigfoot.  The person was in shock, lying under the bed, and the other person in the kitchen with them ran to the window after the person who made eye contact ran.  the second person saw the rear of the animal and it was hairy.  They never said if it was on all fours, or on two feet.  But the window in the trailer was at least 7 foot off the ground outside.",
