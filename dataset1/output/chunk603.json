Exact location unknown, because I was kind of just following the car in front of me, driving on \"auto pilot.\"  It was very foggy and we were both going about 30-35 mph.  Suddenly, the car in front of me slammed on the brakes, and I did the same.  Running across the road in front of the car in front of me, in about only two strides, was a large black figure, about seven feet tall, with long arms; humanoid form, thinner body type.  I can't be sure but I believe it was hair or fur-covered, not clothing. It appeared and disappeared very quickly because of the fog.  When I passed by the area into which it ran, I saw nothing.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After visiting with the witness it seemed as though her observations were a sincere and honest account of what she saw in March.  She was a couple of car lengths behind the car before her that missed the creature by only a couple yards. She said it was definitely on two legs running like a sprinter, very fast, with long, fast swinging arms.  Not much detail was seen due to the fog, but she was able to observe that the creature was all black with no clothing breaks. It had a very short neck and a proportionally smaller head to the body size.  No noticeable snout or nose, only viewing the profile, it never looked towards the cars or turned sideways. Wide shoulders compared to the rest of its skinny body, estimating the height to be 7 - 7 1/2 ft. tall and its weight to be about 220 pounds. She was most struck by the long length of the arms that appeared to swing at or below the knee, and the long fast stride that the creature used to quickly cross the road in just a couple strides. I visited the site on May 16 and found the exact location of the crossing with the help of some very good landmarks from the witness. I drove around many of the back roads nearby, the area has much more wilderness and remoteness than the maps or aerial phtotos would suggest, having many of the habitat requirements we have come to associate with bigfoots.

            "Observed": "On September 1st, 2011 I was camping up in the beautiful Cascade Mountains of Washington State with my friend Dave (my name is Dave as well). We got there early on Thursday to get the spot we wanted. It was for us the start of the Labor Day weekend. We had set up camp and drove up an old logging road to get our firewood for the night. There is a bridge close to our campsite. We had supper and relaxed around the campfire. At about 10:30 that night I decided to grab a flashlight and go looking around the area across the bridge. I really had not planned on looking for Bigfoot as I was busy with the logistics of putting this camping trip together. I am a true believer in Sasquatch, and read Bigfoot stories all the time(ask my wife). As I cleared the bridge there is a dead-end road on the right that goes down for about a quarter mile or so. I know this because I have been down there. The road is gated at the top with a pipe gate. In the middle of the gate is a red reflector. I could not see the reflector because something was standing in front of it. I had shined my just regular flashlight, with about \u00be battery power down this road. What I did see was a pair of big yellow eyes, looking back at me. I FROZE. I remember thinking: Oh My GOD! I noticed that the right eye was much brighter than the left eye. I thought that perhaps there was some hair hanging down over the inside of the left eye. Or maybe it had an injury. I then noticed how far apart the eyes were. And how high up from the ground they were. Actually they were roughly even with mine, but the road there sloped down a bit. About four feet or more! I\u0092m 5\u00928\u0094 on a good day. This \u0093thing\u0094 would have towered over me! The creature was either dark brown or black, as I could not make out any body or head features at all. Just those yellow eyes. There was no odor at all. The air was perfectly still. It made no noise either. I processed all this very quickly. If it would have growled at me it would have been laundry time! We stared at each other for maybe 10-12 seconds. It seemed to kind of lean side to side a little. Without moving its feet. Then the eyes dropped down a little and made a big circle. Pause. Then another circle same as the first. Like an owl, only way bigger. I thought that he had put his hands on his knees maybe. Kind of like I have seen on TV of apes moving.It looked at me for 3 more seconds and I lost it. Not knowing what this thing was going to do next, I took off running to the middle of the bridge and spun around. Every hair on my body was standing up. It did not follow me. I was not surprised. But I was also very happy. I was panting. Mostly from adrenaline, I think! I hustled back to camp and told Dave what happened. I said \u0093Let\u0092s go back over there. \u0093Grab your camera\u0094 (a digital with a strong flash and video+audio). I was very excited. I knew that this could be a chance of a lifetime to get this thing on film. You have to understand that in my mind, there was nothing else that this creature could be than a REAL Sasquatch. I completely believe it to this day. Anyways, Dave Cannot find his camera. After we looked for a couple of minutes or so I get pissed and said, or words to the effect \u0093Let\u0092s go while this thing is still in the same county\u0094! So we get to the bridge and walk fast at first, then slow way down being quiet. I whispered \u0093 You watch the left side and I\u0092ll watch this side. We\u0092ll try to get both flashlights on it at the same time\u0094. Dave\u0092s flashlight was about the same as mine). It wasn\u0092t in front of the gate anymore. That didn\u0092t surprise me. What I did see was the red reflector. I did not even know it was even there the 1st time. But there it was. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb! It was blocked by the Bigfoot.On Dave\u0092s side was a pull-out. It was empty. (The next night some people \u0091Camped\u0092 there). I told Dave \u0093Shine your light up the road\u0094. There HE was! On my side walking slowly towards us. He had the exact same eyes. The left one was messed up, just like the 1st time! Dave and I were about 10-12 feet apart. I said \u0093Dave, THERE HE IS! Do you see him? He\u0092s coming Dave! There he is!\u0094. Both of our lights had shined on this things face at the same time. Only for like 3 seconds or so. But it lit his head up!  The head did not look pointed to me, like many people have reported. It was really BIG though. I was slowly backing up as I watched it walking towards us. \u0093Don\u0092t you see it ?\u0094 \u0093No\u0094 he says. I was backing up slowly out of fear as I\u0092m watching the eyes move up and down rhythmically.",
