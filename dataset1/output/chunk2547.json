While he wasn't quick to say it was a 'Bigfoot' he did think that that activity was unusual, especially since it had happened again to one of his associates a month later.  All of the activity they both experienced was in the early morning hours, around 3 or 4 am.I asked if he heard any sound such as breathing, or if he smelled anything unusual and he said no.  The 'subject' just walked, through the leaf litter of the forest, off the trail with no hesitation. I asked if it could have just been a deer or other animal and he said no, it was something on two legs for certain. ",
