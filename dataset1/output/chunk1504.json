            "Follow-Up Report": "John, a surveyor from Bakersfield, took Matt Moneymaker, BFRO Curator Richard Hucklebridge and me to the site which is located a few miles from Frazier Park (directions to site edited).  When we reached the exact location John reenacted the encounter, showing us how the bigfoot appeared to be caught by surprise when John crested a hill and suddenly came into its view.  The bigfoot appeared to panic and, after a few false starts, ran on two legs across the dirt road from left to right and into some trees.  Examining the area, we were amazed at the amount of pig tracks and spoor we saw.  At one point we spotted a wild pig running away from our vehicles.The site is located in the Tehachapi Mountains \u0096 a southern connection between the Sierra Nevadas and the Coast Ranges.  This connection allows these animals to move inconspicuously from one range to another, without having to traverse California\u0092s central San Joaquin Valley.  There have been several sightings in this general area, some dating back many years.Here are Richard Hucklebridge's observations and photos:I was one of the other investigators who was asked if I would like to attend this investigation with the witness and the witness\u0092s wife who took us up and into this remote site. One of the reasons that I was asked is the fact that I only live about forty miles east of this location in the Antelope Valley and have reported on several other sightings in and around this location. Please note that I was not the primary investigator on this report. I only got to hear what the witness said on the trip in and the trip out. I mainly interviewed the witness\u0092s wife who stated that she usually made these remote trips with her husband, but on this day, she had family business at home, and so she missed the sighting and was kind of glad, but at the same time kind of sad that she missed seeing this creature.The witness was in his SUV 4x4 driving very slowly on a dirt road northwest towards this ridge line, and the witness was about 75 yards or so from this creature when he first spotted it; and his first thoughts were that it was a bear, because he really never believed in any such creature as a sasquatch,  so when this thing turned and began running from him in a northeasterly direction, on two legs really fast; at that moment he realized that it was not a bear, but a very large creature that had hair all over its body, moving like a human, but it wasn\u0092t, so it just had to be one of those legendary creatures that was not real in his mind, yet!  This shook this very large witness to the bone, which had never happened to him before.The witness watched it move for about 12 or so seconds running, which in sasquatch time is a fairly long time to watch this creature. This creature was probably looking for something to eat like a wild hog a very short distance from this ridge line. Now just over this ridge line and about 2 or so miles down into the canyon below on the other side was highway 5, which has numerous 18 wheelers and other vehicles traveling up and down that highway at all hours. The vehicle noise that was emanating up from that canyon was almost deafening at that top of that ridge line where the creature was first spotted. In my opinion that is why the creature was probably unaware of what was approaching him, and why the witness got so close in the first place, plus the creature was not quite sure on what direction it had to take to get out of harm's way.I attempted to follow in the direction of where the witness said he first sighted this creature; hoping to locate some tracks and/or impressions in the ground, but too much time had passed between the sightings and our investigation. I believe that time was about two to three weeks.  Over a slight rise and out of sight of the witness, I located a dead bush/tree which at one time was about 8 ft. tall, but my first impression of it was the fact that something large had run through it, because it looked like it had just exploded.  I did spend a little time looking for hair, with no luck. The direction this creature took was probably the fastest way for it to get away from the witness.We all observed several deer and one wild hog while we were leaving that area. What I do remember about the hog was that it was black, looked like it weighed about 250 to 300 lbs. and this critter seemed to be all head and mouth as it moved really fast away from our vehicle. I did attempt to get a photo of it but it came out blurred.  Enclosed are a few photos that I took while at the location. Two photos are remnants of where hogs were on that ridge line, scat and a rutting area, and which I believe was going to have been dinner for this creature on that fateful day. The other photo is approximately where the creature was first spotted.",

I live in western Washington but grew up in Walla Walla and love the Blue Mountains. I\u0092m an avid hiker and love to enjoy the outdoors. When I get the time I like to make a hiking trip. I hadn\u0092t been to this particular site before but I had heard some of the Sasquatch stories coming out of the Tiger Canyon area. I had driven up Tiger Canyon a couple times before, including a few weeks prior in late June when the road was still blocked by snow. I thought this campground would be the perfect place to stay the night and hike the area. A friend of mine had been with on the trip when the road was blocked, but he too was busy this week so I went alone to scout out the area alone, stay the night and drive back to western Washington the next day.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This report was received in early August 2008, but due to the Georgia Bigfoot debacle; the report was put aside, because of how this witness felt about how people might view him and his story; which had just taken place up in the Blue Mountains of the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness area of Oregon.On the 10 of February of 2009 J.S. e-mailed me stating that he has decided that he would like to go ahead and tell his story which has caused him much concern after his short camping and field trip. I called J.S. as he requested. This young man, who is working in the computer world, seemed very credible in the retelling of his encounter last summer up in the Blue Mountains of Oregon; which is located just below the Washington and Oregon border. I never asked this witness for his GPS coordinates, because we will be giving the readers a small enough GPS location box that has all of the above-mentioned named places included.As of this date, this was the first and last possible encounter that this witness has had; which at first, he refused to accept as it was happening to him during his outing. After viewing all of those footprints that were close to where he had set up his camp; which by the way he didn't think were real at first. Not until he was on his short field trip into on the wilderness trail, about 3 miles out of camp, when he came up on what was an indisputable fresh print. He remembered that he had left his camera's memory card back in his car and was unable to take a photo.After rethinking his encounter, J.S. now believes that the sounds he was hearing and feeling were being made in the back of a throat of something that had to be very large, but as he looked around, he could never locate anything that was making those on and off growling sounds.  After the two other campers left the area, and adding up all that was taking place, like the rhythm knocks and the throwing of small rocks that had landed just behind him, and the footprints that were seen; he finally made the decision to leave that camping spot and head for town to try and shake those fearful feelings that were still with him.This writer believes that this witness was in the presence of several of those Sasquatch creatures, and at first J.S. refused to believe that it was happening to him. First, the one that was throwing rocks behind him, and second when it was making those knocking sounds mocking the rhythmic thumps like J.S. was making when he was pounding in those tent stakes; I believe those were more than likely being accomplished by juvenile Sasquatch's that were probably playing with him. Note he had viewed many different sizes of tracks around his camping area, but they didn't look too fresh or real at the time.The Paul Freeman footage was filmed in this Blue Mountains region near the Washington/Oregon border. The area of this report was one of Mr. Freeman's favorite places, and is real close to where he got his short film. I now believe this footage to be of a real Sasquatch, after I had the chance to view his complete film. Mr. Freeman died in 2003. I am familiar with the area, back in 2000 I had the chance to camp at Deduct Springs, which is located on Tiger Canyon Road, a short distance down from Squaw Springs. We are enclosing two photos that were taken by this witness around his camping area, but this writer cannot say for sure that it is a Sasquatch track, but has some possibilities of being one. Let's face it photos of tracks are difficult to discern.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hey Richard, just wanted to send you these for the report. I attached to this email the pictures I took on the day of the encounter shortly after I got back to camp. Its somewhat easier to see if you rotate the picture to where the toes are pointing up. I wish I had gotten some casts and a picture of that print that was a lot more clear! (left my memory card in the car!) This track looked a little older (less fresh) and was closer to camp.J.S.P.S. The pictures are all of one print with and without flash and I put my foot up for size comparison - I wear a size 11 shoe. ",
