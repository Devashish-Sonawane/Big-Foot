            "Observed": "We live about a mile from Austin Bridge Road in Paulding County, Georgia.  We believe we may have seen whatever it is was seen in your Report # 14887.   We were going to drive out to Hiram for dinner in our Suburban;  and were heading towards Ridge Road on Austin Bridge.  Near where Austin Bridge intersects Mein Mitchell Road; we saw what I would describe as an animal with the basic body structure of a bear but standing on it's hind legs;  and a face that seemed more wolfish than anything else.   It had to be about 9 feet tall.  It stood in the road.  At about 200 yards we decided to pull the vehicle around and go a different direction rather than drive any closer.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, who with his wife and children, witnessed the animal standing in the middle of Mein Mitchell Road near Austin Bridge Road.  The witness has a military background and is a trained observer. His account was very credible and rich in detail.The family was driving on Austin Bridge Rd traveling towards Ridge Rd.  The witness had intended to take Mein Mitchell Rd when the creature was encountered.  He then decided to change his route.The duration of the observation lasted for about two minutes. The animal was described as being about 9-10 feet tall, human-like, barrel-chested, lean and tall. The shoulders were described as being not very broad and there not being much of a neck. The hair color could not be discerned and was described as being \u0093dark,\u0094 with the length being about 3 to 4 inches long. The key feature that impressed the witness was the animal\u0092s facial features. The witness described the face as being very \u0093lupine\u0094 or \u0093wolfish\u0094---\u0093a wolf head with a small snout.\u0094 The witness stated that the eyes glowed red as if the illumination came from within the eyes rather than from reflection coming from the headlights of the vehicle.This sighting occurred very close in time and location as  BFRO Report 14887. There have been reports of animals being killed in the area coinciding with these sightings which may or may not be a coincidence.",

On her way back down she just happened to look out of the window and she saw this dark figure walking up the road. She couldn't see it that well because trees were blocking her view but the window was open so she heard it making deep grunting noises. All the dogs in the neighborhood were barking and crying.",
