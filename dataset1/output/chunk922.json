The creek was calm pools filled with trout that could be visually watched at place I camped. To be blunt I was an easy target and no threat to a large animal with night vision. I think my vulnerable state next to the game trail made for intrigue to the animal.",

            "Observed": "I went camping up Little Deer Creek on Forrest Rd 1820 in Finny Creek area Skagit Valley in 2006. The road ends at the bridge that crosses the creek. I hiked roughly two miles up the creek and camped on a gravel bar. The creek on the North side of me by 20 feet and the large forest of fir and cedar to my south by 75 feet. There was a small stand of alder between me and the forest where I had collected my firewood and materials for my lean-to and bench. Before sun down I caught about seven cutthroat trout out of the pool next to my camp and pan fried them. Shortly after sunset I began to hear what I would describe as an axe handle being struck against a tree in the forest to my south. It would rap out three distinct strikes and then move through the forest and repeat striking at different trees. This went on about an hour and well into pitch black. The forest in that area is as rough as any in the Pacific Northwest and would be terribly dangerous for a man to attempt to navigate in the darkness. About 30 minutes after the end of the tree strikes, I had settled down and was just relaxing when a pine cone came bouncing through my campsite coming from the forest and stopping just short of the creek. The nearest Fir tree was 75 feet from me. At this point I cracked my Scotch and proceeded to calm my nerves. The Next morning I gathered my gear and exited the area.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed \"Jerry\" over the phone on May 10th, 2018.  He currently lives in Idaho but resided in Sedro Woolley, WA. at the time of this experience.I am familiar with the location and have explored the area on several occasions.  HIs description of the creek and ruggedness of the terrain is quite accurate, although I believe he meant FS Road 1840 and not 1820.  His was the only vehicle parked at the end of the road when he headed upstream to his camping spot.I believe him to be a knowledgeable outdoorsman and a credible person.",
