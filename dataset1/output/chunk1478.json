After coming around the last turn before the road turns to Miller Bay Road I saw something I will never forget. It looked as though a tall dark man was standing behind a tree. My headlights shined right at it and it seemed to try to pull its body behind the tree. It sent shivers up my back! I have had dreams about it ever since that night and I still have no idea what I saw.",

His lights hit the individual for only a brief second as they were driving yet it made him question who this \"guy\" was standing behind a tree on a hill next to the road. What caught his eye was the way the lights \"reflected\" off the subjects eyes as a white color.",
