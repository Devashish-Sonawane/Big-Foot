            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed RS by phone on December 2, 2011, for approximately one and a half hours. RS indicates that he and two friends were camping in the Pisgah National Forest at the Black Mountain Campground on August 20-21, 2011. RS describes their camp site as being remote from a cluster of other occupied campsites, separated by an estimated 100 feet from other campers and up towards a ridge. Terrain was composed of rolling hills, average tree growth, ferns, poison ivy and a nearby stream near a ravine. Deer were observed previously in the park by the group, although none were viewed near the sighting area. During the evening of August 20, RS indicates that while he and friends were engaged in typical campfire activities, they all heard numerous unidentified animal-type vocalizations during the evening. The sounds started low in volume and tone and ended in a higher/louder character, described by RS as sounding \u0093angry.\u0094 Later, RS states that one of his companions observed a large figure moving through the woods, close to the campground, via the ambient light of the fire. RS was asleep during this event and does not recall any details. RS states that on August 21, 2011, his two companions left to hike to Mt. Mitchell. The weather was sunny, sky clear and temperature was around eighty degrees. RS was unable to complete this hike with his friends and decided to stay at the camp. At approximately 2:00 PM, he decided to take a short walk alone, on a trail close to camp. RS proceeded approximately two hundred yards from his site and suddenly observed a large, 7\u0092-8\u0092 bipedal animal walking from his right, proceeding across a clear area to the left across his path. RS describes the animal as weighing 300-500 pounds, possessing 3\u0092-4\u0092 wide shoulders (like an NBA player) covered in dark brown, scraggly and matted six inch long hair. The animal proceeded in a casual manner, employed an estimated eight foot stride and arms swayed slower than leg movement. The animal stopped, RS stopped and they stared at each other from a distance of 35\u0092-65\u0092 away. RS states that at this distance he was unable to determine any significant facial features, but the face was the same color as the hair. He relates that he was terrified and the experience scared him tremendously. During the 15-30 second stare, RS made the following observations. Head shape was described as semi-conical, but not distinctly pointed. No visible neck was observed. Arms were described as long, hairy, hands extended to its knees. RS did not look at or observe the feet. Legs were muscular. RS felt the animal exhibited a demeanor of indifference. The animal did not appear to be engaged in any specific activity except travel. The animal was the first to break the stare and resumed moving through the wooded area, away from RS. No associated animal tracks or impressions were found after the event. During this interview, I found RS to be a credible observer and witness. I feel it is highly probable that the animal RS observed on August 21, 2011 was a Bigfoot.  ",

            "Observed": "My friend and I were leaving my dad's old house, its in the middle of the woods so normally there are tons of birds and other animals making noise, but we noticed that everything had become completely silent. All of a sudden at the bottom of the gully we hear this crashing sound in the woods. We looked back to see what it was and there was this huge creature standing in the swamp. It was standing on two feet, covered with light brown, long hair. It was shaking the trees and after we watched it for a second it took off running through the woods. As soon as it ran, so did we...",

            "Follow-Up Report": "There were two witnesses in this sighting, both in their late teens; the author of the report, \u0093AK,\u0094 and her friend, \u0093L\u0094. The sighting occurred northwest of Lake Bemidji near Alice Lake. The witnesses were inside a house, which had been unoccupied for about a year, where AK grew up. Two other friends were also along but were on the opposite side of the house when the sighting occurred so they saw nothing.AK said the silence she \u0093heard\u0094 when she came out of the house was really striking. L didn\u0092t mention it. When I asked AK about it she explained that normally there were a lot of animal sounds from the swampy area below the house \u0096 frogs especially \u0096 and that had all gone quiet. Upon emerging from the house (the two had crawled in then out through a window) their attention was grabbed by a tree down along the swamp that was shaking. They saw a big, upright, hair covered animal standing there in the water. It ran and so did the witnesses.AK said she had seen \u0093lots of bears\u0094 growing up there and that she had never seen a bear stand as tall as this creature. And it ran off \u0093on two feet,\u0094 she said. Although it ran across an open area, neither witness watched it because they ran, too, just after \u0093it took off.\u0094 Neither witness could describe the animal in detail but both (AK interviewed by phone three times, L by e-mail only) described it in similar ways. L wrote, \u0093\u0085we heard twigs snapping in the swamp\u0085 when we turned to look, there was a creature that looked quite huge standing erect on two feet holding on to a tree and shaking it. I was so scared and the first thing that popped into my head was, \u0091Bigfoot is real!\u0092\u0094 L went on to say, \u0093I don\u0092t think it could have been a bear\u0085 because this creature didn\u0092t have a head shaped the same as a bear, it was more humanly shaped than a bear\u0092s head.\u0094Both witnesses mentioned the color, which was very light brown \u0096 the color of cardboard, is how AK described it. \u0093It had to be at least 7 feet tall, maybe 8 feet because it was standing in a foot of water,\u0094 AK said. And, \u0093it was thick,\u0094 she said when I asked her to give me a sense of the animal\u0092s bulk. AK also said she could see its legs as it ran off, and its arms, which it used to move brush out of the way as it took off running. When I asked how close the animal was to them, AK said she couldn\u0092t say, but when I asked if she could have thrown a rock and hit it, she said she thought so.Mike Quast assisted me in this investigation by inspecting the area where the sighting occurred on January 7, 2003. He described the swamp, or pond, as being a couple of hundred feet across and open, with trees around the bank but none out in the water. He also reported that there were large open pastures and fields\u0085 horses in the area, and horse tracks on the roads. And, there was a game trail along the side of the swamp with many animal tracks, including deer, but none that looked like sasquatch. \u0093I didn\u0092t expect to find any trace of an event from 2001,\u0094 he said. There were also several loud barking dogs in the area and one of them approached him. I asked AK about the dogs, whether they had been present at the time of the sighting. She said no, they didn\u0092t see any dogs then.My sense is that this sighting was real. AK, the witness I spoke with, came across as truthful and only interested in telling someone about what she and her friend had seen.Thanks to Mike Quast for his help in investigating this report.",
