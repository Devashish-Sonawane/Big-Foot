            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the reporting party (RP) extensively by telephone, and the following can be added:The RP is an avid fly fisherman who was vacationing in the area.  He lives in another state, and is not very familiar with this part of the country.  He was by himself fly fishing shortly after sunrise along a stream that feeds into Hawley Lake on the White Mountain Apache Reservation.  He had walked and fished along the stream for a mile or so from where he parked his vehicle, and there were no other people around.  Sometime around 7 AM he heard a very loud vocalization that he described in his initial report as a scream, but when questioned further he characterized it as more of a howl\u0085\u0085very long and so loud that he \u0093could feel it in his chest.\u0094  He said that although he had no idea what kind of animal could have made a noise like that, he did not feel frightened, and he continued to fish for another hour or so before leaving the area and heading back to his vehicle.  He heard no additional vocalizations, and he did not hear or experience anything else unusual.  I specifically asked about a \u0093feeling of being watched,\u0094 and he advised that he did not feel anything like that.  He said that he did not interpret the vocalization as being of an aggressive nature, and he did not feel threatened, which is why he did not feel the need to immediately leave the area.  He characterized it more like a call to \u0093let the world know that he (the creature) was there, and that this was his territory.\u0094  The RP described himself as a life-long outdoorsman, who is comfortable in the backcountry and is familiar with all of the commonly-found wild animals and the sounds they make.  He stated that he had never heard anything even remotely like this before or since, and he had often wondered what animal could have made a noise like that.  He advised that he had never told anyone about the incident, but after hearing similar vocalizations during a television program about Bigfoot, he realized that must have been what it was, and he thus decided to file his report.  He expressed surprise that someone from the BFRO would contact him, and appeared at first to be very nervous and hesitant to discuss the incident with me, saying that \u0093he didn\u0092t want anyone to think he was crazy.\u0094  After speaking with him for a little while on the phone, he relaxed a bit and willingly answered any questions I asked about the incident.  I found the RP to be well-spoken and credible, and I have no reason to believe that he is being anything but open and truthful about what he experienced.The White Mountains of eastern Arizona have a long history of Bigfoot/Sasquatch activity, dating back well over 100 years, with local Apache legends of the \u0093hairy man\u0094 going back centuries.  There are vast undeveloped areas on the White Mountain Apache Reservation and in the adjacent Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, much of which is high-elevation forest and prime habitat for a wide variety of wild animals.  For the local Apache residents on some parts of the reservation, Bigfoot sightings are not uncommon, and at one time there were footprint casts on display at the White Mountain Apache Tribal Police Headquarters in Whiteriver.  Hawley Lake itself is at an elevation of 8,200 feet, and sees recreational heavy use during the summer months, however it is inaccessible much of the winter due to heavy snowfall.  Although the RP, not being familiar with the area, could not tell me exactly where his incident occurred, the most significant stream feeding Hawley Lake is called, quite appropriately, Trout Creek.  From the RP\u0092s description, it is most likely that this is where the RP was at when he heard the vocalization.            ",

            "Observed": "I was driving on my way to school at 6:30am.  I'd just left my house and was only about 2 miles from home.  To my right was a large pig farm, and about a quarter mile ahead and on my left, was just a small farm.  I wasn't even driving the speed limit because the road was very icy.  I'd just come up to the driveway of the pig farm when I saw in my headlights what I initially thought to be a snowmobile pulling up out of the ditch right next to the mailbox.  It stopped and appeared that what I thought to be the operator of the snowmobile was standing and leaning down to reach the handlebars.  I instantly thought it was strange that they didn't have their headlights on.  At that moment, the figure bolted across the road.  The way I can describe it best is that it ran the way a young child would racing against friends.  The differences were, that the size made me believe that there was no way it was a child, it ran so fast and disappeared into the woods behind the house of the small farm and the amount of steps it took were so few that it couldn't have been any person that I knew.  I called my husband right away and asked about the owner of the home and if they were strange or different and if he would have any explanation as to why they would be out so early in the morning checking their mailbox.  I was trying to rationalize the situation.  He said that the owner of the property was \"normal\" as far as he  knew, but they had moved out months ago and nobody had been there since.  I wasn't able to make out too much detail as the sun hadn't quite come up over the horizon, but I could tell that it was tall and bulky with long arms and a very long stride.  This would explain why I thought the shadowed outline was a snowmobiler standing up and holding onto the handlebars.  An average person would appear taller, would look large in width because they most likely would have plenty of warm clothing and a helmet on and would appear to have longer arms down by their knees if they were reaching for the handlebars.  This residence is about 3 miles from the Roseau River and just a couple more miles from the wildlife refuge.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Priscilla regarding the early morning road crossing. She had left at 6:30 am to go to Grand Forks. It was a chilly, early spring morning and the roads were ice covered due to the melting snow and frost.  The sun was just starting to rise (sunrise was approximately7:06 am). There was some daylight, but mostly shadows still at that time of the morning. Heading south on Highway 3 she was driving slowly, maybe 40-45 mph, because of the icy conditions.  She was just a couple of minutes from her house and just passing a large farm, when she observed in her headlights what appeared to be a snowmobiler riding upright on the sled pausing in the west side ditch and with the lights off. The rider appeared to be wearing a very bulky suit and a large black helmet. Priscilla clearly remembers being perturbed that a snowmobiler without any lights on would cut her off. But, within a moment or so what she thought was a snowmobiler stood up in the ditch and ran upright on two legs across the road, covering the width of the highway and both shoulders in maybe five steps before it disappeared into woods near a mailbox of a farm where no one lived at the time.  \u0093It took the longest strides!\u0094 she said. Priscilla remembers thinking at the time, \u0093What the heck just happened? It looked just like someone crossing the road.\u0094 There was enough early morning sunlight and headlights to tell the creature was black. She immediately called her husband.  About a month later Priscilla talked with the property owner of the vacant farm. The owner confirmed that no one was living there at the time. He also told her that two years earlier his son had an experience at the house as well.\u0093It blew my mind,\u0094 Priscilla said. \u0093I used to laugh at Finding Bigfoot, but not anymore. There is no doubt in my mind what I saw.\u0094Roseau County, Minnesota, is located in far northwest Minnesota and borders Canada.  There are many parks in the county, including the 54,915 acre Lost River State Forest.",
