            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness saw a large, gray colored creature walking a tree line between two rows of apple trees.  He detailed the movement, stating \"It wasn't a man.  It was too big and it didn't walk like a man!\"  He described the body as thick and rounded, hunchbacked, two to three feet taller than a typical man (making the height around eight to nine feet tall).  He guessed the weight to be around 300 lbs or more.  The witness was about 200 yards away, so he was not able to give details about the hair or facial features.  He witnessed the creature walking through the orchard, heading toward a main highway that was just over the hill from where the witness was standing. Keep in mind that this man was a teenager at the time, although his story was consistent each time I asked a question from a different angle. This witness' integrity is important to him.  He wanted to be sure to share only what he saw and nothing more, nothing less as best as his memory serves him.The nearby highway noted is actually US Hwy. 31. The witness was a teenage migrant worker at an orchard at the time and he has not returned to Michigan since this incident occurred, although he would like to revisit the sighting area.  The witness stated that thirty years ago, there was a lot of wilderness area where he would ride his motorcycle.  He stated that sometimes he would ride the trails in the woods looking for wildlife, but he sometimes he felt as though he was being watched.  It gave him the creeps, so he would return back as soon as possible.  The witness also stated that the orchard business has moved and he is unclear exactly where the location was originally, but he gave me a general idea.  ",

It looked at me for a second. I saw its big red eyes, and I could see how big the thing is. I didn't see extreme detail, but it was gigantic. Within a second or two it was in the woods on the other side of the road.  What really made me think it was a Bigfoot, was by how fast it moved, and how high off the ground was its eyes.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "When interviewed on the phone witness recounted his observation in extreme detail, adding that the color of the animal observed was black. When asked what sounds he occasionally hears around his home, a small rural acreage, he allowed that he had heard what sounded like screaming.The area where this encounter occurred is a dense greenbelt along the upper reaches of the Iowa River. The Iowa is quite small here, but is mighty, having carved a deep canyon through the heart of what is now the town of Iowa Falls, which is just a few miles upstream from the encounter. There are numerous wildlife management areas, county parks and boat access parks for many miles along this stretch of the river. This green belt is quite extensive, with bedrock outcrops along the river. The Iowa, Cedar, Wapsipinicon, Yellow, Skunk and other small eastern Iowa rivers begin on the DesMoines Glacial Lobe, which occupies north-central Iowa. This area is geologically very young, with farms dominating the landscape. The DesMoines Lobe is drained extensively by the headwaters and upper reaches of the major rivers in eastern Iowa, all of which contain significant green belts along most of their length.I am familiar with the area of witness's encounter. Having spoken with witness I find him to be credible. This was a classic night time road crossing.",
