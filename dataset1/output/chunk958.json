            "Follow-Up Report": "This report was originally submitted to the Texas Bigfoot Research Center.The witness lives near the bridge on the above mentioned farm. She said that her father had told her that when he was a child, he and his father saw a bigfoot cross the river that goes under the above mentioned bridge while fishing.The family farm has livestock and a pecan orchard; there are still pecans on the ground from a year ago. Heavy woods with deer and other wildlife surround the farm, so there is adequate food supply for a large animal. The witness is not sure where the baby goat came from; she did not own any goats nor did the local neighbors. A further description of the sighting is as follows: While driving home the witness began to go over a bridge that crosses a river that is near her farm. On the opposite side of the bridge is a flashing red light, which added to her problem with seeing at night. This made it difficult for her to see what she first thought was a large dog in the lane ahead. She thought it was a dog because of its hair and color. As she slowed down and approached the animal, she immediately saw it was much larger than she first assumed. She moved over into the other lane to pass and slowed down to get a better look.The witness realized that what she was seeing was possibly on four legs, or stooping over with its hands on the ground. In this position its height was about five feet. The witness measured its height against the height of the nearby guard rail. I asked her about the bulk of the animal and she said it was bigger than her husband that weighs around 280 pounds. Whatever she saw seemed to \"freeze\" as though it didn't want to be seen and stood stock-still. At this time an overpowering odor hit her as she had the top down on her convertible. Finally she realized what she was seeing was something out of the ordinary, not a dog or cow, but something she had not seen before. She quickly accelerated and sped home and rushed into the house.Adding to this anecdote is the fact of the size, smell, and location; it is possible that the witness had an encounter with a bigfoot making a late night crossing of a rural bridge.
