Harley estimated the tracks to be 18-20 inches long and 9-10 inches wide, he also noticed a smaller set of tracks along with the other tracks.  Harley said the second set of tracks were about 10 inches long.  As he followed the tracks he came to a wooden bridge and lost the tracks there.  Harley did not report this sighting till 14 days later out of fear that he would be considered a nut.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I followed up on this sighting 14 days after it occurred.  The snow along the trail had melted off.  I crossed the wooden bridge and discovered that this side still had snow and ice on the ground.  While walking the area I did discover tracks along the dirt road heading towards the fields.  The tracks were frozen showing the out line of toes, these measured 10 inches with a two foot stride which matched Harley's report.  I also found a track which was frozen into the mud along wooden stairs.  I casted it but the heat from the casting material somewhat melted the frozen mud.  The cast does show 2 toe marks.  I also discovered what might be a possible sasquatch nest along the paved trail.  ",
