            "Observed": "I was 18 then just out of high school and was camping with friends behind my parents house in the Shawnee forest. I remember now that one of my friends said that he felt as though we were being watched and he was very uncomfortable and didn't leave the area of the fire much. We had heard something moving across the field from where we were camped and I wanted to see what it was. There were many small apple trees in this field and I went down and sat under one so I could see the other side of the field with out the glare of the fire. The moon was bright that night and afforded a fairly good look at what was going on. Along the tree line was a possible sasquatch walking slightly hunched over but looking toward the camp fire and the camp area in general. I remember his eyes flashing red as the fire would reflect in them. I refer to it as a him simply for the fact that I assumed that it was the same from the first sighting years before and had now evident breasts. It cleared the field in very short time and headed into a small ravine. We didn't hear it or see it again. This was in October of 1990.",

I thought at the time someone must be nuts to run through here in a costume in broad daylight because it is April Fools Day and didn't run like i would have if i were on my hands and feet. It ran like nothing I've ever seen. I looked up animals native to Missouri to make sure and nothing came close to the posture, color and speed of this creature.",
