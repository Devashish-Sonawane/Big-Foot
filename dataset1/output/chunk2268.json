            "Observed": "I was driving home through the mountains, from a concert last night, on Route 8 in Hamilton County, NY and at 12:37 a.m. I hit a \"creature\" that was carrying a deer, with my car. My car is damaged from the hood to the rear by this creature and I know it is at the least injured and its DNA may be on my car. The speed limit was 55 and I was not able to stop in time. When I saw the creature, who was carrying a deer, about to step into the roadway I hit the brakes but was only able to slow down minimally before impact. I did not really believe in Bigfoot before last night and I am still shaken up and have not been able to share this story with anyone. I wanted to stop and see if the creature was okay, but I was scared out of my wits to stop and get out of the car. The creature was huge, at least 7.5 feet tall. I've seen drawings and such of Bigfoot, and this creature looked similar, but had white around his hairline, and his fur was dark brown, almost black. I'm shaking writing this and I am in such disbelief that this happened to me. I can't even report the accident to the police, and I don't know what I will tell my insurance company. My car is totaled, the creature crushed my windshield wipers together, broke many pieces of the passenger side and left smears of dirt and blood all over the rear window.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness exactly one year after the incident.  The car, which may have contained hair, blood and tissue from the creature, was totaled by the insurance company and surrendered to them many months prior to our meeting. They were unable to locate any photos of the damage as they were sent to the insurance company as well. The witness stated that she attended the concert alone and did not consume alcohol. She and I attempted to locate the accident scene but were unsuccessful. On her way home she was able to identify the location and phoned me with directions.While heading north on Route 8 out of Wells with the thick, dense woods to the east and the Sacandaga River to the west, I arrived. According to the witness, the creature was running from the wood line to the east of Route 8 toward the river on the west side. It was carrying a deer that appeared to be deceased in its outstretched arms when it ran out into the road in front of the approaching car. The front corner on the passenger side of the car hit the creature and the creature slid down the side of the car causing damage down the whole length of the vehicle. It\u0092s unclear if the deer did most of the damage or the creature. We were unable to locate any physical evidence at the scene, it was very overgrown and between the snowplows in the winter and mowing in the summer it was no surprise.I believe the witness to be very truthful and it\u0092s very probable the incident occurred as described.  I\u0092ve spent most summers as a child and teenager living in Wells and know it very well. The area is perfect for a large creature to survive and there are many stories of encounters in Hamilton County and the Adirondacks as a whole.Its unfortunate that an Investigator was not able to get in contact with the witness sooner to retrieve DNA from the car and investigate the accident scene when it was fresh. Unfortunately the witness only supplied an email address when the report was submitted, prior emails reaching out to her may have been lost or misplaced. Its really hard to image any native New York animal that would be able to carry a deer in its arms while running, let alone a person in a suit.  The witness has never told anyone about the incident until now, telling the insurance company and her family that she had hit a deer.",
