So we asked them to stop but nobody responded we proceeded to head into shore when we noticed another big splash. So then we stopped and we noticed a foul smell, like a wet animal. We then looked towards the bushes and a tall thin tree was shaking very fast back and forth. Then we noticed a big bolder thrown through the air toward us, it hit the water. That's when we realized what the splashing was.Then we noticed a man like figure with red beady eyes when we flashed the light at the bushes about 2 feet above the bushes was the eyes. So we started to bang the boat with the oars to scare away whatever this was.Then we heard a loud scream as we loaded the boat on the truck and left.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness in great length and had gathered some additional information.According to the witness, he and a friend (who was unavailable to speak of the incident) headed towards shore after an evening of fishing on Lake Kawanuke.They were about 20 yards from shore when some unusual splashing was observed on the shoreline northeast of their position. This abnormal disturbance made them feel uneasy so they hollered at the would be pranksters to discontinue their actions. Without acknowledgement from shore, they proceeded cautiously  toward the boat launch when another loud splash was observed. Almost simultaneously, they smelled a strong, musky, wet animal odor that was unfamiliar.Suddenly on shore, a mid-sized sapling positioned in the center of 5-6 foot tall reeds, began to shake violently back and forth. They then observed a large rock ascend from shore and splash down near their boat.Upon shining the flashlight toward the commotion, they observed a  large, dark human shaped creature with slightly glowing red eyes spaced about 3-4 inches apart. (More specific details of the creatures\u0092 description were not observed as it was obscured by the reeds and other brush). They yelled and banged the oars against the boat in hopes of scaring it away. The creature moved to the right and back to where they could no longer see it. Immediately they repositioned the boat to approximately 40 yards from shore to observe from a safer distance.The boat launch was within 20 yards from the commotion, so they felt it would be safest to wait until they no longer felt threatened. The witness said at this point he was very frightened and crouched down in the 3 seat aluminum boat. He began to sweat and felt his hair rise. He described it as \u0093the worst goose-bumps\u0094 he ever had. Several rocks were thrown in all and when it stopped, they waited about a half hour before coming ashore. After loading the boat, a loud \u0093roar\u0094 was heard from about 300 yards away. He compared it to a vocalization he had heard on the TV program \"MonsterQuest\". He said he didn\u0092t go out after dark for nearly 2 months after the incident. He described it as being \u0093the most serious thing that had ever happened to me!\u0094. A house guest observing the witness while speaking with me, stated the witness was shaking. He became emotional at the end of our conversation as he thanked me for hearing his story and offering him some reassurance, as he has received some ridicule about his ordeal. He fishes Lake Kanawauke every other week but will not go there after dark. I feel the witness was being truthful while sincerely recounting his experience.",
