But here lately we can't ignore the activity going on. About a month or 2 ago my husband went outside to smoke he heard something and as he looked in our drive way he seen an animal that stood about 7 feet tall all hairy he couldn't explain it except that it looked like one of our dogs on 2 feet and extremely tall. It walked passed our trailer and that's how he could guess the hight could be. We've heard what sound like a baseball bat hitting a tree. We've heard whistles and calls of what a bigfoot sounds like. We've had chickens and cats go missing. Every night about the same time you can hear footsteps and sounds. It's to the point where we are scared to go outside. We've never believed in bigfoot till we seen it and have heard them I'm sure there are more than one around here cause we live near caves they sound like they are all around us at night.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken to the witness at length and found him to be credible and sincere in what he observed. When he described what he saw as looking like one of his dogs on two feet, he was referring strictly to the length and color of the creature's hair and not physical features. He described the creature as 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall, covered with dark brown hair that was about three inches in length and very muscular. He observed the creature walk down the driveway and continue behind his trailer where he lost sight of it. The witness observed a profile view of the creature walking left to right at a distance of 75 to 100 feet. The sighting lasted less than 10 seconds and the witness was able to provide the additional details. He stated the creature had a flat human-like face with no noticeable snout. He also stated the creature had long swinging arms and walked just like a man.I have had the privilege of visiting the property on several different occasions and have gotten a chance to spend quite a bit of time with the family. Despite the creatures bold and sometimes harassing behavior, they have been very open and forthright about the ongoing activity and have welcomed on-site investigations. ",
