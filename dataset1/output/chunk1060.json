            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted one of the witnesses on September 5th 2007. We made arrangements to meet at the location of the sighting. The witnesses are two couples that get together periodically to shoot clay pigeons. They found a road that came to a dead end which was perfect for their target shooting. I followed them to the dead end road. While they got their shooting gear ready I had a witness direct me to the location where they saw the dark object they assumed was a funny looking stump. It was about seventy five feet off the road and some what obscured. I had a bright hunters orange baseball cap that I held over eight feet high before I was told that was the proper height of the object. I looked around and there was nothing that could be misplaced as a stump. The forest was possibly third growth forest with trees maybe thirty feet high. The trees in the vicinity were no more than 18 inches in diameter. I determined at the time of the sighting the (creature, stump) would have been back lighted providing little if any ability to see frontal details. I looked at the area for possible foot prints and curiously found the location I was told to stand had been previously mashed down. The debris of the forest floor had been pressed into the ground by something substantial.  I also noted a lot of elk sign. They had recently traveled through and had tore up the ground significantly. There was a meadow about a one hundred feet to the North. Numerous trails seemed to intersect and lead into the meadow from where I was standing.In late August one of the couples had come down to the area to do some Trap shooting. The other couple was not present. They had set up the equipment and had shot a couple of rounds when a large alder tree came crashing down at the end of the road about three hundred feet away. They got extremely nervous and decided to pack up and leave the area. I did find what could have been the alder tree in question. It showed evidence of buckshot in the tree. It was to far away to have been connected to the trap shooting. There were a lot of shell casings on the road near the fallen tree. I suspect the tree damage had been done by others. Upon inspection the tree was not completely shot through and  I suspect was still standing before it was pushed over. I do believe it was pushed over and it had been pulled back from where it fell. As I was surveying this location my eye was drawn to an animal trail that lead from the river to the embankment near the fallen tree. The trail lead into the woods and parallel to the river. I looked up and about six and a half feet off the ground over the trail, limbs of a young fir tree were woven with alder sticks. The top of the tree had been broken off. It was upside down, and curiously woven into the limbs of the fir tree. I looked around finding further evidence. A two foot alder stick had been jammed and woven between three branches of another tree. Then something else caught my eye. Not more that fifteen feet away was a bright orange plastic utility marker in the ground. The witnesses provided me with two drawings of the Stump that vanished. What I find interesting is that there are two different interpretations showing that there wasn't any collaboration. They drew what they saw. One of the drawings shows what clearly seem to be legs. Questioning the witnesses about that I was able to determine that one witness had a full frontal of a back lighted subject  while the other person was looking at an angle. This means that one should have been able to see legs while the other probably couldn't.I find the witnesses searching for answers and reported what they what they saw. The area is conducive to good habitat with an elk population that is active here. The location is in the foot hills of the cascades at the base of Mt Rainier where numerous reports have originated.Our witness supplied these two drawings",

            "Observed": "Since my sighting up on Pilchuck on August 15th I had been telling people about it, especially my group of church friends. We had been talking about going up since the snow melted and we could get back up to the site. Anyway Friday July 5th we finally got the chance to go up. There was \"J.H,\" \"J. McK\", \"C.C. Jr\", \"G.C.\", \"J. Mc\", and myself, \"R.S\". \"J\" brought his Night Vision Goggles. None of them had a vehicle that could actually get to the site as I had before so we parked off the main  road and decided to hike up the road and see how far we could get. So we eventually got to about a quarter up the road and my legs started hurting, I am a bit over weight so I had to stop and rest because the group was so excited and intrigued by what we may find/ see that they wanted to get to where I saw my huge sighting last summer. So after being stopped for about 5 minutes I suggested to \"J\", who had brought a wooden broom handle, to do 6 tree knocks because there were 6 of us there. So we waited silently for about 2-3 minutes and we got a low sound of one knock from what sounded like 20 or so feet off the right hand side of the road, if we would not have been quiet we would have missed it. Then we all turned to focus on that side of the road and saw 2 sets of eye shine, one a silver bluish color and the other orange. The orange one's eyes where almost on top of each other as if it was leaning up against the tree or something or turned its head in a question like manner. Then the group decided I should try to call out to them so I decided to try some whoops. I turned my back toward them just in case they could actually see me so I could make it sound as if it came from the opposite side of the road and let out a series of about 6-8 whoops each last about 5-10 seconds in length of variant volumes then ended with a loud one that lasted about 8 seconds. After about 15 seconds or so we heard a low grumble type sound, not quite a growl but very guttural. Then a short (about 4-6 second) low whoop. By now it was about 30 minutes of us staying at this site and \"J\" and I started to get very scared of something on the road ahead of us not sure how far up the road. Eventually we started to see a very bright pair of the silver bluish eye shine up in the trees moving around, we though it was a young one. All this time the 2 off to the right side of the road were still there. There is a shallow slope on that side of the road that was some where between 3-4 feet to the height of the road then they came to about our eye height so I am guessing that they were somewhere between 7 and 8 feet tall. After 45 minutes we decided to turn back to the quarry/ gravel pit. When we were almost there we heard a low moaning sound that they do, come from the left side of the road which in this area is a hill and goes up from the road about 15- 20 feet. So we stopped and they asked me to try to imitate that sound. I tried my best but it sounded to much like a moo. Anyway I then asked \"J\" to do another round of tree knocks. No response this time so we carried on back to the quarry area. I then heard some rustling in the grass from within this open area, I asked for the NVGs and as I searched the area I saw one walking in the grass. Once it noticed that we had seen it it hunkered down and moved back into the grass. I passed the NVGs to \"J\" who had been the most skeptical about the whole thing and wanted to see what I was seeing. Eventually it got passed around so everyone could see it. \"J\" wanted to push forward and surround it and possibly catch it. I opposed that idea but said lets move in slowly so we could hopefully get a better view of it in the NVGs so we got some where around 10-7 feet from it before we had a rock thrown off to the side of us, I asked for the goggles and when I saw it, it was giving the motion that it wanted us to back off. So we slowly made our way back to the car. The one we saw in the quarry area was about 6-7 feet.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have been in contact with this gentlemen since his first report,  #36318 in 2012, and have made many visits to this location in the interim.  After my initial contact with \"R.S.\" regarding this report, it took several months for him to be able to gather the same group of friends/witnesses at the location for interview purposes.  Our meeting occurred on October 19th, 2013.  Unfortunately, the person who owned the night-vision goggles was unable to attend or send the goggles for attempts at recreating the sighting.  Nonetheless, the other three witnesses were able to relate the story with minor discrepancies or differences of opinion, mostly around who heard what, first.  The sighting happened in an old rock quarry that is now commonly used for target-shooting, which is surrounded by forest and bordered on the north side by an unimproved (rough) graveled road that bends around to WSW.  At the time of the sighting, R.S. had the NV goggles and was scanning the quarry.  At roughly 30 feet from him, he saw a human shaped figure starting to rise up from a squatting position from behind a small rock outcropping.  The figure was facing R.S. and apparently realized it could be seen.  When R.S. passed the goggles to \"J\", he saw the figure now in a crouching posture.  R.S. demonstrated the motions and positioning for me.The figure was described as human-like but with greater bulk and 6' or slightly more in height.  All of the group was present and accounted for, ruling out one of them playing a prank.Because the access road bends around to the WSW, you soon lose sight of the quarry and within 100 yards up this road, there was a visible path of trodden bush heading diagonally from the road and ENE back to the quarry perimeter where the figure was observed.Although this group never saw another vehicle or encountered any other people that night, I can't rule-out that some person may have used that path to approach unobserved.  I would consider it odd that if the \"visitor\" was a person, that they didn't make any effort at verbal communication with the group.As to the eye-shine mentioned in this report and also in Report 36318, I have found an explanation for most, but not all of it.  On only one of my many night forays to this location, my son and I encountered many pairs of blue-white eye-shine.  Changing positions and moving toward the lights indicated that when atmospheric conditions are just right, the lights of Seattle and Everett shine through the trees giving that very odd resemblance to eye-shine.  I believe that he witnesses have accurately described what they heard and saw and that they've been very fortunate to have been interacted with on two occasions now, by unknown visitors.",
