            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the reporting witness just a few weeks after the event. She was clear, succinct and sharp as a tack. As she stated, she was heading north towards town to get supplies for the week. Usually goes on Mondays like clockwork. The northbound lane was on the right and the southbound side was to her left. She saw movement up ahead on the left and she slowed down. The creature was physically described as : 9-10 feet tall with reddish brown hair. She indicated the shoulders were \"3.5 feet wide\" and as we spoke she indicated it was at least as wide as two grown men standing next to each other, so somewhere in that measurement range. She indicated that it's \"arms hung down to at or below the knees\". When she first saw it the \"hands were near the waist and when she passed it the arms were fully extended down by it's side.\" The eyes \"were deep, deep brown and huge\". She did smell the musty animal smell reported by many witnesses.She said they locked eyes and its head followed her as she passed it. The duration of the eye to eye contact was around 5 seconds and the duration of the entire event was in the 30 second range. She was no further from the creature than 12-15 feet. She had slowed to a crawl and had an unobstructed view.She had no fear, nor did the creature. They just stared at each other until she passed. In her rear view mirror she saw it clear the entire 2 lane hwy. in 2 steps and disappeared into the woods.She estimated a 6 ft stride.She felt no fear at all and the creature was not menacing or making any overt threatening movements towards her. As she mentioned, it seemed \"friendly\" and she had the sensation she could have reached out and touched it if she wanted. It waited for her to cross the road and then vanished in a \"couple of seconds\". Her area butts up to the Mark Twin National Forest and reports are plentiful there. Good solid witness and she felt privileged to have had the experience.",

            "Observed": "While driving down the road about 10:30 pm I saw something standing on the left side of the road where the road curves to the right.  I threw my headlights on bright and turned the wheel to the left and drove streight to it. I was sideways in  the road. As I neared it I stopped and I had a clear view of it.  It was so tall that I had to lean closer to the steering wheel to look up into its face.  I could see him (clearly a male) from just above his knees to the top of his head.  I looked streight into his eyes.  He seemed to be comunicating with me though his eyes.  He let me get a good look at him and then he gave a nod and I knew I was to go. He was at least 7ft tall or more with silver and black hair some of it at least 4 to 5 inches long and dark outdoors type skin (where it was exposed. His eyes resembled that of a dogs and were the color of a alaskain husky and wide flat nose and a wide thin mouth like a mans. He never opend his mouth. Just stood there and looked at me and blinked some and make jesters with his head and eyes. When he knodded at me I knew it was time to leave so I turned the steering wheel very slowly ( I felt dazed) and drove on down the road.  I estimated the time I set there about 15 to 20 mnutes.  I went home about 1/4 miles up the road.Then I trembled  was so excited I could hardly walk.  I never was afraid.",
