            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken with the witness on several occasions regarding this report as he saw it for a longer time than most people and I had many questions. I found him to be a very credible witness with quick answers to my questions and all the facts are the same when I re-questioned him on some points. Since neither of us can draw pictures, I showed him a picture from the website, and asked him for a comparison: \"Only the size and height are correct. The hands were different, more like ours, only the thumb was set back further on the hand. It had finger nails, NOT claws. Yellowish in color. The hair was lighter, more of a reddish brown. The eyes had no white. They were solid dark brown. It was a female. It had breasts, only the nipple area was hairless. The feet had five toes, set wide apart with long toe nails, also yellowish. It walked away with a stoop shouldered gait when it walked off. Its arms and legs were much larger, bulkier. Its hair was shorter, about 3 inches long, just enough to flap when it moved. It had no waist line, waist was same large bulk as upper body. It had flat teeth like a human, NO FANGS. Face was human looking, it showed expression while looking at me. All the other views were to the animals side except I had back view before it disappeared walking off.It was a female. It had breasts, only the nipple area was hairless. The hair on its breasts was much shorter and thinner that rest of body. Comparing breasts to those depicted in the Patterson film: they were not that large, they did not swing when it moved. Its hair was shorter, about 3 inches long, just enough to flap when it moved. There were a few leaves, twigs and debris tangled in the hair as if it had rolled or slept on the ground.Its large size combined with its incredible speed made it frightening. It made no sound while stalking the hogs. There was no odor. The woods had normal noise while it was stalking hogs. Squirrels were feeding, paying no attention to hogs or animal. Birds, frogs, crickets, everything making normal noises. After attack scream, all woods noise ceased, no sound of any kind except from animal and its answering call. Most of the time it would use its hands to steady itself when looking around tree. Hogs were all small, in the 100 to 125 pound range. It carried the hog under its arm much as a person would carry a sack of potatoes. When it crouched down on all fours, it curled its fingers and had its knuckles on the ground.\"Additional investigator comments, 1 May 2004:The site was located while motor boating to his normal hunting area. The witness noticed sign of hogs rooting along river's edge and stopped to check it out. The witness decided it was a better place to try, scouted the area, decided on stand locations and returned the next morning to set up and hunt.Tree stand height was about twenty five feet. Witness was wearing camo plus a mesquito head net.Length of encounter is an estimate of twenty minutes. It was not timed. Bear in mind that the witness's adrenalin was up, his fear factor was up and in such cases time sometimes does get compressed.The attack leaps: distance was about thirty yards. Fifteen yards per leap. This was on all fours.The movement from tree to tree: all tree to tree movements were two legged jumps, landing on two feet, anywhere from five to ten feet. Each movement going closer to the feeding hogs. Each movement animal was holding its body very still, slowing moving sideways just enough to look around the tree. All those movements, and landings were totally silent.The witness said the first set of whoops were similar to Sierra Sounds but not quite the same, and was really not able to explain the difference. The second set of whoops had a garbled sound at the end of each whoop, there was no garbled sound.  The third set of whoops was way different.  Bear in mind that this happened just seconds after the unexpected quick kill of the hog.  The witness was very unnerved at that time.Footprints and evidence: After finding hunting partner, they returned together to site to retrieve tree stand and found disturbed ground where it leaped both times and disturbed ground at the kill site plus a small amount of blood that apparently came from hogs mouth. Ground was covered in normal damp leaves and such, there were no footprints.  ",
