            "Also Noticed": "The creature was very quiet, light on his/her feet.  It was not as large as Bigfoot, and the fur was pure white like a Polar Bear. I didn't get a clear vision of its face. This was not a Polar Bear.  We lived in Colorado where there were only black bears. In addition the creature was obviously clever and had a sense of humor and intelligence that was human like. Again, it was not incredibly tall, maybe 5'9\" or so.  It wasn't a person playing a prank either, it was too agile and too fast, and that area is wilderness area, very difficult for a human to scammer around so quickly - over boulders and up mountains, etc.",

            "Observed": "It was in 1978... My former husband and I had taken our children for a picnic at Wellington Lake, just south of Buffalo Creek, Colorado.  What I saw was not the same as what I've seen in photos, however, what I saw was a bipedal creature with white fur.  This may sound strange, but, I was talking with my former husband when the creature stepped out from behind a boulder.  I told my now exhusband, to look.  He turned around but the creature ducked back behind the boulder.  My exhusband turned back to me and said, \"I didn't see anything.\" At that very moment the creature showed itself to me again.  I told my ex to turn around.  He did, and the creature ducked behind the boulder again.  This happened four or five times, and then the creature was gone.  The creature was partially bipedal and then would stoop like an ape and touch the ground. It had a human-like feeling about it because it was obviously playing some sort of a game with me.  I have never told anybody except for people I trust not to make fun of me.  I was a resident in the area for many years and I knew what wildlife was there...nothing came close to this creature.  I've seen mountain lion, bobcats, linx, badgers, deer, elk, bear, and many more creatures in that area, but nothing like this.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Excerpts from phone interview with witness who chooses to remain anonymous: Witness was talking with ex-husband when the creature suddenly appeared from behind a boulder approximately 60 feet away. Her first impression was that she was looking at a polar bear but immediately realized it was not a bear. It was completely covered in white semi-curly hair that looked about two to three inches in length over  its entire body. She described a stocky build, thick in the legs, chest and arms and narrow at the waist. It  appeared to be five and a half feet tall but never stood completely erect.  It had a flat hairy face and an ape like appearance but she could not make out any other details.  When it would emerge from behind the boulder it  would go from a quadrupedal position to a bipedal stance,  coming  out into the open. Then, as her husband would turn around to look it would quickly dive back behind the boulder. Witness was surprised at how swiftly and silently it moved.  She did not feel fear as she sensed it was acting in a very human manner, almost like a child would play peekaboo.  This happened about four to five times and then stopped.   After a few minutes she felt calm enough to investigate the area behind the boulder and found nothing, however, it was a heavily forested area. Witness is 53 years old,  a Professor, Adjunct Lecturer  holding two Master Degrees and is currently residing in the State of California. ",
