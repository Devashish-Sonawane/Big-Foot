He set up to call elk under the power lines just in the brush from the open field area and I proceeded up the road as it enters the forest to set up at a creek area the road crossed.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness and he described himself as a high school teacher and avid bow hunter with a lot of experience in the woods.  He wanted to get in a hunt during the last bow season for elk, so was checking food plots out by some power lines with a hunting partner.When he ventured alone close to a creek, he began to hear knocking and dismissed the sound to himself as campers driving tent stakes. As he listened further and the knocks increased in volume and intensity, he became puzzled - this was not someone pitching camp.When his partner let loose a cow call to lure bull elk, the knocking stopped. When the witness continued to walk the treeline, he could hear footfalls in the woods mirroring his movement. When he would stop, the movement would stop. When he walked, he would hear the movement in the woods continue. At this point it was getting dark and the witness began to suspect he was dealing with a bear. He began to walk toward the road hoping to get more in the clear because with the light situation, his range with the bow was about 25 feet.When in the road, the witness heard one last gigantic knock. He described this sound as threatening in its intensity.The witness was lucid and articulate throughout the interview, and his account seemed to be a true and accurate description of his experience during that evening.",
