He reiterated the details of the report. Although they have not had a visual sighting confirmation, many unusual things have happened. Elaborate stick structures, tree knocks, howls, whoops, intense odors, footprints, both large and small in a cornfield, 7' apart in stride, screams, and intense feelings of being watched were all related to me.His animals, both cats and dogs have been spooked repeatedly. The cats have hidden on the house rooftop. The dogs ran off scared.He had set up 2  cameras, but nothing unusual was picked up. He asked about leaving food out, which I discouraged, as he is disabled, and should not be creating a dependency situation with Bigfoots, if they are on his property.He said there are swamps, forest, and wetlands there also. He also shared some of these details with a forest ranger who came to the property too.",
