It was heavily timbered with a year-round creek in the back of the property and a mobile home. The location is about 8 miles northeast of Grants Pass, Oregon. The year I believe was fall of 1978. I moved up from southern California to Oregon and on the night of the visit I was home alone.  I had been sleeping and I am guessing it was maybe 2 a.m. when I was awakened by heavy, bi-pedal footsteps walking around my 12 x 60 ft mobile home. Pine needles littered the grass and seemed to amplify the heavy steps. I have hunted and fished all my life and have never felt anything like that night: the sensation and fear of what was outside my trailer stomping around.",

The area is more developed nowadays but its proximity to vast tracts of forestland in the Rogue River basin make it very plausible sasquatch country.  The witness is sufficiently experienced in outdoor pursuits that his account, while lacking in visual confirmation, does bear weight.  He is certain that something more unusual than a prowler or a bear was in the proximity of his residence.  ",
