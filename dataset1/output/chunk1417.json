            "Observed": "We backed pack into the Uintah's two years in a row - this was our second year. I have never shared my experience with anyone.  I was afraid people would think I'm crazy.  My personal experience happened about 1985-1986.  We were camping in the high Utah Uintah's (Grand-Daddy Basin) on the North edge of Betsy Lake, in a small clearing.  Since we were by the lake we built a little raft out of logs (tied them together).  The FIRST night something woke me (I was in a tent with my nephew).  It was about 2:00-3:00am I could feel and hear heavy walking outside the tent.  We had a two man tent and something was playing with the top of the tent (feeling the poles).  I lay in my sleeping bag (petrified!). Because we were so close to the water, I also heard someone (something) in the lake. What caught my attention the most was the long strides when they walked.  I knew it wasn't a bear, because bears would have clawed at the tents.  Whenever I camp, I always sleep in my clothes.  I finally got the courage to go out of the tent to look things over.  While I was putting on my shoes, my Nephew woke, and he said, \"What's that?!\"  I said, \"I don't know, but I'm going out to find out.\"  As I went out of the tent, I screamed as loud as I could (like Tarzan) to scare them away! The one in the lake came out and joined the other and they ran past the tents.  My sister heard them run past her tent and they ran fast!  They were gone immediately!",
