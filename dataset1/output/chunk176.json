            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with 72 year-old female witness via telephone. Witness states she was a passenger in the front seat of their large motor home with her husband driving, traveling about 40 mph. She looked to the left out thru the windshield and observed a tall black, bipedal creature walking a steady pace in an open field, height estimated at 9 ft. It was a 4-5 second brief observation. Witness described the creature as very large on two feet with long arms down by its sides.  Walking a smooth steady pace and heading in the same direction as her, North. At this location the Hoosic River runs along this route as well. There was a tree line it was heading towards.  The creature was about 150 yards away from their vehicle and she got a clear, brief look at it. The distance of 50 yards mentioned is the amount of distance the creature was from the edge of the highway. She compares what she observed to the subject in the Patterson-Gimlin film. A motorist reported a sighting not far from this location, see BFRO Report #46780. The other sighting on Route 7 that they refer to can be found on the Bigfoot Encounters website, and occurred in Vermont, see Man spots 'Bigfoot'.During the entire interview witness and husband were articulate, polite and constant with their replies.This investigator will follow up with a site visit as I am very familiar with the location and will update this report accordingly.

Both were on four-wheelers so he was able to get to his son quickly.In addition to the above statement, they reported that while listening to sound recordings outside on their laptop, vocals were heard.They played the Ohio Howl and their pets were non-responsive. As soon as the recording ended, they heard two distinct howls from the woods apparently in response to the recording. At that time both the cat and dog heard the live responses and became very agitated. Agitated to the point of scratching at the door to get in the camper. The grandmother said it sounded as if it was right outside.Also reported; 20 to 30 human-like tracks were found at a very wide gait and in a single row.I made an on-site investigation where some possible vocalizations occured. A handfull of varying sized prints were found as well.",
