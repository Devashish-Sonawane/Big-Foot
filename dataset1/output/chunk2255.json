Anyway my cousin wanted to go to his house for something so we got on our bikes to leave for his house which was about a mile and 1/2 away on an old backroad, we were on granger road and I was about half a mile  in front of him and he was screaming for me to wait for him, so as I was waiting for him I was on part of the road that was surrounded by the forest.  then I heard soemthing crashing through the woods, and out of the corner of my eye I saw something black almost a reddish colored thign run out of the woods take one step into the road and leap across the rest.  It landed on the otherside and then  hoped over a small fence surrounding someones property then it was  gone.  I was 12 then and I'm 18 now and about 6'2\"  but this thing was at least 2 feet taller than I am now, maybe even close to 9 feet but I'm not sure.  everyone I told laughed and said it was just a bear or something, nto many believed me, but I know a beer can't jump like that and around here they don't get that big.",

I came to a game trail and made my way north, back was facing the boundary, for a quarter mile to where there was a disused logging trail. I then started heading up the disused logging trail farther and farther up to the rim of Spearfish Canyon, maybe 2-3 miles.",

As he was going up a draw he saw something moving on the other side of it. He pulled up his sight on his rifle and saw a brownish hair covered bipedal  creature going strait up this draw like it was sprinting on flat ground. He was so afraid that he went straight home to his father what he saw. This sighting probably happened 10-15 years before mine. The father then told his son that he had had a similar experience at his age roughly 20 some years prior. I\u0092m unsure of the guys name and I\u0092ve been trying to figure out who spoke to my friends that night ever since.",
