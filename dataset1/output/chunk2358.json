Perhaps the first was the sense of curiosity upon experiencing something so unusual.  These location taps that were described to me occurred in a series of three at a time.  There was plenty of time in between for a third party to announce their presence but this did not occur.  The estimated distance of the closest wood knocking to the witness was approximately 200 yards.  The location of the building was near the top of the hill so the sounds were heard from below.  In his words, \"This was calculated and it unnerved me.\"Especially since the conditions were cold, approximately 2 A.M. and the topography of the woods were steep and rugged.It made no sense for someone to sneak in and bang trees at that temperature and in that forest.Another point mentioned was that the neighbor's dog constantly barks at all kinds of things.  But during this series of exchanges, it was strangely silent.  The approximate time this was listened to was about 20 minutes.It's worth mentioning that the correspondent has had nocturnal military training... so he was used to things that go \"bump\" in the night.
