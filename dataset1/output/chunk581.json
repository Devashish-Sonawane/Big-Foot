            "Observed": "Last weekend my girfriend and I went to join her family at Sugar Pine Point in El Dorado County next to Lake Tahoe for a camping trip. On the early morning hours of Saturday July 22nd I was awakened by a strange whoop/howl. I immediately woke my girlfriend up and asked her to listen with me. We were sleeping in a tent. The howl we heard was not close to us. It was at a distance but was very loud. My girlfriends' aunt and uncle were sleeping inside a camper trailer about 50 feet away from us and they said they heard it pretty clear. They have been camping there for years and we all agreed that it was something none of us have ever heard. The whoop/howl lasted 3-4 minutes with short intervals of rest. At one point during the whoop/howl, it almost sounded like there was two \"animals/things\" making this strange noise.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "When asked about how and why it sounded like two animals for a portion of the sequence of howls, the witness said that the sound seemed to be coming from two different directions for at least part of the time. The witness states that they have heard other large animals in the wild, and the sound they heard was not like anything they had heard before. Three other witnesses in their campsite, including two experienced campers, agreed. The witness talked to people in an adjacent campsite the next day, and they described the same sound, and also could not identify the animal that made it.There have been similar reported auditory observations near this location in the past.",
