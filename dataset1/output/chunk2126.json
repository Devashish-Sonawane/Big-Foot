            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to this witness and his son at length on May 1st 2012. He is a 25 year veteran of the Colorado Department of Corrections. On their way to go hunting, he and his son witnessed a bipedal figure crossing the road from Northwest to Southeast (from right to left) at approximately 5 am, a couple hours before sunrise, as they were driving south across a section of Highway 160 near LaVeta Pass. The figure was bent over and moving very fast, with the arms noticeably pumping. After crossing the highway the figure ran up a steep embankment and went over a 4 foot barbed wire fence at the top. Both the father and the son described the figure as grey and shaggy, with noticeable hair on the forearms. The father estimated they were approximately 40 to 50 yards away when they saw the figure. After the sighting they pulled off the road to attempt to determine the identity of the figure. As they were walking around shining a flashlight along the crossing path they heard two distinct whistles. The witness mentioned that this stretch of highway is a common Elk crossing point. It has been noted in many previous reports that Sasquatches hunt not only deer but various ungulates such as Elk. Hearing whistling sounds is also common and is often speculated to be a method of communication or alert.",
