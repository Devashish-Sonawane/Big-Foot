            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness on 03/21/2007. He is now living in Arizona.He had no way to accurately gauge the height, but thought the animal was taller than an average man. His guess at the height was between 6.5 and 7 feet tall. The height estimate is based in part on the height of a fence that the animal was walking along; the fence was approximately 5 feet tall.The witness describes the animal's face as hairless with very wide set eyes, a flat nose and a nearly flat muzzle. He believes that the animal he saw was male; the animal's chest was completely flat and covered in hair. The witness also noticed a \"suspicious bulge\" that would indicate male genitalia. However the witness was not one hundred percent certain as to what this bulge was.Unbeknownst to this witness when he reported the incident to the BFRO, his incident happened less than a week before the famous \"Memorial Day Footage\" was captured. That footage was obtained very near to this location, on the same lake.  This information had not been published anywhere previously.",

            "Observed": "I was deer hunting with a friend for whom I have known and hunted with for years. I was in my tree stand at about 9:15 am when I noticed a shape emerming from the tree's to my left, I then realized it was Scott. I notticed that there was something wrong with him because he was pale white, he was comming up the ridge extremly quick and was looking behind him at all time's. I motioned to him thinking that he might have been starteled by a big buck, but he let me know real quick that it was not so. Scott stoped at a stump to catch his breath and turned to look behind him once again at this time I became concerrd, for I have never seen him this scared. He finlly arived at my stand obviously extreamly distrubed, I climbed down from my stand and aked what was wrong. He explained to me that something which I chuckled at. He told me that something was behind him and got very disturbed with his presence, and started to stalk him in a very aggresive mannor. He then stood up to see what was walking around him ,when all of the sudden a horrible and terrifing yell shot through his body that shook him. He gathered his pack and proceeded to my stand. We talked and decided to investagate the situation due to the fact that we were camped 1\\2 of a mile away. What we found was very disturbing,trees snaped in half at 9 to 10 feet high, some very deep indindtions that were 12 to 14\" long. Normally that would be no big deal except it had not rained for some time. We followed the tracks for two miles until they went into extremly dence follage. I passed this of as the jitters but the next day I was stalked myself.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I called on this report and talked to D. M. (the witness writing the report). That morning he felt like he was being watched. He originally thought that it might have just been his friend, but later determined that it wasn't. He also mentioned that he heard the thing walking through the woods and that his marine training allowed him to recognize the fact that the \"creature\" that he was hearing was walking on 2 feet and not four. The two of them found broken branches and the impressions in the ground. These impressions were in pine needles. They were deep. As he mentioned in his report, it had not rained for a while and he was impressed by how deep the indentations were in the ground. He mentioned that this entire incident scared him quite a bit. Something watched him for 3 days. It maintained a distance and stayed on the downwind side of him the whole time. He found this very disquieting. He is 6'0\" tall and weighs over 220 lbs. He is an ex-marine. He indicated very clearly that nothing much scares him under normal circumstances, but that this time he was terrified. His friend (Scott) did hear a loud, unbelievable scream behind him during this set of incidents. Then he heard something break a tree (6\" - 7\" thick) up about 8 feet. Nothing else was seen or heard. As mentioned in the report, they went together later and saw the broken tree. This area is a 2.5 hour drive from where this guy lives. He lives in OK city and this is near the AK / TX border. During this whole time, he never saw the creature. He had something walk around him that night as well, but this might have been a bear. ",
