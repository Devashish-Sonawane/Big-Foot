            "Follow-Up Report": "In speaking with the witness, I found no issues of credibility as he related this incident.During the interview a few additional details and impressions surfaced.  The witness noted that what he observed in terms of the subject dashing across the creek and stepping over a fence were outside the capabilities of a person.  His thinking had progressed through a process of elimination in terms of animals and a person and had kept returning to what he felt was the only explanation for what he observed, a bigfoot.His physical description of what he observed centered on red eyes, impressive bulk and an oblong type of head.  He initially could see the shoulders and head in the weeds until his friend spoke.  At that point the subject looked up at him and he saw the red eye shine.  This observation was at a distance that he estimates at 10 - 15 yards and lasted for almost five minutes between the initial stare down and watching it flee across the creek and into the woods.  There was no noise during the incident except for the sound of it splashing through the creek and hearing it walk away.  He did not remark about any noticeable smells during the incident.I was also able to interview his friend during a separate telephone call.  His story was consistent with the witness, with the exception that his story was related from his viewpoint and experience during the incident.  Once he was able to get a look into the ravine and see what the witness was watching, he fled to the door of his home but was still able to watch and hear it flee across the creek.  He was also impressed with the bulk of what he saw, the red eyes and the color, which both describe as \u0093blacker than black\u0094.  The friend, who lives on the property, also remarked that since last September he has periodically heard a strange call that he says is loud enough to wake you.  He describes this sound as a mix between a wolf\u0092s howl and owl screeches.  He says some weeks he will hear it a few times, and then it might be quiet for a week or more and then return.On March 17, 2005, I conducted an on-site visit with the witness and his father.  I was able to have the witness go through a reenactment of the event, walk the property and take some selected photographs of the area.  I was particularly interested in seeing the layout of the property and the locations of the fire ring, the pole light, the home and where the creature was standing.   All of the above locations were very plausible, the fire ring was within four feet of the edge of the ravine and the pole lamp, which was relatively new, projected a strong light down into the ravine where the subject was observed to be standing.  There was also a very good field of view from the steps leading up into the home where his friend was standing after he fled from the edge of the ravine.  The weed patch was tall, but much of it had folded over from the creek being out of the banks since the incident and the effects of nearly two more months of weather.   The reenactment was very consistent with the written and verbal descriptions and plausible. ",
