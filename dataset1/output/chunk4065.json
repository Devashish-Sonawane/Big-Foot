            "Observed.1  ": "John Ray, of Marysville, and Rob Parker, of Snohomish, have spent years hunting in the old-growth forests of Snohomish County for evidence of Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch. They haven\u0092t convinced the scientific community, but the \u0093squatchers\u0094 say it\u0092s only a matter of time. Parker, 60, is a former policeman and compliance officer for the state Department of Labor & Industries. He now oversees safety for a Bellevue contractor. Ray, 49, works as a procurement agent and contract administrator for a \u0093large airplane manufacturer,\u0094 but he didn\u0092t want to say which. Recently, news broke that scientists determined DNA taken from hair samples attributed to Bigfoot in reality was from known animals. Those who say they\u0092ve seen one describe a stinky, ape-like creature covered with hair, standing about 10 feet tall. Parker and Ray understand that they\u0092re hunting something most people don\u0092t believe exists. But they can\u0092t shake the strange things they say they\u0092ve seen and heard in the woods. \u0093When you rule out everything that lives in that forest, what are you left with?\u0094 Ray said. \u0093You can\u0092t say it\u0092s not a Sasquatch.\u0094 On a July night, under a full moon, Ray and Parker each drove a truck along the Mountain Loop Highway, communicating on radios. \u0093We\u0092re going to see what jumps out in front of us,\u0094 Ray said. \u0093Hopefully, we\u0092ll get something big and bipedal.\u0094 They use technology to help them in their hunt: dash cams, thermal imaging cameras, their radios and audio recording equipment. Ray said he doesn\u0092t use night vision cameras because he\u0092s \u0093pretty sure\u0094 Bigfoot can see the light that\u0092s emitted. That\u0092s why, he continues, squatchers on Animal Planet\u0092s \u0093Finding Bigfoot\u0094 series haven\u0092t captured the creature on film. Ray appeared in an episode that aired in January 2013 called \u0093Sasquatch Spies.\u0094 Seeing Bigfoot, they say, is a matter of being in the right place at the right time. Parker said he came upon his first bigfoot by chance. He was fishing at Mount Si in 1969. \u0093There was this godawful, roaring scream,\u0094 he said. \u0093It was terrifying. It clearly did not want us there.\u0094 He said a hairy beast pulled a bush aside and peeked its head out. It stood and roared. At the time, Parker said, he didn\u0092t know what to make of it. Later, he read a book about Bigfoot. \u0093I thought \u0091son of a gun, it was a Sasquatch. Other people see them too,\u0092\u0094 he said. The pair serve as investigators with the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, a national group trying to prove the creature exists. The group collects reports of purported Sasquatch sightings and vet the claims. Ray and Parker were invited to join the exclusive group years ago after going squatching with BFRO members. \u0093They\u0092ve got to make sure you\u0092re not too crazy,\u0094 Ray joked. Parker said his investigative experience aids him in stalking Sasquatch and vetting other people\u0092s sightings. \u0093It\u0092s easy to tell when someone\u0092s telling you a whopper,\u0094 he said. Snohomish County, and the Mountain Loop, are considered hot spots for Bigfoot sightings, they said. Parker has been researching Sasquatch for the past four decades. In the 1970s, he worked with John Green, a retired Canadian journalist, author and leading Sasquatch researcher who is known as \u0093Mr. Bigfoot.\u0094 Parker also has his own group, Snohomish County Sasquatch. \u0093If you\u0092re not afraid to let people know you\u0092re a nut, the reports start coming out of the woodwork,\u0094 he said. Parker tracks the action on a topographic map. He and Ray also use the BFRO database to look for trends in activity and narrow their search. In the woods, the pair let out long, guttural howls and whoops. They also knock on wood, clack rocks and make game calls. \u0093I want to say \u0091hey look at these hairless dudes here,\u0092\u0094 Ray said. \u0093We\u0092re just trying to get them to hang out with us.\u0094 Ray started actively hunting the creatures following a BFRO expedition in 2008. A large, dark figure emerged on a ridge near his campsite, he said. \u0093I saw these two huge, glowing red eyes,\u0094 he said. \u0093They were the size of 50 cent pieces, nine feet off the ground.\u0094 The beast looked right at him. \u0093I just stood there with my mouth wide open,\u0094 Ray said. \u0093I never expected that would happen. I\u0092m a logical person.\u0094 That\u0092s when a hobby turned into something more. He was hooked. \u0093You get this thrill of seeing something that doesn\u0092t exist,\u0094 he said. Ray takes two of his sons, Michael, 16, and Christopher, 12, out on the bigfoot hunts. The boys are bait; children and women pique the creature\u0092s curiosity, Ray said. \u0093They like women and kids because we\u0092re not much of a threat,\u0094 Michael explained. That\u0092s why he\u0092s glad he\u0092s getting older. \u0093Now, I\u0092m no longer just bait,\u0094 he said. Still, he said, most of his friends think he\u0092s \u0093full of beans\u0094 when he tells tales of Sasquatch. On their July hunt, a full moon illuminated the Mountain Loop. The reputedly elusive creatures don\u0092t usually come out on a bright night. But when it comes to squatching, Ray and Parker heed one regard. \u0093If you weren\u0092t there. If you didn\u0092t see it. You can\u0092t say it happened \u0097 and you can\u0092t say it didn\u0092t,\u0094 Ray said.",
