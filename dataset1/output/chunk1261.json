            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness statement illustrates how significant a bigfoot sighting is. He vividly recollects the incident eighteen years after the fact. He did not feel threatened by the hairy creature because of the distance between them. He suspected that later the same night, their camp was visited by the creature. They were awakened by something walking around their camp early the next morning. Neither of them looked outside the tent, but could hear that it walked on two feet. The same year in October, he was performing a habitat survey as part of his Phd. The trail he was walking on ran along a ridge. Something below the trail attracted his attention by moving through the trees. He walked back and forth on the trail in an area of about 150 feet, trying to see what was down hill. He stopped for a few seconds and from behind him came a deep grunt. He turned to discover he was less than 20 feet from a 7+ foot sasquatch which had been watching him the entire time. He could see it from the mid-chest up, stating that it was an extremely large, terrifying sight. The two of them locked eye to eye for 10-15 seconds, then the animal grunted one last time, turned about and walked into the forest. He said to date it was the scariest situation he'd ever been in.

Me and my boyfriend were working for the Roanoke Times delivering newspapers when this encounter happened.  We delivered anywhere from 12am-6am. We were almost done with the route when we went to turn down this dead end maintenance road since there was houses at the end of that who got the paper.  It was around 3:30-4am. While My boyfriend was going down the gravel end maintenance road the headlights caught a glimpse of this thing standing right at where the grass met the road. It stood about 7ft tall and it took off up the hill. It kinda walked fast, not necessarily ran. It was dark brown and had shaggy hair like fur. It was on 2 feet and walked like a human with its arms swaying back in forth right below the knees.",
