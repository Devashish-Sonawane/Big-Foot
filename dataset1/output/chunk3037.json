I have worked extensively with exotic animals and lived in the wilds of Alaska, Colorado and Washington. I know that the cries I have heard while living at my current address are unlike any I have ever heard in my life. The only other time that I have heard anything similar was when I tuned into last nights program and listened to the recording that was replayed by the investigators in Aberdeen. I was relieved to know that what I heard was not my imagination and I could discontinue coming up with feeble excuses to explain what the noise was.",
