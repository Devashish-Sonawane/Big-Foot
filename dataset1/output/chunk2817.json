            "Observed": "This was in the early 80s,late spring early summer. i was still in High school ( Graduated in 1983)  Myself my two brothers and my best friend and his two brothers were in a field with our dogs goofing off,on top of a hill over looking a swamp bottom.We had been talking about and wondering why the cattle that stayed in this field never went to certain part of the field.( the area we were looking at).(We jokingly called this the Devils corner because of this).On this particular day the cattle had wandered into this area and were grazing. After about 10-15 mins of us sitting at the top of the hill talking about this we noticed that a few of the cattle looked very anxious and were looking toward the fence row that bordered the swamp area. We all started getting excited that the cows were scared of something, when all of a sudden the herd startled and began running up the hill out of that corner and bottom. Since we were in their path we moved and watched them run back to ward the south end of the field. Being curious we gathered up some weapons (logs,sticks,rocks) and decided to go see what was there, not expecting to see anything. We crossed the bottom and started toward the fence row.We noticed that it was extremely quiet in that corner of the field . We began to look around when we noticed some reddish hair stuck to the barbs on the fence.Then thought hey there are no reddish colored cows,so why is this hair this color and on the top row of 4 row barb wire fence ( fence was 5 ft at the highest point) we then heard something moving in the woods (very thick and dense,lots of thorns)where the hair was at. At this time i noticed that a pine tree roughly 5inches in diameter had been twisted and knocked over about 8-10 feet up.We hadnt had any storms recently and no other trees were damaged. We decided we should leave.As we started to leave my the younger",
