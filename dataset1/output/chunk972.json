            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness was interviewed for over 30 minutes on 8/26/2007 via telephone. She stated that they were in the back of a new housing development, just getting out of the house for a drive, and were driving very slowly down an undeveloped dirt road near the Devil's Gardens area. She said that she and her husband saw something come out of the woods and onto the road and was walking away from them in the same direction, along the road, far ahead of their position. At first she thought it was someone on horseback or on a bike, because it appeared to be quite tall. Also, she thought it would have to be someone on a bike or horseback if at all, because it was so far away from habitation and the weather was inclement; rainy and windy.They continued moving slowly in their car, looking at new roads under development, but kept an eye on the subject intermittently, as they grew closer, growing more curious of it and paying more attention as they went. As they approached to within about 100-150 feet, she realized that she could identify 4\"-6\" hair blowing sideways off its legs, and then she noticed the same with its arms, and finally its head, coming to the realization that it was hairy all over. Her husband braked the vehicle, which was only traveling around 5 mph and the brakes squeaked, causing the animal to startle, and it turned at an angle away from them and with 2-3 strides, it was in the palmettos and pines and out of sight. They had a brief discussion concerning the probable identity of the creature, coming to the same conclusion together.  They continued to traverse the cross roads of the area in hopes of seeing it again, but were unsuccessful. They did not think to look for footprints. This is a summary of the physical description of the creature. It was 6-7 feet tall, covered with black hair of 4-6 inches in length, and when asked the approximate weight, the witness replied, \"BIG! Very Big!\" It was described as having shoulders considerably broader than a big man, and was very muscular. The witness described actually seeing flexing of the underlying musculature as she watched in the final minute of her observation as it walked. The legs were described as stocky, though in proportion to the rest of the body as a human, while the arms were described as being longer,  just above the knee in length. The hair on its head whisped onto its shoulders, resulting in no visible neck. No ears were visible. No facial features were observed.Concerning its gait, it was described as slow and deliberate, \"It walked like a man\" but somewhat hunched forward, as one would against the wind. Interestingly, the witness stated that the arms did not swing in human-like fashion as it walked, but remained more hanging straight down.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with our witness for about ten minutes March 9th 2007. Her recollection of events were quite good. I discovered that her estimated distance from the bridge was incorrect. She was only one half mile from the Deception Pass bridge heading North on Highway 20. The bridge connects Whidbey Island to the mainland. Deception State Park is a very large protected park with old growth timber. She was a passenger in a vehicle traveling Northbound towards Deception Pass Bridge. The sun would have been low and filtering through the trees just as she confirmed.The human shaped figure was high up in the tree but leaning out and holding on with one hand. It was just watching the cars go by. It was back lighted with the setting sun so no distinguishing features other than the hint of a sloping head. It was only about a two second viewing. The speed limit is 40 mph but slows to 30mph as you approach the bridge. She didn't say anything to the driver for a few minutes until she could digest what she saw. By the time she was willing to discuss it there wasn't any point to turning around. The incident took place within  one mile of another BFRO report near Pass Lake. Deception State park in Washington state is a large undisturbed protected piece of land. It is a couple of square miles of old growth that has not been logged. It is still very primitive in some areas. An interesting side note: As I was looking for the location of the incident I notice a connecting road to Highway 20 named Monkey Hill Road. Very interesting...",
