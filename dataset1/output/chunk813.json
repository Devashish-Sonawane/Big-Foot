My friend and I took a horse back ride in Humboldt county, up the Salmon River, with a guide that has cabins there.  He takes care of these cabins, and they are about a three-hour horse back ride, up the river.  I met James, the guide, through Joe\u0092s Mom, because he was staying with her when I got to California. I can\u0092t remember James\u0092s last name.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On the evening of 30 January 2003, I made contact with M.B., in North Dakota.  M.B. is an American Indian, and he is twenty-three years old. He seemed believable in his rendition of his encounter, which took place in Siskiyou County, California, during the summer of 2000.   On the first sighting, M.B. and friends were about 30 yards away, and the creature was on the other side of the river, going in the same direction as they were heading, just walking. That\u0092s when James through a rock at it. The total time of the sighting was about five to six seconds.The second sighting was further up the trail and they were about a hundred feet or so up the hill from it, and from M.B.\u0092s perspective, on horseback, the creature looked to be about three inches tall. That sighting was very short one, less than five seconds. The creature was still on the other side of the river, and still going in the same direction as they were, which was up the river.On the third encounter, the boys were standing on rocks in the river fishing, and the creature was just on the other side of the river standing in some heavy brush.  M.B. estimated the distance at about fifteen feet away.  The creature was just standing there, watching the boys fishing, and rubbing its face or nose with one of its hands, maybe like picking its nose.  When they both realized it was standing there, they both turned and took off for the cabin, and James.  He said this encounter probably lasted less than fifteen seconds.Some of the specific questions I asked about the creature are as follows:*Could you describe any facial features? \u0093Yes, I could see the pupils in its eyes, and around the pupil was a yellowish color, like someone with hepatitis. The nose looked like what a Neanderthal nose would look like. It was not real flat, but still didn\u0092t look like our nose ether. No hair on the face, and the face was dark in color.\u0094*What would you think its height and weight to have been? \u0093This is an estimate only, it looked to weigh about four or five hundred pounds, and it seemed like it was about seven to eight feet tall.\u0094*Did it have anything like hair on its body, and what color was it?  \u0093Yes it had what looked like a dirty brownish black hair on most of its body, except for the face and the palms of its hands. There were also some spots that were a little lighter in color.\u0094 *Did you see it walking or was it ever down on all fours?  \u0093We only saw it walking or standing, but we never saw it down on all fours. When the creature was walking, it looked exactly like the Patterson film that I had seen on the Discovery Channel.\u0094*Could you describe the arms?  \u0093They were large and thick.\u0094*Could you tell if it was a male or female?  \u0093I think it was a male, because I did not see any breasts.\u0094*Did it ever make any noise with its mouth or any other way? \u0093No!\u0094*Did you ever smell anything? \u0093No!\u0094*Did you see any ears on it? \u0093NO! This was no bear, because I hunt bears, and I know what they look like for sure, and this was no monkey or ape ether.\u0094 *Did it ever see you?  \u0093Yes! For sure, two times at least.  It seemed like it wanted to know just what are we doing here, and/or what do you want.\u0094*Did you or any one else with you ever check for prints?  \u0093No, not that I know of.\u0094*Did you ever report what you saw to an agency or a friend? \u0093No, just my mother when I was typing this out. I don\u0092t want people to think that I was crazy.\u0094*In your opinion what do think this creature was?  \u0093Well for sure it was not a bear, monkey, or an ape. I think it was something like a Neanderthal.\u0094  In summery: Note, the highway number M.B. was not sure about is 96.  Please be advised, Orleans Ca. is just inside the Humboldt county line, but the sightings took place in Siskiyou County.  Per the report writer, they turned right off of the highway and headed up the Salmon River, which put them in Siskiyou County. I believe that M.B. had several sasquatch sightings during his trip to James\u0092s cabins, in Siskiyou County.  One of M.B.\u0092s first thoughts when he first saw this creature, was he was having a heat stroke, or something like it.  I am hopeful that we will be able to talk to his friend Joe and the guide James, sometime in the near future.  ",
