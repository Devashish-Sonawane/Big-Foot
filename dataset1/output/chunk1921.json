I got off work at 5, picked up my kids from daycare, stopped at the local sub shop and headed out of town.  My son was in the front seat with me and my daughters were in the back.  We had just left Gladstone City limits on the four lane highway heading northeast to our hometown of Rapid River, when I noticed what I thought was a hunter crouched down on the opposite side of the median of the highway.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Kristin on the phone this evening, almost 10 years after she reported the sighting and almost 24 years after the actual sighting. One of the very first things she said was she remembers it like it was yesterday and then started to tell me about what happened that day. She also updated the location as the highway has changed due to Road Construction in the last decade, with changed to the median, emergency exits and crossover roads. Kristin said she now understands how the Bigfoot was able to just disappear as it stepped into the tag alders as there is a fence there with an opening in that spot. The fence and the opening were not visible at the time of the sighting but with the changes to the highway and shoulders it is now visible. This report predates other published reports in the same area.http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=56552http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=47439The area has sufficient cover, food and water for Bigfoots and other large predators native to the area.",
