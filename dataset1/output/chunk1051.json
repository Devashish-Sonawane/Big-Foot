            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with the witness about the incident. I can add the following to his report. As stated he had been driving the back roads in an isolated area. He noted that he had not seen nor heard any motorized vehicles. He is a bow hunter and considers himself versed in the sounds of the local woods. He was fairly certain that he was the only person in the immediate area. It was later in the day, maybe four o'clock in the afternoon, when he stopped his car at this spur road. He related that he did hear wood knocking as he was leaving his car. At the time he had no idea of the term, wood knocking, he assumed  it to be only a human behavior. He described the sounds as three successive bangs, two solid pieces of wood coming together.  He continued on his way to pick berries. Then he heard wood knocking again, with the same type of pattern. Three bangs and then silence. He determined that the sounds were coming from above him in a densely covered reprod (replanted clear cut). He also estimated the distance to be approximately 200 yds. I asked him if he had any personal fear associated with the experience? He paused..., then said no, just confusion from not knowing what could be making those knocks. I asked him if he heard any tapping sounds?... NO. Did the sounds come from one location or move around? They just came from one location. I asked could the sounds have been gun shots? ....No, they sounded like wood on wood. After a short time, he decided to leave since he could not determine what was making these sounds. Having grown up in the area, he is familiar with the local sasquatch lore. Periodically he has talked with people that have a bigfoot story. At the time of the incident, he did not associate  wood knocking with bigfoot behavior. Then, through discovery on the internet, he read reports of this type of bigfoot activity. He thought, hey I have heard this before and decided it was important enough to file a report. I know this area well. I can confirm that I too have heard and recorded wood knocking sounds.",

It starts off winding through woods and while curving to the right we saw this gigantic light brown to dark tan hairy figure cross from right to left.  I couldn't see the head because it was above the area illuminated by the truck lights, but I saw that the shoulders were at least three feet across, and at the shoulders it was at least 8-8.5 feet tall, and while it ran I could see the arm/shoulder movement and the thighs move as well.  With how steep the area it was that it went down, and how wooded and rainy it was I don't think a human could navigate its way down there as quickly as it did, because by the time I had stopped and gotten out it was gone, but you could hear the crashing of it moving through the brush and trees.",
