I work for a monitoring lab that conducts late-night bat surveys.  Very recently we were commissioned to do a survey to look for Myotis sodalis, the Indiana bat.  We had to make sure that the bats were not roosting on an active mine site.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "A fellow investigator and I  proceeded to the sighting location two weeks after the incident. We arrived on site, secured entry through security and entered the mine. The area is actively mined in two separate locations. The northernmost was where the witness had multiple incidents. We scouted two stream channels which were almost dry that weekend. We followed the witnesses directions to the site where he and his co-workers spent their final night. There was ample evidence of their campsite. The witness described the campfires which looked to be hastily abandoned. My associate and I used the same location for our night of surveillance.  We gathered firewood and set up our equipment for the evening.There was considerable noise from mining activities until around 11 PM. The equipment shut down as the 2nd shift departed for the weekend. Once the hollow was quiet, we listened for unusual sounds until about midnight. The only visitor to our camp was the Indiana Bat. Several of these large mammals flew past our heads. We talked quietly and listened for any visitors until 4 AM.  At approximately 6 AM we struck camp and headed home.While we did not hear anything out of the ordinary during the short time we were there, the location was ideal for a reclusive animal. The woods are thick and varied in the makeup of hardwood species, water was readily available, human activity is restricted to work sites, and non employees are restricted by security.",
