            "Follow-Up Report": "After interviewing the witness and gathering more details, I went to the site of the incident to investigate the encounter further on 11/17/07.  We went to what we believed to be the site, based on the witness' directions.  We found a trail leading away from the gravel pit. We followed the trail, which is really an old, overgrown logging road, to where it met a creek. The road used to go across the creek, but the culvert had been removed or washed out.  We could see the road on the other side. We then followed the trail to the right on up the hill.  We found three impressions.  Each impression was 13 \" long, and 5 \" wide, one an obvious track with toes visible. We also found one tree break where the fir tree had been broken so as to possibly block the trail.  It was suspicious because it fell in a direction opposite the prevailing wind, and there was no other visible mechanism to explain the manner in which it was broken. We also noted many rubs from both deer and elk.  They were fresh from this summer.  A good food source for sasquatches.What we found at the site suggests that the witness and her sister were very possibly scared out of the woods by a sasquatch.The sasquatch was at the top of this slope and charged down the slope at the two girls.The sasquatch stopped in these trees, and the girls were standing approximatly where the two people in this photograph are standing.  By the time it got to the trees, the girls were running.",
