            "Observed": "My wife and I with our three month old baby girl in the back seat were traviling N.E. on Highway 40/Route 66 through the mountains near Flagstaff, AZ.  This was right in the middle of a snowstorm.  I stopped to read the map and reasure our directions.  While looking at the map, I turned the rear view mirror light on to help see the map.  in the mirror I caught sight of a huge manlike figure running up behind the vehicle, I turned to get a better look and my wife turned too.  She screamed (Oh My God)!  It was clear to see a huge hairy (black & brown) furry being. It was very tall, large head and long arms, running on two feet toward our vehicle.  No other vehicles or tracks in the snow.  Large pine trees bordered the highway.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on the phone and the following details can be added:The witness & his young family were on their way home to Denver from Los Angeles for the Christmas holidays in December 1973 when the sighting occurred. In the late afternoon, while traveling on Route 66 just west of Flagstaff, AZ, the witness hit a strong snowstorm and pulled off the side of the road to gain his bearings and check his map. He thought he might be lost because he hadn't seen another vehicle for miles and didn't even see any tire tracks in the snow covering the highway. He was driving a VW beetle vehicle, which he left idling on the south side of the highway.While looking for the map, he glanced up to catch the sight of what appeared to be a large, bulky, two-legged figure running toward their stopped car from the rear. He mentioned that the figure had unusually long arms and legs for a man. The head appeared pyramid shaped but rounded on top. It appeared to be covered in black or brown dark fur and no clothes were observed. From his vantage point inside the car, he estimated the figure's height to be near 10 feet tall. He quickly put the car in gear (he felt threatened and that his family might be in danger) and tried to accelerate away from the fast approaching figure. The witness stated that the creature actually chased his car and came within 15 feet of the rear of his vehicle before he reached a speed of 45 mph and began to put some distance between himself and the figure. The figure remained on 2 legs for the duration of the encounter and at one point even raised its arms over its head. At the time, the witness was 24 years old and a member of the US Navy and DID NOT believe in the existence of Bigfoot type creatures. He said that he assumed any reports of those creatures, or the Yeti, were hoaxes or just imagined by people. This experience changed his perspective and he's now a firm believer in the existence of Sasquatch. He currently works for the US Mint in Denver. When asked why he thought it wasn't a human, he responded that they did consider the possibility of a stranded motorist seeking help, but that he didn't see anything that would indicate another human was anywhere near his position...no other vehicles of any sort (broken down or otherwise), no tire tracks in the snow, no headlights, nothing. Also, the figure \"was too tall to be a normal human being; the head was too large and did slope down towards the shoulders. The speed at which it was running in the snow was amazing.  The face was pretty much covered with the same color as the rest of its body, almost black in color.  Maybe a little bit lighter.\"",

I WAS ALSO SITTING IN A DEER STAND IN THE PITCH BLACK AND POURING RAIN THAT MORNING. I WAS IN FOREST COUNTY WHICH IS NORTH OF CAMBRIA COUNTY.

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking to this witness about this encounter I can add some details to his report.On a cold, crisp morning, during the early dawn hours before the sun had come up, he was rummaging through his backseat to get out his gun before climbing a hill to his tree stand. Upon hearing a noise between 20-50 yards away, he turned and saw a \u0091large, massive figure, about 6 to 6 \u00bd foot tall stand up from a thick stand of thickets. He described the figure as being very tall, but not abnormally tall. Being that it was still very dark he could not make out any facial details or color. He could only see it in silhouette at that time and said that there were no light sources other than the background of the sky. He said that the dome light in his car was not on. At this point he could not be certain if it was a human or not.Immediately after the figure stood up, it ran across a small clearing and scaled the hillside in just a few moments. The hillside went up approximately 70 yards at a 45-degree angle and it completed this route in mere seconds. It did make some noise as it ascended the hill in the way of breaking branches and twigs.The witness told me that for him to climb that same ascent, he would have to pull himself up using trees to grasp onto and that it would take him at least 10 to 15 minutes to climb. When asked if it was possible that this figure was a known animal, he was adamant that it was not. \u0093I know that it wasn\u0092t a bear or a deer. At first I thought that it could have been a man, but no man could have climbed that hill so quickly. It just couldn\u0092t have been a human.\u0094After seeing the creature scale that hill in just moments, he admitted that the episode gave him \u0091chills\u0092. He did, however, resume his hunt and scaled the same hill that the figure had just scaled. Once he got into his deer stand he did not see any animals and noticed that the woods were abnormally quiet. \u0093I didn\u0092t see any birds, squirrels or anything. It was oddly quiet.\u0094To this day he recalls that morning with mixed emotions. \u0093I never felt like I was in any danger from the creature when I saw it. But I was chilled by the thought of it being so close to me. I still go hunting, but now I am always thinking about it, especially when I drive close to that area. And after I saw that creature I am uneasy about being in the woods after dark.\u0094He commented that the surrounding area is mostly rural and mixed with forests and farmlands. \u0093I just couldn\u0092t understand why a Bigfoot would be in this area\u0094. After further investigation I found that there is an abundance of deer in the area as well as numerous wildlife corridors that connect to several vast parcels of unpopulated preserves. After reviewing the aerial map of this area it is conceivable that sasquatches might temporarily habituate this area in order to take advantage of the easily obtainable food sources such as the numerous deer population that lives there as well as the fields of crops that are grown nearby. I found this witness to be both forthright and sincere in his description of his encounter. According to him the creature that he saw was within the dimensions of a human, although taller and more massive than most. But to scale a 45-degree hillside that is 70 yards high with little effort and within moments is far outside what a human could achieve. ",
