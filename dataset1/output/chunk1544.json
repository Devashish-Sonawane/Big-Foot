            "Observed": "One night in early April of 1994, my two daughters and I were driving in our car, headed west, on SR 16 near Penny Farms in Green Cove Springs, Florida. The stretch of road was lightly scattered with houses, but had mostly dense wooded areas with an occasional cow pasture. The weather was clear with a light night fog. As we approach one of the more deserted areas along the road, I spotted something off to the right hand side of the road. At this point it was not clear as to what it was. I slowed down a bit thinking it may be a dog or animal. I've commonly seen many nocturnal animals along this stretch of road in the past. As we approached somewhat closer, it stepped out into the path of the car. We, at this time, were moving approximately 20 MPH as the animal came in to direct headlight. I was stunned to see that which I had assumed would be a raccoon, actually stood at least 6 to 7 feet tall, walked on two legs, and was covered with brown hair, (was somewhat skinny). I completely stopped the car as it crossed the road. A car coming in the opposite direction stopped as well. I almost could not come to terms with what my eyes were seeing. My oldest daughter, which was nine years old at the time, said \"oh my gosh! What is that?\u0094 It crossed the road quickly into the thick brush on the left hand side of the road. Once again she said \"Dad, what was that?\" I sat there with my mouth hanging open, then tried to think of what to say that wouldn\u0092t spook her. We had just passed a cow pasture about 30 feet prior, so I babbled, \"I a...a...a think it was a cow.\" We drove silently for a few miles. The whole time I'm thinking to myself, \"You just saw a Skunk Ape\". She then turned to me and said, \" Dad, cows don't walk on two legs... Looked more like a Bigfoot to me.\" I stuck with my ridiculous \"cow story\" until she was much older. She's now 18 years old, and we've laughed about the cow story for years. These days we both use each other as our witness that on that April in 1994 we both did truly indeed see a Bigfoot. My youngest daughter was asleep in the back seat during the entire event. But she says she has seen plenty of cows anyway. Cows... INDEED!",

            "Observed": "My first of two encounters with a Bigfoot occurred in Eldridge Iowa during the first two weeks of February 1981. I was a paperboy for the Des Moines Register. I would usually start my rout at about 5:00 am in the morning. About week prior to this incidence I started having this feeling that I was being watched and even followed though I never saw or heard anything up to this point. On this particular morning about half way through my rout I came around the corner of 5th St and Donahue Ave. riding my bike loaded with newspapers when I looked down and saw this trail of very large footprints in the snow. I got off of my bike and knelt down and took a closer look thinking that this was some kind of prank. I even counted the number of toes, 5 on each foot and it look just like a human footprint only much larger! The prints were about 6 to 8 inches wide and about 18 to 24 inches long. I remember I slowly stood up and looked around and noticed the tracks came in from the northeast side of Eldridge and cut through people\u0092s back yards and exited the southwest side of town. I remember feeling very alone and scared out of my mind! The worst was yet to come later in the week when I had to deliver the Sunday paper. After school that day I went back and followed the track northeast to southwest all the way though Eldridge and across a small park called Elmer Green park. It was here that the reality of what I had just discovered really started to sink in. when the tracks came to a four-foot high fence on the other side of the park you could see that the creature just stepped over it like it wasn\u0092t ever there! I followed the tracks all the way back to the City of Eldridge sewer treatment ponds were I usually hunted rabbits. The tracks followed Hickory creek around behind the sewer treatment ponds and it was here that I stopped following the tracks out of fear because I was alone.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness in a phone interview and found the clarity and detail of his memory to be quite vivid. Some new detail was added, but was primarily textural. The events of this memorable week remain the same. The witness was 13 years old at the time.From Jan. 19, 1981 to Feb. 4, 1981 there were two weeks where it got noticeably quiet. It was like the noise was shut off. There was very little wind. Witness would stop four or five times during the route and listen because it was so unusual. An arctic blast had brought frigid temperatures to the area and he was running his route quickly each morning. On Feb. 4th, witness found a set of tracks running from NE to SW toward the sewage treatment ponds. He followed the tracks for about one mile along a creek to the sewage ponds, where the trail continued on, but when he reached the ponds he got a panicked feeling. On the way back he got an adrenalin rush and was suddenly desperate to get to Buttermilk Division Road looking over his shoulder all the way. Witness states that when he first encountered the tracks he realized right away that they were not a hoax, and so he immediately started keeping track of events as they occurred. He got down on his hands and knees and gave the prints close scrutiny. When the tracks crossed a road, a foot print on the curb conformed to the curvature of the curb and gutter. That night at 10:20 this witness took time, while collecting for the paper, to walk to where the tracks were, and saw that there was still the single set heading to the SW. He showed the tracks to a friend.  I asked about this friend and he has long since lost contact with him. At 5:30 the next morning, on Thursday the 5th, he found tracks in the opposite direction perfectly following the first set. At this point he freaked. On Friday he did his route in full panic mode. There were still no sounds along the way. Saturday it was still dead quiet. On Sunday the 8th witness did route in the car with his father, and at the end of the route he was screamed at when he bounced a rolled up Des Moines Sunday Register off a front door. The scream came from between the house where he had just delivered the paper, and the house next door. The scream sounded like it contained very high frequency and very low frequency sounds simultaneously. Witness states that his gut instinct told him that the scream was from a male. He says it sounded like a civil defense siren. The week of Feb. 23rd the animal sounds came back. The weather warmed up as well. In the first part of April witness gave up the route. He was too scared to continue, and states that he was beyond freaked out. Oddly, within 2 to 3 months after incident, the local Quad City Times newspaper ran an article stating that the outlying areas of the Quad Cities (Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa, and Rock Island and Moline, Illinois) would be perfect habitat for sasquatch.",
