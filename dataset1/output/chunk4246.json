            "Observed.1  ": "Sasquatch is real to some and myth to others.  The Spokesman-Review last Sunday invited readers to respond to the following question: Do you believe in the existence of Sasquatch? Is Bigfoot a reality? On what do you base your opinion? Following is a representative sampling of letters received: Seen in Illinois In response to the question in the paper, I do believe in the existence of Sasquatch. He us a reality. I base my opinion on the fact that I have seen him. My husband's and my encounter with him was about 15 years ago in a picnic area in the woods in Tinley Park, Illinois. It was night and quite clear out. We had heard some noise that sounded like an animal moving around in the trees, which we paid little attention to at first. Then the sounds became louder and suddenly there was a loud cracking sound. As we turned around, about 15 feet away was a large tree with a rather large limb broken from it. Standing near the broken limb was a huge dark figure. The moonlight was quite bright and he stood at least seven feet tall or better. He was shaped like a huge ape, but his eyes were slanted and glowed with a greenish color. We watched for a few minutes not knowing exactly what we were seeing. Then the creature moved slowly towards us and sat down in the manner that an ape does, with arms hanging down. With that we got in the car and left, as we did not know what to expect from this creature. But we did report the sighting as it was unbelievable. Not too long after our sighting many more people reported it, which brought in many scientists to look for Bigfoot. There have been too many sightings across the nation to say that Bigfoot does not exist. Many a fisherman and hunter have seen him but say nothing because of people calling them crazy. There will be more and more sightings as long as man pushes deeper and deeper into the forests and starts to crowd the creature out. Whether we will ever capture him is another story, as he seems to have the instinct of an animal and can think to some degree like a man. He is capable of fast moving and is able to disappear quickly. He has been here for some time, and whether he is from this planet or another is what has to be discovered, since he has been seen right after UFO sightings. I keep a scrapbook going on all sighting of the creature as there is no doubt in my mind that he is a reality. These sightings in Illinois can be validated in Joliet, Illinois, at the police station.
