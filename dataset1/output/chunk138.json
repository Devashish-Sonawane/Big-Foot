I was fishing and there was about 4 Beaver-Tail slaps on the water so I knew there would'nt be any smallies hanging around. I took a few more casts and caught a Dace. Its like a sucker with the body of a trout. Very silver in color and unedible. I was trying to get the fish off my hooks when I heard something heavy about 45 yrds away from me cracking sticks as it approached from the road onto the freshly cut brush (from the work they did around there, days prior).",

            "Follow-Up Report": "While talking with the gentleman through a phone conversation, he was excited to hear that someone was actually looking into his incident. A incident, that has been burnt into memory. On this night, he was walking down the road when he decided to go down near the water, the water was very low at this time of year, where as it gets drained every year. While standing down by the water he heard 3-4 beaver tail slaps, thinking that the beavers were trying to get him out of the area. About 2 mts. later he heard foot steps coming towards him, he recalls them to be about 45 ft. away, he heard a snap, thinking that it might be a person walking thru, or he was going to get yelled at for being there. He yelled up and asked \"who's there\" with no answer, he started to get nervous, he then heard another snap of a twig or limb, now he knew it was time to go, as he started to walk away from the edge of the water, he could hear something moving away, he tried shining his light in the direction of the foot steps but the light was just about dead. He saw eye shine (7.5-8 ft) off the ground. At that moment he heard a sound that he has never heard before, he describes it to be a screaming / howl, that vibrated in his chest. He could hear it moving up out of the woods and across the road, that's when he decided to get out of the area an ran to his car. Like he told me in the interview, it is a moment in his life that he will never forget.. I am familiar with this area, it has an abundance of vegetation, fresh water and wildlife. We will monitor the area and keep in touch with the witness. ",
