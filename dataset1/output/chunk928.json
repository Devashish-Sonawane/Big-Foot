            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this gentleman by phone on August 13 for roughly 45 minutes. We talked about other hunting experiences and a few hair-raising encounters he had with bears and mountain lions.  I found him to be a knowledgeable hunter and outdoorsman.  What was different about this event was the way the animal paralleled his movements and that the \"thrashing\" in the brush grew louder and more active as he walked further from his truck, but softened as he walked back toward it.  Also of note, was that he describes his feeling as being a deep, primal or instinctual kind of fear or trepidation.  Nothing like he felt when he had close encounters with large predators.The witness told me he returned the next day with some hunting buddies, stepped off the road where he had experienced the \"thrashing\" but could find no obvious signs of whatever may have been there.  However, when they were hunting through a valley beyond Coal Lake a couple days later, they came across an area with a lot of small trees (\"2-3 inches in diameter\") that had been \"folded so they looked like a straw when you bend it.\" He and his friends did find possible \"stick structures like big X's\" in the valley where they found the bent trees.  I went to the location on August 16 with fellow Investigator, John Ray, but our desire to make calls was limited due to campers in the area.  I returned the next day during daylight but was unable to find any evidence of animal movement where the witness had indicated.  It is exceedingly steep terrain, which limited my ability to fully examine it.  I believe this gentlemen is credible and that he experienced something so unusual as to cause him to stay up until 3AM the next morning just to report it and to get it off his chest.",

Before reaching the area of houses, I spotted what looked like a young pre-teen holding a tall stick vertically.  Suddenly, the other than human walked on hands and feet to the middle of the road and then stood erect.  My realtor slammed on the breaks and cried, \"What is that?\"  I suggested a bear but the shape of the head was not that of a bear.  We agreed it was not a monkey due to no long tail and.  It appeared to be 4.5 to 5ft. tall.  It disappeared into the woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was looking at property to buy in Ormond Beach in the spring 1985 with a realtor. Both ladies were in a car driving west on Addison Drive around 1 pm.  The road borders a green area and connects with several state parks. Google earth image of the location:As they drove they noticed a \u0093teenager\u0094 standing on the roadside holding a stick. As they neared, it dropped down and they thought out loud it was a bear.  It began to cross the road left to right in front of them, acting unafraid. They had to slam on the brakes not to hit it. One commented that it was a strange looking bear, and then the \u0093bear\u0094 stood up and became bipedal.  It looked at them as it crossed about 10 feet in front of the car in a slow easy gait. Once it passed the car it dropped back down to quadrapedal, and briefly paused to look back at them before going into the woods. It was about 4 \u00bd to 5 feet high, \u0093wooly\u0094 dark brown, and looked more ape than human. It had long limbs and looked taller because of the lankiness. One lady compared it to the size and weight of an average 12 year old boy although its head seemed smaller. The head didn\u0092t have as much hair on it as the body did. The women were amazed at what they were seeing and the realtor commented that she was worried about what her client was thinking as to what wild creatures lived in the area. They realized it was not a bear, but couldn\u0092t figure out what it could have been.  It did not have bear ears or a tail; it was too big to be a monkey, but wasn\u0092t a gorilla. They had heard that bigfoots were much bigger, so didn\u0092t think of that either.  They never considered that it could have been a juvenile sasquatch.Juvenile sasquatch behavior has been reported many times to go from quadrapedal to bipedal and back. They have also been described as looking more \u0093ape like\u0094 than the full grown ones. This location borders Tomoka State Park, Addison State Park, and Bulow Creek State Park. Bulow Creek Park has had several reports over the years.  See report #34426 , report #31680 and report #19232.This report came about from a mention in report #12068. I was given a name and was able to speak with the client. She had not spoken to the realtor since 1985 but recalled her name. I was able to find her in another part of the state. She confirms working on weekends that spring and seeing something strange in the road with a client, but couldn\u0092t recall details. She admitted that since she is now in her late 70\u0092s there are many things she can\u0092t remember. ",
