            "Follow-Up Report": "This report was filed by a witness who was bow hunting with his 19 yr old son. I visited with both men at the site where they offered to take me, some 40 miles (approx 1.5 hours) from the nearest town. They had camped without campfire on the moonlit night of August 31, 2012 in a remote site together in their tent in anticipation of an early morning hunt. They continued to remind me that this was an extremely unusual event for them, as they had spent most of their lives being very comfortable in the woods, and were pretty horrified from their experience. The father and son described the encounter occurring between 11:30 PM and approximately 4 AM. At about 11:30, the father said that he was awakened by what he thought was the sound of \u0093footsteps\u0094 and attributed the sound to a \u0093deer or elk, or bear\u0094 and went back to sleep. Later while the father slept, the son who had not fallen asleep so far that night, observed a large hand pressing on the tent, as well as hearing vocalizations from the subject closest to the tent that he described as \u0093mumbling\u0094 with another subject farther from the tent in the trees. The son said at that point he hid inside his sleeping bag, afraid to look.The father said he was awakened again by footsteps, only this time the sound was in the vicinity of his truck, and apparently \u0093someone was rummaging around in the back of his truck.\u0094 It was at that time that he noticed his son\u0092s distress, as his son was convulsively shivering from fear, head completely covered within his bag. Both men had to go to the bathroom, so they both deliberated stepping out of the tent for some time, all the while hearing the presence of two bipedal subjects circling the campsite in the forested area outside of the perimeter. They noted that there would be quiet, but when they would begin to talk, they could hear footfalls in the woods, only to go silent when they stopped talking. The father described this experience as similar to his stalking technique where he would shadow elk.Eventually the two men exited the tent to relieve themselves, and while doing so, both men observed large dark silhouetted figures in the tree line and on the road leading to the campsite. The father had brought his flashlight with him, and shined it on the figure in the road. He described an approximately 8-1/2 foot tall upright figure with its head turned away from the light beam. The subject had dark brown, almost black hair, and was holding a very large arm and hand up to shield its eyes from the intensity of the flashlight.After this both men returned to the tent, still believing they were seeing things, and waited while two bipedal subjects continued stalking-type behavior around their campsite. As the witness described in his initial report, they gave up and left the area in a rush.During the entire interview process, both men were shaking and appeared to still be in fear. At one point, the relating of the encounter by the son appeared to be unusually charged with emotion. I video-documented my discussion with them and after numerous repeat views determined that their account of the experience was thorough and factual to the best of their descriptive ability.I examined the surrounding area of woods and the campsite and found no tracks or track way as the area was very dry, rocky, and/or ground covered with forest floor duff.",

            "Observed": "My wife and I were returning from Galion, Ohio back to our home southeast of Mt. Gilead. As we approached the intersection of SR 61 and TR 75 I noticed a large black thing run (west to east) across the road about .25-.1 mi ahead. We looked at each other and asked, \"Did you see that?\". We both saw the same thing. I slowed down to see if we could see when it went, no such luck we didn't see anything more of it. It sent chills down our spines. We talked about it a few more minutes and then the subject changed to something else. Later that evening I telephoned a friend in Columbus and told my story. As I was describing its gait to my friend--just like the classic bigfoot film footage on TV. My wife then looked at me and said, \"That is exactly as I had seen it\".",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Telephone and in-person interviews were conducted with both witnesses and no issues of animal misidentification were evident. The investigation also included visiting the site of the incident.  The event had such a strong impact upon the male witness that he exhibited genuine distress as we drove through the sighting area and I had him describe what he saw.We discussed the possibility that they had spotted a person crossing the road, but the witnesses were adamant that what they saw was too large to be a human and did not have a human gait. They added that the arms were wrong, too long and the motion was not right for a person walking or running. He added that the behavior of not looking for traffic before crossing a state highway was contrary to how people cross roads.The location of the sighting is fairly typical rural Ohio with a mixture of crop fields and wood lots. There was corn growing on the west side of the highway at the time, with a tree line and an old unused farm lane to the east.Morrow County, Ohio does have a number of sightings from over the years. These sightings do seem to be concentrated in the summer months.",
