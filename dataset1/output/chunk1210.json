            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was fifteen at the time of the sighting.  His cousin and friend were both sixteen.  The friend\u0092s mother was home with her two daughters.  He did not live in this area at the time, but he visited frequently to see relatives.The witness was camping with his friend and cousin behind his friend\u0092s house.  The woods behind the house were extensive at the time, extending back several miles.  The witness said he had often explored those woods as a child.  There were deep creeks and some caves on the property.  Wildlife was abundant in the area.  The edge of the woods was a few hundred yards from the house across an overgrown field.  A motorcycle path cut through the growth to the campsite.After pitching a tent and starting a campfire in the field, the campers were about to cook their meal of hot dogs and hamburgers.  They had not yet started grilling when the witness smelled a strong urine smell and heard a large animal quickly approaching through the brush.  He could hear it running through the woods.Frightened, the boys abandoned their camp and ran towards the house along the motorcycle path before they could see the animal.  After the boys had run about 50 yards, the creature appeared in the field and pursued the campers.  The witness said it was fast and covered the ground between them quickly, despite the boys being athletic and the animal running through the overgrown field.Once inside the house, the boys told the mother what had happened.  The friend\u0092s mother laughed at them, but they insisted that they had seen a tall hairy animal.  The three boys then ventured back outside to see if they could check on the status of their campsite-the campfire could not be left alone-and possibly view the animal again.  The animal could not be seen and the boys returned to the site.  They briefly inspected the area and had just decided to break down the camp.  At that time, the animal quickly approached the camp again.  The boys retreated back towards the house.   The animal then came into the camp.  The witness paused about thirty yards from the creature.  He said he could see it standing over the fire, reaching down and throwing two or three logs out.Back inside the house, the boys again told the mother what they had seen.  She dismissed their story and went outside to tend to laundry on a clothesline.  After catching a glimpse, she came back inside \u0093scared to death.\u0094  Two family dogs came in with her and stayed with the family members.  The creature then proceeded to circle the house several times, occasionally stepping onto the porch.  The wood porch could be heard creaking loudly from the weight of the animal.  The witnesses were too frightened to look outside and huddled together in a corner.  The witness was worried the animal could break into the house at any time.  The animal eventually left approximately an hour and a half after it was first seen.  The group spent the night in the house talking about it.The next day, the boys went out and looked for tracks.  The ground was too dry to show any evidence of tracks.  However, the witness did report seeing branches broken high up.  He could discern the path the creature took as the animal approached them.The witness was able to view the creature for 30 seconds to a minute while it was throwing logs out of the fire, which provided enough visibility to see some details.  The witness described the creature as being 7-1/2 to 8 feet tall with a large build and long arms.  It was covered with long hair, but the face was hairless.  The hair was described as black, but it could have been lighter.  The face appeared to be neither  human or gorilla.  The head was pointed.  It easily weighed 400 lb.  The witness assumed the animal to be male from the build, but no genitalia was visible to him.  The witness does not remember any vocalizations.The witness is confident this animal was neither a bear or a person in a costume.  There is no resident black bear population in Davie County or the surrounding counties.  The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission has no verified observations of any black bears in the county from 1971 through 2001.The witness has lost contact with his childhood friend.  Many years have passed since he has seen his cousin.  The witness will contact his cousin and ask if he is willing to speak with the BFRO.  I asked the witness about any other stories in the area.  About three years ago, domestic animals and pets in the area started disappearing and being killed.  State wildlife authorities investigated but did not reach any conclusions regarding what was responsible.  The witness remembers in particular, two large rottweilers being killed inside their dog pen.  Dogs were found with their throats torn open or necks broken.  Local authorities warned citizens not to venture outside after dark.  The incidents stopped after a three week period.  The witness had seen a media report listed on the BFRO website regarding pet deaths and sasquatch sightings in Tennessee that sounded very similar to the local occurrences.I found the witness to be very credible.  Readers may note that the originally submitted report is somewhat abbreviated and merges some of the details that were later elicited in the interview.  Given the number of years that have passed, I do not find this to be problematic.",
