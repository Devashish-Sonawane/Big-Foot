            "Follow-Up Report": "I was able to speak directly with three of the witnesses involved in the incident reported. The witnesses described how they were camping on land belonging to one of the families. They had never experienced anything remotely close to what they experienced that night. While two of the witnesses left the area, two of the four stayed behind and began working on erecting a tent. It was then that they first began hearing strange sounds and began smelling a rancid odor (which persisted through much of the night). Keep in mind that these young men all grew up in the vicinity and were well used to all the sounds of the forest. These sounds were uniquely peculiar in that they sounded almost human-like. The witnesses \u0093heard something like a person\u0094 20 \u0096 30 yards away just after the sun had gone down. What they were hearing was similar to the sounds of \"someone walking around.\" It was now \u0093pitch dark.\u0094 A campfire was burning and flashlights and ATV lights were in use. The sounds began to evoke images of someone \u0093stomping around or jumping.\u0094 The two young men now found themselves getting \u0093spooked.\u0094 Whatever it was, it remained just out of sight and across the creek. Then, the two began hearing \u0093deep growls.\u0094 The young men's dog, a cocker spaniel, was decidedly uncomfortable with the disquieting visitor. The witnesses remarked that the dog was extremely nervous, whiney and afraid through out the evening. When the other two witnesses arrived back on the scene, the sounds seemingly stopped. A while later, the sounds (\u0093stomping, jumping, and growling\u0094) resumed, this time all four of the young men heard them. The sounds continued for approximately 15 minutes, then the unseen entity sounded as though it jumped into the creek and began approaching the young men. At that time, the witnesses, already scared, now became defensive and began shouting (still thinking \u0096 indeed hoping it to be human) at the intruder, ordering it to not come any closer. The primary witness indicated that at that time he picked up a large rock and threw it toward the unknown and unseen harasser. The stone must have hit its target or came very close, because the unidentified tormentor shrieked and hysterically ran around the campsite, the whole time the young men hearing its loud panting and breathing. Once it stopped, the witnesses decided to end the stand off and defiantly began to approach the creature. The animal then produced a scream that \u0093sounded like a woman but much more high-pitched.\u0094 The primary witness stated that the scream was so loud that it actually made his \u0093ears hurt.\u0094 The witnesses immediately left to retrieve one of their fathers.When the witnesses returned, all activity had ceased. The father witnessed nothing of the sort that the young men had witnessed and casually dismissed the incident. The young men were still not sure of what they had encountered. The father managed to calm the young men down, and they reluctantly decided to stay the rest of the night at the campsite. I asked the witnesses why they would choose to return and stay there after having endured such a harrowing experience. The said they all lived there and knew the woods well, and that the animal could have been anything, and they believed that the game of torment was over. Into the night, the primary witness awoke to more noises, but he chose to try to ignore the sounds. He remained awake until the sun came up. When the other young men awoke the next morning, they combed the area for indications of what had tormented them during the night. The witnesses found large humanlike footprints \u009315 \u0096 16 inches in length with five toes,\u0094 and an area where something large had created a nest with a crude, rudimentary roof of tree branches. Also in the area around the nest, they found dark hairs. Apparently they began to hear noises again, and the primary witness \u0093crept\u0094 up a small hill and peered over it, only to see a \u0093large, hairy animal\u0094 with its back facing him. The animal was at a distance of 30 \u0096 40 yards. It turned once and looked at the witness and then ran off. The witness described the creature as being \u0093dark brown,\u0094 and \u0093around seven feet tall,\u0094 with a face that \u0093looked like a gorilla.\u0094 At that time, the witness thought to himself, \u0093So this is what a bigfoot looks like.\u0094  The father came to the campsite and inspected the area. He listened to the testimony of the primary witness and looked at the tracks. He then told the young men that he believed they had been harassed by a bigfoot. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This report was close to Lake Dorr.  The location:The driver was heading south on SR-19. His wife was sleeping in the passenger seat and another couple were sleeping in the camper shell in the back of the truck. It was near midnight and they were returning from a fishing trip. He believes he was going about 70 mph, and had his bright headlights on. There wasn\u0092t much traffic.The driver noticed movement to the right of the road near a power pole. He saw a tall, bipedal creature come from the woods, moving toward the street. It was about 5 yards off the road when it turned to its right away from the car and returned into the woods. The driver slammed on the brakes waking everyone in the truck. He explained what he had just seen and none of his passengers wanted to get out of the truck to look further.The man described the biped as 8 or 9 feet fall and very thin, almost as if it was malnourished. It had short hair, about two inches long, that appeared to be shorter than a bear\u0092s fur and it was \u0093orangey - yellow like a Labrador Retriever\u0094 in color. The head was rounded, it had no neck and the face he saw looked \u0093more like an orangutan than anything else.\u0094 It had big dark eyes, and its nose \u0093didn\u0092t look human, but more like a gorilla's.\u0094  The sighting was just north of Ravenswood Road, across from Dorr Road. An old railroad grade coming out of the Ocala National Forest ends near Dorr Road. The railroad grade is still clear cut and allows travel in the same way a power-line road would. The BFRO has several reports from this area:Report #1480Report #5510 Report #12903 Report #14100 Report #27778BFRO Florida 2006 Expedition Report",
