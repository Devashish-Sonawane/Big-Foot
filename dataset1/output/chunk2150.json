We pulled off of I-25 Southbound into the gas station parking lot.  When we were driving down the frontage road towards the gas station, we saw a few vehicles on the far end of the parking lot with 3-4 people talking and a NM State Police cruiser was leaving the lot, however, upon parking in front of the gas station, we discovered that it was closed.  I needed to pee rather urgently, so I ran around to the back of the station to find a dark place to do my business.  I walked about 15-20 meters behind the gas station to be out of sight of the occupied vehicles in the gas station lot.  As I was urinating I began to feel...uncomfortable.  I was peeing in open ground and initially thought somebody was walking up behind me (probably to do the same thing).  I craned a looked around and saw nobody and no animals; just a blanket feeling that somebody was very near me.  As I finished peeing, I turned and began briskly walking back towards our vehicle.  As I was hurrying back I turned to look behind me; and that is when I became a believer.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I had the privilege of speaking on the phone and exchanging multiple emails with this witness. He reiterated his fear and wonderment of this early morning encounter. He mentioned that he is a highly credentialed scientist in the medical field. Having a scientific background, the witness finds this personal encounter challenges the rational concept that these animals don't exist per current scientific knowledge. He has a lot of trouble admitting this animal exists, but now must admit it. The witness has returned to the location during the daylight and provided some photos of the area. The area is very open. The witness now realizes that as he urinated the animal was out in the open and crouched down very close by. After daytime viewing of the area the witness also would like to revise his estimate of the animal's height to the 7 to 8 foot range. Further details were brought forth by the witness during our discussion. He remembers the area smelling like cat urine. The witness says it reminded him of a mountain lion's urine, a smell that he is familiar with in the past. Also shared, as the witness walked back toward his car he looked back over his shoulder and observed this animal rise up and move off. In his estimation the animal weighed 500 to 600 pounds. The hair was matted and dirty looking. It had long arms and human shaped hands. He noted that the animals hands were dinner plate in size. The animal used its arms for momentum as part of its rapid, fluid, swift stride. The witness describes the animals movement as graceful, clean and flowing with no head movement. The witness mentioned that he was armed at the time and felt that he was still overpowered as well as dumbfounded by what he was seeing. He commented that he felt the animal was annoyed by his presence. He also told me that he thought the animal was watching the activity of the other people in the area when approached accidentally by the witness.I looked at this gas station on Google Earth and determined that it also is a Subway sandwich shop. There is a dumpster in the area of this sighting. This could be a food source for this large animal? The Gallinas River is two miles east and the Santa Fe National Forest is directly to the west and north.   I find the witness to be highly educated and sincere in all his statements. I'm glad the witness chose to share his remarkable experience with BFRO.",
