            "Observed": "In 2009 during the riffle buck (deer) season I was hunting in Slaughters Creek, Kanawha County, West Virginia out on a mining/logging rd when I saw what I thought to be a bear until I got about 80 yrds from the creature it was upright around 7 1/2 ft tall & looked like a linebacker, huge there was a stench in the air like a combination of wet dog & body odor as I walked up the road. I must have stepped on a twig or it caught my scent it turned sharply made a grunt noise then in about 3 steps was up a hillside that would have taken myself 20-25 steps to go up. It went over the ridge and disappeared into the woods. My eyes were watering from fear, my body was shaking I had a 30-06 rifle on me yet I didn't feel like I could have shot. I think I scared it as much as it scared me.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to this witness at length about his encounter. He is bright, well spoken and makes a living as an electrician. He was hunting along an old logging road. It was overgrown with trees. He heard a noise which he assumed to be a deer coming and he raised his gun to wait for it. He saw an arm in his scope as the animal raised itself up onto the road that he was on.The witness and animal then made eye contact without the animal slowing down at all. The witness noted the nose being human-like but flatter. Dark skin around the eyes and nose similar in color to a dog's nose. He also noted wrinkles around the eyes. The hair color was reddish brown.As with many West Virginia areas, the terrain is ideal and hospitable for a large omnivorous animal.",

            "Observed": "I was about 5 years old at the time. It was summer and the door was left open and the screen door closed. My grandfather had been in a wreck and his head had been in traction. He was laying on the couch fold out bed asleep. My grandmother and mother were in the other room with a friend playing a game of cards and I was playing with toys and watching The Price is Right (didn't have any choice - too small to change the channel) on tv. When I looked toward the door there was a 4 foot thing covered in a ruddy reddish brown fur. He was wide across the shoulders, sort of flat face watching me play with my toys. I walked up the the screen and we watched each other for a while. Its eyes almost like it was curious me like I was of it. I walked into the other room and to get my grandmother to show her this thing at the front door. But when she came it was gone. I never felt afraid of it nor did it act aggressive just curious about me or my toys. They pretty much discounted it as a child trying to get attention but to this day I can still see it in my mind every detail. And the following morning I took the toy outside and left it for the furry being. Never saw that toy again. Years later after I had gotten older I looked into native america lore and looked at information on sasquatches and put together I had seen a child. After listening to Coast to Coast I decided it was time to say something that I wasn't alone in seeing something like this.",
