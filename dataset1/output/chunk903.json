            "Observed": "Me and my neighbor were sitting in a hunting blind for about 2 1/2 hours when the woods suddenly went quiet. Then we heard some crashing in the bushes about 300 yards away. So I told my neighbor to put on his walker game ear headphones. I thought it was pigs and was curious to see if he could pinpoint where they were but the crashing got louder and he said the foot steps sounded like a man's gait, 2 legs then all the sudden a big boom and then the loudest and creepiest howl I ever heard nothing like a man or animal I've ever heard. So we sat till after dark hoping to see it then we packed up and began walking back to the boat, we got about 200 yards down the dirt road we were walking and I decided to turn around and 50 yards behind me is the glint of eyes about 7 feet off the ground, and it turned away and ran.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The two hunters went to a secluded spot off the St. Johns River were they have successfully hunted deer before. The hunter didn't want the location given out, but I have included a satellite photo of the area so you can see how remote it is:The men de-scented before leaving. They took a boat to the location at sunrise, set up their blind, walked several miles and returned to the blind around 2 PM.   They baited the area with buck urine.  When they returned they hunkered down and used deer calls.  After a while they heard movement coming from the east by a line of oaks. One of the men eager to use his new parabolic ear, listened in. He clearly heard bipedal steps and motioned to his friend as much. The two watched the area expecting to see another hunter emerge. Suddenly there was a crash sounding like a large tree branch breaking, then a loud deep howl. They both commented that they have never heard a coyote sound like that, and they both agreed that whatever it was, it sounded angry.  After the howl, they listened but were unable to hear it walk away.  It was about six minutes before the insects and birds began making noise again.It was getting dark and they left about 45 minutes later.  As they headed down the game trail towards the boat one of the hunters turned around; he felt he was being followed. He saw a flash of white eye shine about 60 yards behind him. He described it \u0093as if someone was standing on a bike wearing a head lamp.\u0094  They stood there waiting several moments to see if anyone was coming down the trail. No one did.The bipedal steps and howl came from upwind of the men.  It is possible that the sasquatch heard their deer calls, smelled the deer urine and came to investigate, only to discover that it was hunters and not deer.  It may have gotten angry, and acted out trying to intimidate them. It should also be noted that the men always see deer at this location, and on this day they did not see one.The area is very close to the location of report #33789.The location is assessable only by boat and a field investigation has been scheduled. If any evidence pertaining to this report is found it will be added at a later date.",
