We both went off to the left side of the trail and were still walking side by side. As we were walking, we were startled when a figure jumped out of a tree no more then 20-30 feet in front of us in the direction we were headed. The figure landed facing us on 2 feet and was very obvious it was like nothing we had ever seen before. I do not believe it was an adult due to the fact it was only about 5 ft. tall. It had brown hair all over its body and just stared at us. After about 5 seconds or so we freaked out and ran for our bikes and took off. We saw this thing in broad daylight at a close range. I think it may have thought we saw him and we were approaching him and that's why he jumped? We had no clue it was there till he made the leap.",

The animal that jumped out of the tree, jumped when the witness and his friend were walking towards the tree.  They did not see the animal until it landed on the ground, and stood less than 5 ft. tall.  The animal had brown hair with a hint of red, couple inches long.  Witness does not remember additional detail.They stood looking at the animal for about five to ten seconds.  The animal did the same thing and looked at them.  They started their mini bikes and quickly left the area.  They did not look back.  Repeated attempts to speak to the second witness have been unsuccessful because he is currently stationed in Afghanistan. Once I have a chance to speak to this second witness this report will be updated.There is a thicket close by and berry bushes along the trail.  Many trails dissect the area, people would walk the trails, often with their dogs.    There is a quarry to the south.  Bass Lake is to the southeast.  Nearby Lake Aquilla is the head water of the Cuyahoga River.  There have been numerous sightings reported along the river in Geauga, Summit and Cuyahoga counties.  The area has orchards and small farms.  ",
