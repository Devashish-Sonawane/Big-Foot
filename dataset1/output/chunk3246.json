            "Observed": "My dad and I used to bowhunt deer on a lease that was in Rusk County in East Texas.One end of the property was bordered by the Angelina River.This was good deer habitat as there was abundant food and lots of thick cover.The rest of the hunting lease was covered with a thick forest of pine trees. Late one September afternoon we were scouting the river bottom area for good locations for tree stands. There was an eerie stillness in the bottomland that day, and I had an unsettling feeling that I was being watched. A lot of people have said that they \"felt as if they were being watched,\" but that's probably the best way to describe this vague feeling of anxiety. It was at dusk when we heard it: a blood curdling scream that echoed across the river",
