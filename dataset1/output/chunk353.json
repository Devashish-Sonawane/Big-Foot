            "Observed": "In the fall of 1981. My next door neighbor and myself, were walking down a dirt road in Casselberry. The road runs along side of a wooded tract of land. The land has been reserved for a bird sancturary. Anyway, this road runs behind some homes all the way down to South Seminole middle school. On this evening we were walking to the school for a dance in the gym. It was about 9 p.m.. We were about 50 or 60 yards from the end of the road, where a large opening sits. I had briefly stopped to tie my shoe. Suddenly, we heard crashing sounds, like footsteps only louder. There were 5 or 6 steps, and as we turned to look at what was making the noise, two trees parted as if giant hands were just brushing them aside. Sadly, we were both too scared to stay around any longer. We ran all the way around S.S.M.S. and around the Elementary school. Cut through the catwalk. And, ran the rest of the way home. Several weeks later my mother reported hearing loud noises outside of our house. We owned one of the homes that sat next to this woods. She had said she had been awoken by our pitbull, staring into the woods, barking. She said she had heard these large sounds, almost like foot steps, except she said that they covered far too much ground. She said she had heard four or five steps then the sound of wood breaking. And then a large thrashing sound as though it were shaking large bushes together. The next day my mother, myself and our neighbors went out into the woods to investigate. We found a large branch approximately 10 inches around. Had been torn from a tree. And I do mean torn, this wasn't a cut or a branch that had been struck by lightning. This had been ripped from the tree. Anyway, we lived there for several more years, and although my friends and I spent a whole lot of our summer days and nights searching those woods for some kind of proof. None was ever found by us. I have been wondering for a long time if anyone in that area has exp. the same thing.",
