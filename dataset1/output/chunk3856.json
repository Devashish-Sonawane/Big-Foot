He was riding in our car, and when we got to Beacon Rock, he said to slow down. The place where he saw Bigfoot was not too far ahead. He related the following:",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness, spoke to him and found him to be credible. He had the following to add:\"I was driving southbound down route 11 through Columbiana County heading to Mountaineer casino.  The actual city was Leetonia.   The weather was sunny blue sky about 72 degrees.  Traffic was extremely light and I was cruisin my sports sedan lookin for an opportunity to open it up.  The road there is very straight and slightly downhill.  I put my foot on it and immediately focused on the road ahead lookin for patrol officers. When all of a sudden, a little over an eighth of a mile away I saw this tall golden brown figure crossing the road on the other side away from me as I approached.  It was definitely walking upright and it crossed from the median to over the guardrail in just a few large strides.  It had long arms that were swinging in sync with its stride.  Really smoothly, not bouncy like deer. Once I got close enough it was gone.  Definitely not a deer or bear.  I returned to the scene on my way home the next day and stopped to look for tracks or what not and did not feel like climbing down the side to investigate in the river.  The area I viewed all this is a small overpass where a little stream or river crosses under the road. \"This area of Columbiana County has several farm fields, deer, orchards, and water sources.",
