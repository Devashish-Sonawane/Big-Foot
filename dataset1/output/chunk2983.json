            "Observed": "I was elk hunting alone and was having a hard time going to sleep so I was just laying in my bag at about 10:30 pm. Initially I heard what sounded like something clearing its throat but it was a very deep sound that was like nothing I've ever heard. 20 minutes later I heard what sounded like a rock land close to my tent and a few seconds later I heard another one land with a thud, neither sounded as if they rolled as the ground was damp from snow melt. Just after 11 pm I heard something come from the tree line behind me \"wooooo\" \"wooooo\" from two separate locations as if there were several and they were talking to each other. Once the sun came up enough for me to see I broke camp and left and didn't look around for sign as I was a bit unnerved by the whole thing.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke at length with the witness on the phone.  He spoke clearly and with great detail about the encounter.  The events occurred during the witness' third night at the campsite, which was about 3 miles from the hunting area that he was utilizing.  There was a sliver of moon the night of the encounter, and it was very dark.The witness mentioned that there was a free-range cattle grazing area close to his camp, and on the night of his encounter, the cows seemed unusually quiet, and were grouped together in one section of the grazing area.  During the previous two nights, the cows were noisy and ventured close to his campsite throughout the night.He had gone to bed around 10pm, and at @10:30pm, he heard a loud bark or cough in the tree-line near his camp.About 20 mts. later, two large rocks were heaved into his camp, both of which made very loud thuds when they landed.Shortly after that, he heard loud whoops from three different directions around the camp.  The witness stated that he then armed himself in his tent, and he mentioned that if he was not already situated in his tent, he would have packed up his belongings and left the area at that point.  No other activities occurred that night.The witness seemed very sincere, and his descriptions of the events were clear and did not deviate in any way during our discussion.The area where the encounter took place is near several other locations where Bigfoot activity has been reported and documented.",
