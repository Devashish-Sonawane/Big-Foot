            "Follow-Up Report": "The author of the report and person I spoke to, \"K,\" was seventeen at the time of his and his friend's sighting.  He described the experience to me very well and impressed me as an experienced outdoorsman. Although he now lives on the west coast, he grew up near the area of the sighting - the north shore of Lake Superior - and knows the animals of the north woods. He spoke about timber wolves knowledgably, as someone who has encountered them with some frequency while hunting and fishing in that country.The vocalizations the young men heard were completely unlike anything they had heard before. They seemed to have been made by a really large animal \"It had big volume with depth, a lot of base... resonance,\" he said \"And the sound was directed at us... seemed to be saying, 'Get out!'\"  K said the vocalizations began with a howl that was low in the beginning and ended on a higher note, and had a duration of what sounded to be five to ten seconds.At the end of the howl came two \"grunts\" that K found hard to describe or mimic, although his attempts to mimic them made them seem more complex than what I would term a \"grunt.\" I suggested, \"growl\" and he didn't think that was quite the right descriptor either.  He said, \"I hate to say it, but the grunts had a monkey quality to them.\" In any case, the \"grunt\" noise K tried to reproduce for me was not just a one syllable sound. He said that the howl portion of the vocalization was always just a single howl and that the recording on the BFRO website made in Columbiana County, Ohio by Matt Moneymaker, was \"not quite right,\" but came closest to matching the howl he heard. It was \"very basey... with weight behind it.\"That vocalization, which was repeated several times, was frightening to the two young men because it seemed to be way out of bounds for the animals of the north woods, animals they both knew well, including timber wolves and their howls. This sound was completely and obviously different and they both felt intimidated immediately upon hearing it. K and his friend decided right away to turn around and leave the area. After traveling several hundred yards back to the trail leading out of the area, both K and his friend simultaneously felt as though they were being watched. His friend looked at K in a way that said, \"Did you hear that? Do you feel that?\" As they backtracked out of there they heard the movements of a large animal as it paralleled them. \"That's when we started paying attention to the movement tracking us,\" K said. They became even more unnerved when they found that, upon stopping to listen to it, it stopped too, apparently in an effort not to be heard.When the young men came to a clearing, a marshy area relatively free of trees but mucky and hard going, they knew it would provide a view of the animal. They watched, \"expecting to see a bear\" emerge, and were shocked to instead see a large, upright walking animal... (a bigfoot!). K didn't say the word \"bigfoot,\" but it was clear from his description that that is what he and his friend thought they were looking at. \"It was not a bear, and it definitely was not human,\" he said. Among the first impressions K had upon seeing the animal, were that \"its body language was not threatening... more inquisitive... which was a relief.\" And the animal moved extraordinarily quickly across that opening, through that terrible terrain, \"faster than I could have run that distance wearing track shoes.\" K came back to this point several times - the graceful speed of the creature as it moved fast, \"seemingly at a leisurely pace,\" across that difficult swampland. \"I could not walk across that swamp, even today, without great effort. I would sink in to my knees on every step,\" he said.K thought the animal looked at them when it crossed the clearing. He could not see its face, though, since the animal was backlit by the setting sun. \"It's possible it was actually looking away from us,\" K said, \"but I really think it was looking at us.\" K said the animal was \"covered in hair, like a bear.\" When I asked why he used the word \"hair\" instead of \"fur,\" K said he didn't know. \"The head was sort of conical shaped, but it didn't have a distinct point.\" He added that it had broad shoulders, its torso was bent forward, and it had arms that were too long (compared to a human). And, he said, it seemed to have no neck.When I asked him what he would say to me, a person who grapples with the idea of absolutely believing in sasquatch, he said the same thing another witness said to me recently when asked that: \"I know what I saw. I know it's real.\" (My report on that other sighting - the one in which the witness used that phrase - has not been published at the time of this writing. It will be published in September.) He then expanded upon that adding, \"Actually, I don't care what you think, and I don't  care what you say. I have witnessed it with my own eyes. Bigfoot is real.\" K went on to say that the experience has changed his life. He said he had felt quite competent, very skilled even, in the woods, but the way the animal behaved and dealt with them that day, \"made me feel like a kindergartener.\"It's interesting that, at first, the behavior of the animal seems to be about making the young men leave an area. The vocalizations seemed to say, \"I am here, and I am bad, get out!\" But then, after the guys left - were leaving... the animal sought to conceal the fact that it was shadowing them. It was careful to stop when they did, seemingly to avoid detection. So, you have apparent intimidation followed by an apparent attempt at concealment. Those two behaviors seem to be at odds with one another. K said, \"The way I look at it, the creature warned us and then discreetly escorted us out. That's how I felt.\"I am attempting to arrange an interview with this witness's friend.",

            "Observed": "It was summer in the mid 80's. (Sorry I can't be more specific.) Some friends and I had taken to exploring the woods that surrounded our town. We were constantly in the woods for one reason or another. On this particular morning, I think it was around 0900, only one of my friends was able to accompany me into the woods. We followed our normal trail to the rim of Curry Hollow, which was about 400yds into the woods. We strung some ropes, and went down the incline. It was steep enough that the ropes were necessary. When we got to the floor of the hollow we started walking through a section of woods that we hadn\u0092t checked out yet. Mostly we were just wandering, and seeing what was in the area. At that time of my life I had a started developing an interest in the outdoors and wildlife, so whenever we were in the woods I tried to make sure we were quiet enough not to scare away any animals. We all enjoyed trying to track the different species in the area. In our wanderings we had found raccoon dens, snake and bird nests and even tracked a few deer through the trees and brush so when we saw the animal stand up in front of us we knew instantly that this was something different. We were coming up on a deadfall that had been covered over with vines and surrounded by small saplings since it had fallen. We started to go around the fallen tree (it was approx. 80 to 100 feet long and 2 \u00bd feet wide and the crown caused it to be about three to four feet off the ground) and had made it to the base when we both spotted a humped shape covered with brown hair or fur. The shape was about 10 feet in front of us and was close to a tangle of vines and brush. We both froze and just stared. We had both been told that though they were rare in the area, some people had seen bear in and around these woods. And that\u0092s what we thought it was, and we knew we were to close. Thinking it might be injured since was so still, I decided we should go home and let my father know a local cop know about it. I glanced to my friend and motioned to him that we should go back the way we came. We had just started to turn when the shaped stood up and took off running. When it stood, we saw was that it was at least 2 feet taller than us. At the time we were both around 5\u0092 5\u0094. When it started running was when I got scared, it was on two legs. It cleared a good 20yds through the brush in what seemed like a split second. We instantly took off the other way and didn\u0092t stop until we had made it up the rope and out of the woods. We didn't discuss it at the time. Later that week we talked and told some friends, and few days later we went back to the area with 3 more people. We found the tangle of brush the figure was behind and saw a large clear space, the size of which a small family of deer would have made, but there were no tracks, neither foot-prints or hoof-prints. The ground cover was a thick mat of leaves over the entire area. We noticed nothing else out of the ordinary.",
