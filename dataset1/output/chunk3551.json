            "Observed": "I didn't actually see anything. My wife woke me up around 1:30 am. She was giving me a hard time for the smell in the cabin (she thought I was passing gas). I told her it wasn't me. I had the window open and the fan was on blowing the cold air on me. There was this stench coming from outside. It was the most horrible smell I have ever smelled in my  life. It was a mix of nasty fecal matter (diarrhea) and body sweat/odor. I immediately shut the fan off and the smell started to go away. I didn't even think about going outside until later on in the morning about 10:00 am when we were eating breakfast.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.The two nearest cabins are thirty-five and 100 yards away. Those cabins were empty that night. These cabins are on Boise National Forest property. The foul odor that awoke his wife was so strong, it lingered in the cabin for at least ten minutes after the witness closed the window and turned the fan off. The next morning, his eight year old son volunteered what he experienced. The son awoke five different times. On the fifth time, he saw an outline of a head outside the window. He then went over to where the daughters were sleeping. The witness is six feet one inch tall and the bottom of the window is above that. Nobody heard anything hit the cabin, or any vocalizations. The dog was not restless and just slept.His son will sometimes practice whoops outside, but the witness cannot remember if his son did any the day before. I found the witness to be credible.   ",
