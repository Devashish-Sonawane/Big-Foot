            "Observed": "I live in a retirement community known as Fairfield Glade on the Cumberland Plateau in East Tennessee. Knoxville is the nearest large city and is 65 miles east.  Our little community is surrounded on almost three sides by a state forest and the Catoosa Wildlife Refuge.  We have an over abundance of \"protected\" wildlife of all kinds (including too many deer, in my opinion) that venture, at will, into our community.  Always the bold tomboy, I preferred to get my exercise by hiking the heavily forested back roads and trails near our home instead of playing golf as my husband did.  I never hiked more than 6 miles from home, and always in the early morning.  One morning, I was approximately 4 miles from my home when I came upon an unexpected sunny clearing that seemed to have been an old road or path at one time because it was grassy and void of underbrush or trees.  On my hikes I am normally under a full canopy of very tall trees.  So the sunlight was an unexpected pleasure.  As I rounded a curve and my eyes caught the filtered sunlight from the clearing, I observed a large ape-like creature jump from the woods and pounce at something on the ground.  I abruptly froze.  In a flash, the creature stood back up holding a long snake by the head.  Just as quick as this happened, the creature disappeared back into the cover of the woods alongside the clearing.  I remained still for a moment contemplating whether the animal had seen me and how best to protect myself.  I literally heard my heart beating.  I quickly ruled out tree climbing and decided the only alternative was to turn in the opposite direction and run as fast as my legs would carry me. I ran nearly all the way home.  I was so disturbed by what I had seen, I decided that no one would believe it, so I never told anyone.  That was about 5 or 6 years ago, and my husband has since died. Over the years, I have tried to convince myself that I really didn't see the thing that has so frightened me that morning in the woods.  I tried to convince myself that I had somehow imagined it; however, the vivid memory persists.  To this day, I have never set foot in any woods again, essentially breaking a very longstanding and much revered habit that day.  I am still fearful of seeing that creature again.  I have always been a sober-minded individual, not at all given to making up fantasies or stretching the truth as I know it.  I was completely caught off guard and stunned the other day when an ad spot for your show came across my TV screen.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted this witness and found her to be very credible.  She has a professional business background, and is also a professional photographer.  I have the following to add from our conversation: The area where her sighting occurred was on an old trail wide enough for one vehicle.  The creature was described as having brown/black hair, approximately 2-3 inches in length, which appeared muddy and unkempt.  The head did seem to be larger in the back than the front sloping forehead, and the neck was very short.  The one cheek she could see appeared \u0093fat\u0094 and the skin a black/charcoal color in the sunlight.  She only noticed one side of the head.  The animal was estimated to be six feet in height and was viewed at a distance of around 100 feet.  It was very agile as it jumped out and grabbed the snake.  The animal appeared \u0093solid\u0094 with equal girth between shoulders, chest, and body. This sighting occurred south of the Catoosa Wildlife Management area, in middle/north TN.  This area has 80,000 acres of protected land with numerous creeks, gorges, and abundant wildlife.   The close proximity to Fairfield Glade allows these animals to wander freely in this developing community, providing a large local population of deer, turkey, and other wild animals.   This entire area, overall, has the essentials for providing a prime sasquatch habitat.This is a local topographic map of the area, with the red \"x\" marking the approximate location of the sighting.",

            "Observed": "I was driving a VW bus so I had a good view of my surroundings. As I rounded the first corner of the exit I noticed what I thought was a big white dog, like an Afghan running on all fours toward the road, up an embankment. We both reached the same point at the same time and I thought I would hit the dog. It seemed it didn't notice my car until it reached the side of the road when it was only feet away from the car. I don't remember slowing much but I wasn't going very fast to start with as the curve was pretty tight. As the creature reached the road and I saw it, it stood up on it's back legs. It was covered with long white hair maybe 8 inches long, it wasn't thick but more stringy and dirty looking and it had a round head, not a dog.  I passed the creature and didn't catch it in my mirrors as it was dark. It scared me.I didn't get much detail of it's face but I did notice a fairly large mouth or lips which were prominent. The head was not huge and the body was pretty slender, it was probably as tall as the VW when it stood up, over 6 feet.",

After an extensive interview with the witness the following additions can be added to his report. \u0095The van\u0092s lights stayed on the creature for an extended amount of time because of the left hand curve in the road.\u0095The creature was loping uphill, on all fours, with an awkward gallop from right to left.  When the creature reached the road\u0092s edge, it stood up and was a hominoid close to 7 feet tall.  It had long arms and was only a few feet away from the witness.\u0095It was huge with the upper body smaller in comparison to the huge hips/legs. ",
