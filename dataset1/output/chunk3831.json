As we were walking up in the timber we kept hearing things behind us.  I knew it was big because of the noises we were hearing.  We would walk and it would start walking and it would stop whenever we did.  I never saw it but we knew it was there.",

As soon as I shot the deer, it just went crazy. We could see the trees shaking and going down, and them suckers were moving. It started making this godawful noise, like a big bird, a chirping noise. The deer ran off to the right, we followed the blood trail down the hill and this thing came after us. We knew it was behind us, but I still couldn't see it. So I told my wife, \"Let's get out of here because I don't know what this thing is but I think we're going to get in trouble here and all I got is this bow and arrow.''As we left, it followed us, still making this godawful noise. It came all the way to the edge of the timber, still howling and screaming. I've lived in Alaska, I've hunted all my life: brown bears, grizz... I've hunted all over the world and to this day, I've never seen anything like it. A deer or bear ain't going to move those big quakies around.''",
