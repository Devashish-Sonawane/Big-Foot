            "Observed": "It was in 1977 and it was late summer or early fall.  I was about 6 or 7 years old and my younger sister and I were looking out our living room window and saw a big hairy ape-like creature walking upright. It walked across our yard and into the woods.  It looked like it came across the road from the angle it was walking but we didn't see it cross.  We didn't see until it was almost to the side of the house, it was only about 100 feet away from us and we got a good look at it.  I still live in the same house where this happened.  It was dusk but still bright enough outside to see well.  It looked right at us and of course it scared us at the time.  We told our mom but she didn't believe us, but to calm us she told us to hide in the bathroom. So we did.  It's hair was a dark redish brown but the red tint could of been from the sun going down. It was about 6'6\" or so, tall, stocky, broad shouldered, hairy, and naked.  It was not human, it had way too much hair for that.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness via telephone and the following details can be added to the report.  The animal the witnesses observed walking across the yard was bipedal and approximately 6 1/2 feet tall.  The speed of its walk appeared to be casual and not hurried.  While it was crossing the yard, it looked toward the witnesses and they felt that it knew of their presence. It then continued between the house and convenience store toward the road.  The witness stated that the hair appeared brown on the animal, but the hair that was hanging down along the arms and the outline of the body appeared reddish in the setting sun.  The witness added that many stories of sightings occur in this region.  When the subject of bigfoot/sasquatch comes up in conversation, no one seems too surprised and freely talks about the subject.",
