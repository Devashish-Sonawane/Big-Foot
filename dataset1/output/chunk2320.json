            "Observed": "I am an avid outdoorsman and bow hunter in southern Illinois. I have hunted all over the U.S. seeing many animals and all kinds of terrain, but this day was not like any other I have ever had. I was heading to some public land that adjoins to the river to river trail. I drove between two orchard fields to get there I have hunted this spot many times I have seen numerous mountain lions, bobcats coyotes etc. in this location. I unloaded my gear and set off to a part of the public land rarely visited by people. If not for me I doubt anyone would ever go back to the spot. It was right around 1130 am I had been walking approximately 30-45 mins into the woods. I came to around 900 yards from my spot, it was pretty open the leaves had fallen off the trees and I could see a good distance. I started walking and I heard a snap of a branch other then mine. I believed it to be a deer so I stopped behind a big white oak tree in which I was behind and leaned against it. I went to peer around it and I couldn't believe my eyes, it's like nothing I have ever seen before. I was approximately 78 yards away according to my range finder I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me as to what I had seen it was gray with a slight bit of tan and brown mixed into its coat. It looked to be around 4 n a half to 5 feet tall. It did stand on two legs. But I believe it smelled me when the wind picked up and blew towards it an it dropped very, very low to the ground. lower then a bear could go and I ducked back behind the tree. When I looked back from behind the tree it was gone. I believe it was a baby Bigfoot as I have heard rumor and stories of this public land from countless people and friends of being chased up trees, rocks thrown at them, and their stands being ripped to shreds.",
