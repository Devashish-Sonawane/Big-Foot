My name is Robert. After work, I picked up the new kid in my class, Mike, and my best friend, Al, bought a 6 pack, and drove out to the lake roads. We drove north off of highway 199 and through the Nature Center to where we fished, called the bend in the river. Mike and I got out and were putting the batteries in the flashlights, while Al was in the truck with the music loud. We were talking in back of the truck watching the river running by and shining the flashlights. It was cold.",

I talked to him, and he said he saw it 2 times. The first time, 6 people in the car saw it standing with its arms over its head. Someone said \"look at that dumby in the road\", and as they got closer, it was panic in the car. Three girls and 3 guys, all at the same time, seeing it. He said it was huge, massive. The headlights showed huge pec muscles and arms. He spun the car around and left. No girls went along the next few times. The next time he saw it, it was running through an area where the asphalt turned to dirt road. I knew where he was talking about. It was thought it was heading to the woods. Then it turned and was after the car. They were they all screaming as they left it in the dust. Oh, they had guns,but were so surprized and scared,they had no thought to use  them.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by telephone. The entire incident lasted only a few seconds. He heard 3 extremely loud vocalizations, each lasting about 3 seconds in duration with a pause in between. The vocals went from a high to low pitch. Within 15 seconds of the first vocalization, all three boys were in the truck and leaving. He added that the vocalizations came from the woods behind them and were so loud that it was difficult to estimate the distance to the origin. The sounds were like nothing he had heard before or since.I visited the Fort Worth Nature Center where the incident occurred and hiked several of the trails within the Center. In addition to the hills and woods, part of the center is a swamp connected to Lake Worth containing tall reeds and mud that makes the swamp nearly impenetrable by hikers. During my late morning hikes, I saw several deer, squirrels, lizards, fish, turtles, and water birds.This location is where the highly documented sightings of the Lake Worth Monster occurred from the late 1960's to the mid 1970\u0092s. See recent Lake Worth Monster Revisited article at Cryptomundo. I found the witness to be forthright and credible about his experience.",
