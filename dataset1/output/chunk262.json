            "Observed": "I was out riding my bike and came to the logging road and started walking because you don't ride bikes where cougars dwell.  So I hiked for a while enjoying the sights and the trail forks in a y-shape and I took a left and walked up the hill.  After I got to the top of the hill I walked down a little further and at my 2 o'clock I heard a large branch snap like how a twig snaps under a man's foot and the brush crashed and I heard what sounded like a baseball bat hit a tree.  When I looked at where the noise came from and I saw to my horror a rock come towards me from out of the bushes and my eyes caught the hand throwing the rock, and when I noticed the hand I saw it jump in the air and do a 180 spin so it would be faced away from me when it landed and I swear to god it threw the rock so freakin hard that the entire rock didn't spin at all when it was being chucked.  It bonked the stump on the side of the trail and I kept staring at it because I thought at first it was a ghost or mabye somebody behind the stump that I just saw do a ninja move. Then I realized that it was facing away from me towards the swampy brush because the stump I was looking had a muscley buttocks and I could see on the top of the stump what looked like a v shape tuft of hair similar to Howard the Duck.  I was yellin and shoutin at it but it just stood their and kept looking away from me, and I knew that this thing is not going to move unless I go over there and at that point I left the forest by going back where I came from.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone, and he no longer lives in the area which is on the Tulalip Indian Reservation, just west of Marysville, Washington.He seemed very credible as he related all the details of his report.  He has been doing martial arts since he was a child and is used to watching fast hand motions, he believes that is how he was able to spot the hand that threw the softball-sized rock.Additional information:- The creature appeared to be approximately 6 feet tall.- The creature was dark brown in color.- The creature's hair was sticking up in a v-shape like it was having a \"bad-hair\" day.- The creature was very muscular; with exceptionally muscular legs.- The witness could not see any facial details of the creature as it was facing away from him.- The witness was startled, then felt very scared, and then left the area.It is highly probable that the witness had an encounter with a rock-throwing sasquatch.The picture below shows where the rock was thrown from.  It was thrown from from behind the evergreen tree limbs in the middle of the frame and hit the small stump next to the road in the foreground of the frame.The picture below shows the road from the vantage point of the creature that threw the rock at the witness.The Tulalip Reservation has a history of sasquatch sightings, including the report listed below.Report # 28959.Tulalip is a group of Native American peoples from western Washington state. The Tulalip people settled onto reservation lands after signing the Point Elliott Treaty with the former Washington Territory on January 22, 1855. The reservation is the western half of the Marysville Tulalip community. Marysville is an incorporated city and lies east of Interstate 5. Tulalip is a reservation and it lies west of Interstate 5.
