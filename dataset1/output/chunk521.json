I was fishing for about a half hour when I heard these strange howls form a distance that lasted for about 20 seconds, it repeated at least 3 or 4 times. I would say the howls where at least a quarter of a mile away. There were 2 people fishing on the lake at the time. The closet person was about 1000 feet away from me. I am very familiar with animal vocalization in the area. The howls where not from black bears, mountain lions or coyotes. Nor where any birds calls. I am a avid birder and I known my bird calls.",

The following details can be added to the report.--This occurred on the Friday of Veterans Day weekend.--Because of the season, there was hardly anyone around.--Witness was fishing on the north side of the lake, and the howl sounded like it came from the SE side of the lake.--The howl was deep, and each howl lasted about 20 seconds each.--The road into Lake Alpine had a \"Bigfoot Crossing\" sign at one time, but it is no longer present.",
