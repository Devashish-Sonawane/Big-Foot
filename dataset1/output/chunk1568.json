            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on 4/22/2006 for over an hour. I found the him to be very credible. He was twenty years old at the time. He said he heard the same sounds two years later in the woods behind his house. The witness's father was present at the time and also heard these sounds. I spoke with the father on 5/4/2006 and confirmed that this took place.Both the witness and his father are avid outdoorsman, hunted and fished all their lives in this area and know their wildlife sounds. Neither one of them ever heard anything like this before. The witness stated to me that a feeling of fear and intimidation came over him when hearing these sounds.In 1974/75 his best friend at the time lived and worked on a farm 9 miles east of where the witness had his encounter. One day when checking on the cows the witness's friend was frightened out of the area by what he called a big monkey in a tree.In 1978/79 the witness and his father were mowing a field a 1/4-mile away from the location of the witness's encounter. The father stayed out past dusk to finish. He returned home earlier than expected and when asked why, he replied that he saw something walk across the cemetery on two legs. It was all dark brown and was not a man or a bear.",

(A) less than a minute....ran across the road, looked my way, and disappeared on the other side of the road...seen from over 100 yards away and was 5 to 6 foot tall.(Q) What in your opinion was the animal using the palm frond for? (A) It wasn't a single palm frond, nor am I sure it was a palm frond....He was covered in green vegetation, almost as if he had made a covering or attached large leaves to his body...we have several trees here with very large leaves, like magnolia and several species of maple and oak, just to name a few.  This was the most striking thing at a distance, and made me feel that either someone had gotten stuck naked in the woods and was trying to cover themselves, or this was a creature who was covering him/herself for camouflage. (Q) How tall was the animal ?(A) I would say between 5-6 feet tall (Q) Do you feel you observed a Monkey or a Bigfoot based  on it's movement? (A) I have a master's from Goddard College in Somatic Psychology, and have done advance studies in Feldenkrais, Wilhelm Reich, Ida Rolf, Judith Aston, and others....This was not human movement. (Q) How long did the observation last? (A) Long enough for me to see it lope across a country two-lane paved road, and disappear down the creek embankment by a small bridge crossing the road.   Ten, fifteen seconds, maybe. (Q) Could you describe the head of the animal? (A) Sorry, no, it was too far away, but it was not holding its head the way a human holds its head, even with bad posture.
