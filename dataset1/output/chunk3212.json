He/She was close to 8 feet tall and extremely muscualr. It was the color of dark rust. All I know is it was the scariest and most bizarre moment of my life. I climbed a small pine tree to get a better look, but he was gone. He/She dissapeared after 3-4 steps.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness for approximately one hour by phone, and found him to be articulate and sincere. He stated that he viewed the creature from a distance of 150-160 yards as it walked parallel to his location. He estimated the height between 6-5\"-6-7' based on his father's 6-1\", 300 lb - frame. While he couldn't make out definitve facial features, he stated that the creature was a consistent color from head to toe, and was either a large, bi-pedal creature with dark, rust colored fur or a large man in a one-piece body suit trying to perpetuate a hoax. The witness considered the only two people that were aware of his location, and phoned them to verify their location to confirm that they were not  playing a practical joke on him. ",

After returning from an Octoberfest barbecue, the witness was with his sister and brother-in-law on the ground level, back yard deck of their condo smoking a cigarette when out of the corner of his eye, he observed a large tall figure with a massive chest and long arms which hung by the creatures knees. The figure walked smoothly from right to left, glancing at them in stride as it continued down the slopped back yard until it reached a four foot wooden fence which it climbed over. On the other side of the fence is a wooded ravine which leads to a golf course. According to the witness; there was just enough daylight for them to conclude that there was no doubt in their minds that they saw a Bigfoot. The creature came from the direction of the Hamburg Mountain Wildlife Management Area, which is a 3,000 acre area of swamps, unmarked hiking trails, roads and is prevalent with black bear, deer and coyotes. The witness' brother-in-law agreed with the account as it was told by the witness. I was unable to interview the third witness as well. ",
