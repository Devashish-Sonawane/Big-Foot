            "Follow-Up Report": "After contacting the husband, we had a good long discussion on what he heard that night. He did his best to describe the sound, but went silent when I imitated a whoop, going low tone to a very high one. He stated that was just about exactly what he had heard, his wife as well. He said when it woke him and he sat there and listened to it a few times, he woke his wife asking for her to listen. She started saying she wasn't hearing anything when she then heard the next whoop. Gauging the volume of the sound, he was able to tell it was getting closer and was repeating more. He stated that he left the bed and went to the back door and opened it shotgun in hand. As the sound was getting closest to the house he fired off 3 rounds in that direction. The whooping stopped but he heard it move off through a section of woods that extended from behind the house to the side. I could tell from the way the man spoke, that he had experienced what he said. Taking the description of the area I was given, I was able to deduce the general region. A large creek flows about a mile from his property and is quite thickly wooded. Bands of wooded land extend out from the creek area, in between fields. One such band runs past his house.  This location is very close to Report #45280 and occurring only a month later. ",
