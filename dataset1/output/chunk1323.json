            "Follow-Up Report": "TBRC investigators and I have spoken with the witness at length on numerous occasions and have conducted onsite investigations of the property. The TBRC investigators and I agreed that the witness is highly credible. The property is indeed remote, rugged, thickly wooded and seemingly ideal for the species.The events as described by the witness relate a fascinating account of possibly how a bigfoot reacts to humans in what it perceives to be its territory. Also, the lack of game in the area at present seems to indicate that the area has been over-hunted, but the witness is quick to inform that humans have certainly not been culpable in this. During my onsite investigation (which lasted well into the night), I noted that the place seemed devoid of any of the normal sounds of the forest. We heard one, very loud, interesting cedar wood knock in the distance (sounding as though a baseball bat had been used against a cedar tree) to which we responded. We heard one owl for perhaps two minutes, and one wolf (which are very rare in Texas). Judging from the lack of sounds and animal tracks even in the creek area, I surmised that the area is rather eerily empty in terms of wildlife.  In talking to the witness about his personal encounter, he described the \"strange noises\" that he heard as sounding akin to human whistling and also poor renditions of owls.The alleged nest could very well be just that. The cedar tree (Eastern Red Cedar or Juniperus virginiana) that I inspected was approximately 40 feet in height. Starting at about 12 - 15 feet up, limbs had been broken all the way down the side and piled up at the base of the tree. The limbs were very thick and seemingly too large to have been broken by anything without an unusually inordinate amount of strength and weight. Although there is no direct evidence that the nest was constructed by a bigfoot, the TBRC investigators and I were at a loss as to what else may have created it or caused it to happen. To me, it appeared to be beyond happenstance. Further, I know of no animals in North America or the world for that matter, that could have constructed the crude shelter save for humans - and bigfoot. Photos of the purported nest appear below.From the backside of the \"nest\":All limbs have been broken off and piled below:The \"roof\" - about five or six feet high:The man in the photo is over six feet tall:Indications at this time are that the creature has moved on. The nest area certainly seems to have gone some time without use. The witness, TBRC investigators and I have found no recent tracks, but investigation continues and the area will remain one of high interest for some time.Updates will be posted as they are obtained.

            "Observed": "On the morning noted a neighborhood man was driving down Pilottown Road around 4-5 in the morning when he came across large human-like footprints crossing the road and heading into a field/wooded area. I was almost 17 and when I woke up later that morning several neighbors were inspecting the tracks which came from a field behind my house, through my yard, across Cookslanding Road, into my neighbors yard, over a fence into a wooded area, across Pilottown Road and into the field/wooded area. The direction of travel appeared to be south east toward the Susquehanna River hills. Whatever made the tracks did take the time to inspect my rabbit hutch and my neighbors as well, though leaving them undisturbed. it also seemed to have walked around my neighbor's house, leaving 1 very good print protected by the overhang of the roof. The rest were partially filled with snow, but still unsettling due to their size and shape. The tracks were about 16\" long, 8.5\" wide, and 2\" deep in the snow, and had a stride of about 4 feet. I am including a tracing I took of the well preserved track I found. It may seem a very incredible way of preserving the footprint, but it was the only thing I could think to do to preserve it. I traced over it EXACTLY as it appeared in the snow. To this day nobody knows what made the tracks. My neighbor and several other people of the neighborhood are avid hunters and outdoorsman. They didn't know what to make of them. I am not saying this is sasquatch, but here is the 'tracing':",
