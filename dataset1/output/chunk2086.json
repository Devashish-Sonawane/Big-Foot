            "Observed": "I have been walking my dog through Harris Forest Preserve for about 5 weeks now. About the last 3 days we have been walking back there I noticed a foul smell and starge howling noises. I didn't think much of it at the because I've heard alot of coyotes howling in the area. I should also add my dog seemed pretty stressed out and affraid the last couple walks we were on. The last walk we went on was kind of late, from 6 till about 7 pm after dark. We heard quite a few knocks on trees that seemed pretty close by and rocks were being thrown at me and my dog. At first I thought it was some kids screwing around, until I got through the trail to the pond in back. I was paralysed with fear after what happened next. I believe it was a Bigfoot that ran out about 10 feet in front of me and stopped for about 15 seconds, it let out a very loud scream right at me then turned around and ran straight through the pond. I also noticed that behind me appeared to be another very large figure that ran the opposite direction. The first one I got a very clear view of, I was 8 to 9 feet tall with very wide shoulders about twice as wide as mine, it had dark brown hair mixed with some grey, and it smelled awful. I did not get a very good look at the other one but it did appear to be 8 to 10 feet tall. I have never really been a believer and as a matter of fact I am the kind of person more likely to make fun of a believer. That being said I am having a hard time coming up with an explanation for this. This happen in early Janurary and it was about 35 degrees out and I don't think a person playing a joke would be able to handle the water temps.",

            "Observed": "I was fly fishing by a lake in WA. I was all alone. I was setting up my camp I got bored and started singing softly. A short time later I started smelling what smelled like dirty cat litter. I thought that was really odd after a while I just ignored it. Then I started breaking the big branches to make my fire. After breaking the really big branches I heard a loud very loud knock. I thought that was odd because I was the only one around I was high up. So I thought maybe that was a bear coming down a tree or something. So after that I did some screams to try to scare it away. So I started my fire I had some meat out by the fire. After a while I started hearing whistles I was like what the heck I never heard a bird like that. Mind you I\u0092m in the mountains a lot so when that happened I started to be on my guard. I also lived in Yosemite for 9 months. After cooking one pork chop I had one still laying on the rock beside me. I started hearing rustling in the trees behind me so I grabbed my bear spray. I went to go check it out and didn\u0092t see a bear. So I went back to camp didn\u0092t think about anymore. After I was done with my dinner a big rock came crashing by almost hitting my car. I thought it was just a rock falling from a cliff. Then I started thinking about it there\u0092s no cliffs by me what the heck! So I started screaming to scare it away. I did that for a minute or two then relaxed for a bit. Then another big rock was thrown so I got really pissed off and started really yelling. Then I thought my mind is just playing tricks so I ignored it. Then maybe 20, 30 minutes later a really big rock was thrown. When that happened again I knew it wasn\u0092t my mind playing games with me. So I was thinking is this really happening? A couple of minutes passed another rock thrown. So I started to yell again then I heard a really angry loud whoop sound like I never heard before. I could feel it inside me it was that loud like you were at a concert or something. I got really scared and drove away.",
