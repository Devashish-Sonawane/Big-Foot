            "Also Noticed": "The area around the check station is heavily hunted since there are many crawl throughs the fence from hogs on the state park side.  Hunters wait for the hogs to travel from the State Park under the fence into the WMA.  There were a lot of hunters in the vicinity of the sound all day, so I do not expect that there was much wildlife around due to the human activity.  There was one hog killed in that area earlier in the day.  The Game Wardens patrol this WMA heavily due to the popularity and crowds that show up for hog hunts.  They clear the area before leaving each night and did so this night.  They left us with the biologist as the last ones in the area.",

Go past the dam and follow the dirt road into the woods.  Pass through the State Park area and through the gated entrance into the WMA.  The check station and parking area is several hunderd yards past the gate. The sounds were about 75 to 100 yards behind the check station towards a marshy area that borders the WMA and State Park (Southwest direction).",

There was a lot of activity in the woods that day as this place gets crowded during hog hunts.  We were the last hunters to leave and we were talking to the check station attendant (biologist).  It was about an hour after dark and it was starting to get cold.  There was only a propane heater and latern running at the check station.  The Game Wardens had cleared the WMA of all vehicles, so we know that we were the only ones left in the area.",
