The moon was full and I thought perhaps I would see deer running from the field. What I saw was still creates goose bumps on my arms. Standing 30 feet from me and approximately 20 feet from the woods was an extremely large creature. It was between 7 and 8 feet tall and could have weighed as much as 500 pounds. It had a very short neck and arms that reached nearly to the knees. It made no movement toward me. The face was not visible due to the time of day. I was loaded down with compound bow and portable deer stand. I cannot detail the fear I experienced getting back to my jeep. I didn't shine the flashlight at it, as I was too frightened. The next day I went back armed with a 300 Weatherby to look for signs, but the ground was to hard to see tracks. There were no bushes in the field. There was no mistake in what I saw.",

We had set up camp earlier that day and were getting ready to start cooking some dinner. I'm not sure of the exact time but it was just before nightfall. We were not camped close to anybody because for some reason the campgrounds were empty. I think the nearest people were a family that were camped about 300 feet away.",
