We were camped on a river, with no one around for miles, and deer would frequently cross the river at our campsite. We kept our trash bagged up approx 30 yards from our camping area to deter bears from being drawn close to the camp area. We had 2 adult dogs and 5 newborn puppies as well. The female dog had pups on the trip.",

Fishing season had opened about a month before and my rotwieler and I were walking back from the lake. We were walking on a dirt road through some deep woods that turned into two Christmas tree farms the road went through some Christmas trees that were old maybe 15 + yrs. and a younger batch 2-3 yrs. old. We were walking just out of the woods into the two tree farms maybe a couple hundred yards when I looked off to the right and saw a big brown object moving swiftly through the small 2- 3yr. old Christmas trees. It was far away maybe 400 yards and the Christmas trees were 5-7 feet high and at first I thought it was an elk moving at that distance.",
