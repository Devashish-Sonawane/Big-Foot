I'm not sure if she'd want to talk about the incident as it scared her.  She didn't tell a lot of people for fear that she would be made fun of.",

It never stood on two legs while she was present. She described it as powerfully built and covered in black hair. The face reflecting orange eyes in her car headlights terrified the witness. Passing by the sighing location to this day makes her nervous. Her description of its facial expression was, \u0093It was an animal, but it looked like it had intelligence behind its eyes\".She reflected that she has seen most of the animals in West Virginia at one time or another. Last month she saw a wildcat, bear, deer and most of the smaller animals. This one was definitely not anything previously seen. ",
