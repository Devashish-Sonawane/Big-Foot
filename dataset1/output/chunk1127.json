The witness stated he had no prior interest in Bigfoot. He admitted that before that day, he would be the guy that make fun of someone who said they saw a Bigfoot. I drove to the location the week after I spoke with the witness. His directions were exact. I found the area where his car was stuck. I looked for any dried mud (from the debris the creature threw) but the road is well traveled by hunters every day. I walked back looking for a water source as the creature appeared wet and found a natural spring boil that flowed into a creek just 30 yards into the brush. I followed as best I could but the brush was thick and quiet difficult to move in. This is a very wild area with much wildlife, water (even in the dry season), and cover. It could easily hide and survive in here. Other than the road that runs thru it (accessable by 4X4's only), it is a big, remote forest/swamp with very few hikers. ",

Her mother then called my place of work to have me come back to house to take a look around, as I first arrived, I noticed that there was some kind of bad odor in the area but as i keep looking around along with my coworker, who gave me ride back to my house, and my mother-in-law, on the east side of the house where there is no lights, we all heard something stepping on twigs or branches laying on the ground for the snapping and breaking noise that it makes, as I attempted to walk towards the noise, whatever was there seemed to move farther back into the woods out of reach of my flashlight, after looking around we went to ask my sister-in-law if she could say who or what she had seen in the window, all she could say was that it was \"big, black, hairy\" and something about its eyes, she is really talkative all of the time but after that happened she looked liked she was in shock her face was pale and her eyes seemed to liked she was lost.",
