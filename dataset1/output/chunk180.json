            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness regarding his experience. While speaking about his hunting incident, he started by explaining how the woods go from day to night almost like a \u0093click of a switch\u0094 as the nocturnal animals start to become active. He said it was about this time of day (approximately 5:30 PM EST) when the ape-like sounds started. What he heard raised the hairs on the back of his neck. He said the sounds were almost \u0093orangutan-like\u0094 in a series of seven vocalizations. He said almost instantly, to the south of him in the distance, he could hear a response to the seven vocalizations. He then heard a second set of vocalizations from the direction in which the original vocalizations were first heard, as if something was responding to the vocalizations to his south. There was not  a second set of return vocalizations from the south, however.The witness was adamant these sounds were natural and not man-made because he stated after all of the vocalizations ended, the birds briefly stopping chirping, and then matter-of-factly resumed their chirping, almost as if this was a daily occurrence. Even though the personal account of the witness states, \"After the calls none returned and the area was very quiet, even the song birds.\" he told me that after a brief time the birds did resume their chirping and singing as is these sounds were something they were used to. His dog, a Rottweiller, ran when the vocalization started and did not want to return to the area. As he left the woods that day he said he estimates the animal came within fifty to sixty yards of him, although he couldn\u0092t completely say due to the fact the area was very thickly wooded and covered with a thick growth of Palmettos. According to the witness, \u0093a lot of hunters\u0094 have heard these same sounds, although he believes he\u0092s the first to officially make a report. He is very familiar with bear, alligators, and wild hogs and he\u0092s certain that what he heard was not any of these animals. He stated that he heard vocalizations almost identical to what he heard on a Mysterious Encounters episode in early June of 2005. The swamp he was hunting in comes off the Edisto River and its tributaries. He was hunting off a dike road with water approximately eight feet deep off to the sides. He did look for tracks, but said the road was very soft sand and no tracks or footprints were found. He also made a brief reference to hunters hearing similar sounds in the Dismal Swamp area of North Carolina, although he\u0092s not had an encounter himself there yet. He also said he was aware of three encounters near Camp Lejeune (Jacksonville, N. C). and New Bern, N. C. with Marines who were on military training missions. At the conclusion of their training missions they were followed out of the woods by something that sounded very large and bipedal. After this experience they refused to go back into the area without weapons.  The witness believes it's possible that the same animals are traveling back and forth between North Carolina and South Carolina by using the Intracostal Waterway as a possible \u0093avenue\u0094 or \u0093road\u0094 of travel.",

We were facing our pasture behind the house that I grew up in. We were talking quietly and not moving much. My parents have a propane tank which is silver in color and approx. 20 to 25 feet long that sits approx 50 yards behind their house.  As we were both looking towards the pasture we noticed something approximately 7 to 8 ft tall running across the pasture. It became more visible as it ran in front of the propane tank and was running in an upright position. It was dark in color. It ran southwestward towards the tree line of the pasture, but distinctly we could see it turn and look at us as it ran. Simultaneously my boyfriend and myself asked each other if we saw that, and ran into the house telling my mother.  She grabbed a flashlight and shown it towards the pasture and saw nothing.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "As the couple were leaning with their backs to the truck, they both saw a large creature approximately 8 foot tall run in front of the white butane tank that was in the pasture.  The sighting lasted approximately 5 seconds as the creature was running to the woods.  The creature was covered in dark hair and had a forward leaning, lumbering jog.  The witness describes the arms as being very long and the jog was funny looking.  The witness could not make out any major features other than the size which was very big and muscular.There have been other incidents, as recently as one year ago in that area.",
