            "Follow-Up Report": "After interviewing the witness, there are three things that stand out about this report.  First, the evening of Sunday September 2nd, it was reported that the bird dog belonging to the witness spotted something in the woods which made it go \"on point\", and also frightened it so badly that it was shaking. They ended up putting the dog in the truck.Second, when the witness awoke on Monday morning, September 3rd, he hear four loud footsteps of something big walking away from his camp site. Third, both the witness and his girlfriend heard wood knocks for about 20 minutes starting around an hour after the heavy footsteps.  The pattern was such that it could not have been a woodpecker or other cause.Based on these three facts, I can only conclude that the witness and his girlfriend had a class B encounter with a sasquatch.  It is very likely that they were observed through the night.",

            "Observed": "It was early November 2002. My buddy and I went fishing on Bingham Creek in the Matlock area. It was in the early afternoon. It was a snowy day, and I was kind of suprised that it was snowing so early. We were fishing in hip waders, my friend was about 20 feet upstream from me when we heard a sound like a huge log being smacked against a tree about 100 yards away from us, I think to our west/northwest. I think the sound of the log hitting the tree was about 3 times, whack, whack, whack. Soon after we heard the same sound coming from about 100 yards away from the first one, and the same distance from us. The area that the noises were coming from were on the same side of the stream that we had come from our vehicle from. I looked at my friend and said, \"what was that?\" He replied that he didn't know. My friend has been hunting all over western Washington since he was nine years old,  and is very familiar with the wild life here and the noises they make, I might add. We didn't think much of it when a few minutes went by and we heard the most eerie growling roar I have ever heard. I really don't know how to describe it, but whatever made that sound was not being as close to as loud as it could have been, and the sound still went right through me. I could feel it in my chest. I was more terrified than I had ever been in my life and I ran to my friend upstream. I don't know which one of us did it first, but we both ended up putting our hands up over our heads and yelling trying to dissuade whatever it was from coming after us. I was more scared than I had ever been. We got out of the creek at this point, and grabbing some rocks headed back to the truck through the woods. I was bringing up the rear and keeping watch as we went. I was much calmer walking back. On the way back we were even joking around about it. Back at the truck I asked my friend what he thought it was. He said he didn't know, but he knew it wasn't a bear, cougar, elk or anything else he'd ever heard before. I never made a report of it before because I just never thought of it before until reading some similar stories on your site. I believe that whatever we heard that day was a sasquatch. My friend also believes what we heard was a sasquatch.",
