My wife and i were facing the house and my brother-in-law and girlfriend were facing us. In the midst of our conversation, we heard a loud scream. Growing up in the country and raised on a farm, i have heard most of the common North American animal calls.  I have NEVER heard anything that screamed like this. We had about 300 yards of field and yards before it turned to woods. We didnt see it, but it sounded almost as if it were just behind us. At the same time, there was another approx. 1/2 mile down the road and they were yelling back and forth as if they were talking. The lungs on these creatures were amazing!",

He and his wife and his brother were visiting with his in-laws at their home.  His in-laws had recently moved to the Cleveland, Tennessee area from Detroit.  Their home is in an area where approximately 15 houses sit in a half circle.  There was one other house between his in-laws house and the woods.  On the evening in question the witness, his wife, her brother and her brother's girlfriend were on the back porch of his in-laws home when they heard an extremely loud 'scream' from the woods.  The estimated distance was 300 - 400 yards.  This scream was answered by another animal that was estimated to be approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile away.  Calls went back and forth 6 or 7 times.  The witness was stunned by the volume of the calls.  ",
