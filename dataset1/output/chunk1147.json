He saw the creature as it leaned from behind the tree, from mid-shin up. He said the face resembled a orangutan, and although he was very frightened by the encounter, the creature did not seem menacing or aggressive in any way. The witness and the others that were there never spoke about the encounter, and he is not sure if the others saw anything. I encouraged him to speak to his brother to see if he has any memories of the event. His brother is currently on military assignment and not available. I hope to speak with him in the near future.",
