            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness, the following details can be added:-the growl heard by the witness and his daughter was possibly within 100 yards, and lasted about 6 seconds; they were hiking on a trail in Shades State Park that runs to Sugar Creek, then loops back to the parking lot-the stack of rocks was made up of 4 rounded river rocks; the witness was emphatic that nobody could have been to that spot during the previous day to do anything like that, as the water had receded sometime during the night to expose this area...if the rocks were stacked previously, it is probable they would have collapsed due to the strong current -there were a total of 3 howls, each lasting 3-4 seconds each, with a few seconds between howls; coyotes would join in halfway through each howl, then all would stop at nearly the same time...they originated from the north, towards Shades State ParkShades State Park is bordered by Turkey Run State Park to the southwest, and Pine Hills Nature Preserve to the east.  Sugar Creek runs through both state parks, eventually flowing into the Wabash river to the west.  Though this is the first report from Shades state park, two reports from Turkey Run State Park are included in the BFRO's database:Report #25240Report #19588",
