It's back line did not parallel the ground as one sees in a bear or big cat.-The head appeared large, with excessive hair, like a mane, contributing to its appearance. The eyes reflecting in the witness' head lights were large as well.-The creature's body was massive, it did not have a snout, a tail was not noticed, and its ears were hidden by thick hair.-The shoulder line appeared to the witness to be 3 or more feet off the ground. The head extended well above the shoulders-The figure's gait, as it moved into the wood line, was lumbering and not as smooth as that of a full time quadruped, such as a large cat.-The hair color in his head lights was a light brown, with darker brown in the thick, mane-like hair around the head and shoulders.
