            "Observed": "My boyfriend was driving me and some friends through  a wooded area near Mio, Michigan. It is some dirt roads to the left of 33(This was my first time to this part so I am not certain, exactly where I was).  We were cruising along looking at the woods that had been recently burned down. Down the road right after this hill, my boyfriend and I both saw a white figure crossing the road. Jokingly he says \"there is sasquatch\", we both just assumed it was a human since it was walking upright across the road.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Talked to the witness and she added information to her written report.  She said her first impression was it was someone riding a bike -leaning over and legs spinning.  It was too far away for her to see the face or arms clearly.  She gave me the phone number of the boyfriend who also saw the animal.Talked to the US Forest Service rep for that area.  He said  that area burned over April 30, 2006.  It is called the Hughes Lake burn and 5900 acres of jackpiney area burned over and included the area indicated by the witness.Valley Road is about 7 miles south of Mio and there are 2 lakes about 3 miles west from M33 so the sighting should have been in that area.",

We were driving down Lanes Ferry Hwy about 5:00am when we came around a curve and some thing ran across the road in front of us in the headlights. I looked at my buddy and said \"did you see that?\" and he said \"Yes, what was it?\"  I said it looked like a baby bigfoot. He said that's what he thought also but wanted to make sure i did too. He was about 4 or 5 ft tall and you could see his arms swinging when he ran ran across the road from one cow pasture to the other headed towards the bluff and the river in the same direction as where we were going to hunt.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I was able to talk with the witness by phone. He stressed that the sighting was brief and so sudden that the driver did not even have time to hit the brakes. The car came very close to hitting the creature.  The witness stressed that the creature was running very fast, somewhat \"hunched over, like a person running fast\" with its long arms swinging. Although the creature was 5 feet or less in height, it's body build did not seem slender. This may have been due to the thickness of the body hair. The dark brown body hair was comparable in length and texture to an English sheepdog according to the witness. He did not notice any facial details. ",
