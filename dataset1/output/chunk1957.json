            "Follow-Up Report": "12-30-07 I talked to both witnesses via phone. Although the area is currently more developed, almost 10 years earlier this couple were pretty much the only ones living in that area. I found these people very matter-of-fact and to the point on their experience. I know this area is very heavily forested to this day. I was invited to come by the witness residence and hope to update this report soon.4-10-08 I went and visited the witness 4-08-08, Tuesday evening. He showed me the property and the heavily wooded area downhill from his house where many game trails were found. Deer and turkey have been abundant recently in that area. We found possible footprints of humanoid nature but were larger than mine (size 13eee) and a possible tree sign. I yelled out 3 howls in the woods and heard a possible response from a distance. I then left the witnesses at 7:15 pm. That same evening the witness' sister in-law who lives in the old trailer home next to the new house, heard at 10:30 pm, a long \"whoop\" coming from the woods to which nieghbor dogs were barking at. And her cat started growling to the noise as well. A few hours later the sister-in-law was woke up by very loud roar seemingly close to her home, this reported to me at 5:25 p.m. via phone 4-10-08, I spoke to her and the witness.",
