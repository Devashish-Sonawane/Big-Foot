Looked out the door and saw a bigfoot standing near the fire and he says they made eye contact and the creature ran off.  He claims the next day they tracked the animal with the help of the dogs on a leash. He said that the dogs led him to a fence and on the top strand of barbed wire there was long black matted hair that smelled worse than any hog could have. Plus it was on the top strand.",

With all of their outdoor experience they have never heard anything similar to those loud, heavy footfalls. Ben is 6' 2\" and wears size 12 boots.  The prints they found were much larger than his own.  It was early morning, still dark and little or no moon so they could barely make out a silhouette of the creature.

We turned onto a very bumpy, pot-holed gravel road a few miles from the town of Ashford. After getting through a number of trees that had blown down in the wind storms of winter, 2006, we reached a dead-end at a bridge over the Nisqually River that had washed out in the record rains and flooding of November, 2006. We were about a mile...maybe more..from the nearest blacktop road and any human habitation. We had decided to make a day of shooting so we brought an automatic trap machine, several boxes of biodegradable clay pidgions, LOTS of shotgun shells in trap loads, chairs, a folding table, plenty of food and drinks (coffee, water, fruit juices, tea) however...no alcohol because my friend and his wife are diabetic and I take meds that don't mix well with alcohol. Therefore, we just don't drink. Besides, booze and guns NEVER go well together under ANY circumstances.",
