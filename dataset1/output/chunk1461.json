            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness on 5/08/2007 Witness told me that in the early morning hours of 4/24/2007 he was walking his dog as usual. As he approached the end of the driveway his dog started to act like something was wrong. The dog began to bark at something in the woodline next to his home. After a few  minutes he thought he saw a large animal standing next to a large tree just inside the treeline. He looked for a moment and then headed back to the house with the dog, which by now was at his side and wanted no part of what was in the woods.  About the time he reached the porch he heard a loud, Ohio type howl. He went inside to get ready for work. When he started out the driveway of his home, he thought he saw, through the pre-dawn darkness, a large dark upright figure walking past the fence that boarders his yard.  He has agreed to let me visit him in person for follow up investigation.",
