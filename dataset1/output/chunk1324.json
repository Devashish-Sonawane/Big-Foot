            "Follow-Up Report": "At the time of this incident, the witness was a teenager who had lived in his neighborhood for a long time. Upon finding the tracks, he traced what was considered the most well preserved one out of the series. This one in particular was under the overhang of the neighbor's roof and thus was somewhat protected from the additional overnight snowfall after the print had been made. It should also be noted that the track faced the house directly, however the witness could not recall whether there was a window at that part of the house or not.As described by the witness, it was obvious that whatever made the large tracks was inspecting the surroundings (two rabbit hutches, house, etc.) judging by the path that it took and how the tracks mulled around these structures before heading into the Susquehanna River Valley.While this incident happened in the winter of 1994, the witness states that this area had a rich history of sightings and incidents dating back decades. He relayed to me two incidents in particular. The first happened to his uncle in the early 1980s while he was plowing a field during the springtime. As he crested a rise in the field with the tractor he noticed a creature sitting on the ground just inside of the woodline. The moment the creature became aware of the approaching farm tractor, it stood up on two legs and walked deeper into the woods and out of sight.The second sighting also occurred in the early 1980s on the witness' grandparents' farm which is located in the same general vicinity and leads directly to the Susquehanna River Valley. His grandparents had given permission to some neighbors to snowmobile on their property. As the neighbors approached a lightly wooded fence row, a creature stood up on two legs and walked down the hill towards the river and out of sight. During the mid-1980s the area started to experience significant development and thus these types of sightings and strange incidents began to dwindle. The last event that the witness recalls happening is the one of the snow tracks in this report.",

The tree is about 30 feet tall.  \u0095 The witness observed what he describes as a four foot animal looking the other direction having a wedge shaped head.\u0095 The hair was one to two inches long on it's body, being longer on it's head. The hair was orange-reddish brown fur like an orangutan's.\u0095 The animal's arms appeared to be longer than a human's.      \u0095 The witness was unable to see the animal's face as it moved away from him and he was not longer able to see it.Map showing the sighting area just west of Glenwood Woods Forest Preserve.Satellite photo showing the hedge apple trees that line the property and where the sighting occurred.
