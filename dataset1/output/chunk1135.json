            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness via telephone. When the animal entered the eastbound lanes of the highway, it was nearly struck by the large semi. The other vehicles immediately slammed on their brakes as the animal entered the road.It was able to cross the eastbound lanes in about two strides. The witness watched the animal as it entered the wooded median. The witness' wife was able to keep her eyes on the animal as it walked through the median and crossed the westbound lanes. After the animal crossed the road, the witness was able to confirm that his parents had seen the animal as well. The witness was able to see that the truck driver was visibly shaken by what he had seen.The creature was described as much taller than an average man, with a huge stride length. It's movements were incredibly fast, and fluid. It was completely black in color.  I found the witness to be highly credible, with a clear memory of the event.It is my opinion that the size and speed of the bipedal creature (as well as its potentially fatal decision to cross a busy highway) eliminate the possibility that it was a human.
