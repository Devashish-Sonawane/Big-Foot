            "Observed": "Driving North and just crossed the border into Tennessee from North Carolina on Hwy #441 & #71, driving toward Gattlinburg, TN. It was getting dark so we drove on down the mountain. After a few minutes of driving around curves in the highway, we came to a straight section of the highway and could see street lights through the tree covered highway about a mile ahead. There was a curve in the highway where they were positioned. All of a sudden from our vantage point, the lights illuminated the shadow side of a very tall being crossing the highway from the left to the right which was less than a half mile in front of us. We all had a clear view of this being from the shadow side. It looked hairy and not clothed. It was walking on two feet the entire crossing of the highway. We could not see anything when we got to the area this  being had crossed due to darkness. It was ape like in my opinion and large. I found this website and although a its been a few years ago, I wanted to tell what my wife & I and our two friends saw & experienced. I think, Big Foot is in those woods ,,,,,,,,,,,somewhere.",

The husband is a retired maintenance mechanic. His wife is a retired nurse. The third witness is a business owner. The two Texas couples were on vacation to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park near Newfoundland Gap when the sighting occurred.In addition to his written account, I can add the following details: - The third witness who was up front immediately said to the others, \u0093Are you seeing this?\"- All three stated that the animal was at least 7\u0092 tall, and did not look to acknowledge the vehicle.- It was approximately 150 yards away.- It was moving from left to right on two legs while crossing the road.- It took approximately 4 to 5 steps to cross the road.",

            "Observed": "Was hiking/running the Stuart Fork trail (Trinity Alps)yesterday, and came upon about a dozen footprints right where the trail enters Morris Meadows. The trail gets very heavy use (tho didnt see anyone yesterday) so the prints are most likely a prank or maybe superimposed boot prints, but they interested me enough to make this report (i personally dont believe in bigfoot). They werent very clear, but each print was about 15\" long and the they were a good 4+ feet apart. They were much deeper than surrounding boot prints, which is what caught my attention. I took a few photos; ill send you a copy when they get developed.",

The most notable was a hornet that was apparently stepped on and smashed into the print. - He also reported other strange occurrences several months earlier while camping alone not far from this meadow within the Trinity Alps Wilderness area.  He stated he heard what seemed to be bi-pedal footsteps and grunting around the outside of his tent during the night.  He says he checked the area with a flashlight immediately, but saw nothing.-The following are photos the witness took of the footprints.",
