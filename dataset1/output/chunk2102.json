The temperature had dropped dramatically, causing a fog to rise over a stream between myself and the animal, partly obscuring my view. I had parked alongside the road, and was standing behind my car, looking into the woods when I spotted the animal standing in the undergrowth (growth is approximately five feet tall, and the animal was approximately three feet above that, slightly bent over).",
