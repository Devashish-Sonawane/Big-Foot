            "Follow-Up Report": "I communicated with the witness by email and telephone, then met with him at his home where the audio was recorded and the trackway photographed. He has proven to be sincere and trustworthy.The witness lives in a rural area surrounded by abundant woodlands filled with wildlife and water sources. On August 27, 2011, he set up a Mole motion activated, IR assist, night vision camera that also records audio when activated. That night, as the witness and his family were watching television, something activated the Mole. It was probably a flying insect because that was the only thing visible in the video recorded. But the audio that was recorded featured some faint music from the television and a couple of distant unknown vocalizations: * TWO WHOOPS *On the morning of January 22, 2012, after considerable snow had fallen during the previous week, the witness looked out his window and noticed unusual tracks in the snow in his backyard. He photographed the backyard from his home and later took photographs in the yard with a tape measure. The snow had melted considerably due to rain and above freezing temperatures shortly after the snow storm, so the tracks deteriorated. Despite the poor condition of the tracks, the step length could be reasonably determined and consistently measured 5 feet or more from heel to heel.Two photos from the house. Large trackway stands out:Trackway in yard showing classic tightrope pattern: Measurement of heel to heel step length is 5 to 6 feet:Zoom in of melted print with tape measure:The tree cages serve as scale items in the photos and are between 5 and 6 ft wide and 6 ft tall: On January 27, the witness deployed a trail camera that also records audio (a different camera than what he used to capture the audio in August). He placed it on one of the trees in his backyard that the snow trackway had passed. The trail camera has a glitch that causes it to record audio with a persistent electronic buzz. Despite the glitch, the following audio was recorded that night and contains what sounds like heavy bipedal walking: * BIPEDAL WALKING *",

He knows the common big animals that inhabit the area, and what their tracks look like.Based on his description of the tracks, and that his wife was also a witness to the track line and the one clear track, which showed clear toes and dermal ridges, I conclude that the witness did indeed find tracks that were made by a sasquatch.",
