I noticed something run quickly in front of that truck. I did not see the thing run from the opposite side of the road, though obviously that\u0092s where it came from. I noticed it when it was right in the middle of the road. I\u0092m guessing that the truck is between 5\u0092 and 6\u0092 tall. From my view, behind the truck, I could still see about 1\u0092 of the thing over the top of the cab before it came back into full view and went up into the woods that run right by the road. During the second or two that it came back into full view after crossing in front of the truck, I was able to see it\u0092s silhouette fully in the headlights from the truck. It was on two legs, dark in color, wide (depth of the body, from back to chest-I don\u0092t mean the broadness of the shoulders as I saw it from the side), large legs and very tall. Because of it\u0092s position and it being dark out, I was not able to see the face or front of it.  I\u0092m not able to give any description of  the fur or hair that was covering it either. I wish I could tell you that I saw a Bigfoot. Since I can\u0092t say that for sure, I will tell you what I did NOT see, for sure. I did not see a deer, elk, bear or man.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness on the phone and found her to be credible. I can add the following details to her report:- She estimates the creature to have been less than 20 feet in front of the truck she was behind. If it hadn't moved so fast, she believes it would have been hit.- It was dark out, but she could clearly see the size and shape of the creature from the illumination of the truck's headlights. - The height was probably between six and a half to seven feet tall. The body was thick and the legs \"looked like big human legs\".",

I was in the back of my property and cutting the grass and clearing the path I use behind my house in the woods to target shoot. It was earlier this fall in the beginning of October. I saw something out of the corner of my eye and I stopped the mower and looked towards something I saw moving in the brush along a ravine. I did not see it's face but I watched it for about a minute walking away from me. The funny thing is that it was walking upright which I know bears can do but I am not sure for how long. I am not sure if the mower I was riding startled it. I wanted to contact the local law enforcement but they would think I was crazy. All I can say for sure is that there has been a number of Gunieas and turkeys that my neighbor raises that have been eaten, since I find the feathers all over the place in my pasture and in my neighbors property. My neighbor has even put up a trail camera but to date all he has captured was some coyotes and foxes on it. I have not told anyone not even my neighbor who put up the trail cameras for fear they will think I am crazy. He thinks it is just the fox or coyotes. I investigated the area the next day and I am not ashamed to say I was afraid that day. All I found was disturbed brush and a game trail that I imagine the deer and other animals use. It feels good to write this story for my peace of mind.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I arrived an hour before nightfall in a pretty heavy snow storm and observed the location to be heavily wooded with several nearby water sources. The house and property sit back from the road a bit with most of the forested area behind their home. The witness took me to the location where the animal was last seen. The landscape is thick with trees and slopes down slightly into a ravine with a small creek running through the bottom of it. The ravine and creek run north towards Cloverdale Lake and the entire area is private property used for hunting in the fall. The rest of the year there is little to no human traffic through there. I placed myself in the bottom of the ravine, standing in the creek where the witness first spotted the creature, and had them return to the spot they were during the encounter. The witness estimated the creature to be 1-2ft taller than myself, I\u0092m just a hair over 6ft tall. The animal had longer hair, much longer than a bear, walked upright throughout the whole encounter, which lasted a few minutes, and was very dark in color. Since it walked down the creek at the bottom of the ravine no tracks were visible and the property line prevented further investigation to the north.I ran into the neighbor, who was bow hunting in the wooded area just east of the witness\u0092s property, and they invited me to look around on their land. They had a few tree stands and deer feeders placed around their property and one trail camera. They\u0092d only really seen coyotes, foxes and smaller animals like squirrels on their camera. The neighbor did say he\u0092s seen a drastic decrease in the deer population on their property and surrounding woods over the last few years.The witness seemed very credible and the area looks right for an incident of this type. There is plenty of water nearby and ample food supply with the farms and local wildlife. Between the description of the animal from the witness, the lack of deer nearby and the recent loss of farm animals it\u0092s very possible a Bigfoot moved through here in October. There is enough area for a large animal to live for a season at most, it would likely have to move on after a few months. I left contact information and will follow up if anything else turns up in the future.",
