            "Observed": "At approx. 2 am, 35 campers were awakened to the most god awful screams in the woods. They sounded like a wounded animal and we thought maybe a wounded cougar. Others in the campground thought it may be a bear. 6 of us went to try and determine the source of the noise. We entered the woods to the east of the campground. We used flashlights to light our way and I was in lead and went towards the noise. It seemed fairly close to us.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness and have the following details to add:- These \u0093screams\u0094 were unusual and unusually loud. A group campground experienced this occurrence \u0093en masse\u0094 and people from various geographic locations and backgrounds were upset and perplexed by this experience.  So much so, that a group of seasoned outdoor adventurers went into the woods to try to determine what animal was making this noise.- Although they initially attempted to associate the sound with an injured mountain lion or bear, they were not convinced these assumptions were correct. Many debated this and soon determined that they were hearing a sound that no one had experienced. Thus, they made an effort to find the source of the screams.- After ten minutes in the woods near the perimeter of camp, they neared the source of the screams.  At that moment, the animal making the noise abruptly retreated through the woods, crashing through the underbrush and trees in a very loud manner. The witness has hunted elk and has heard an elk retreat from his presence \u0093crashing through the brush, and this sounded heavier than that.\u0094- One other thing to note: All the dogs in camp were \u0093dead quiet\u0094 during this event.Whereas we have many reports of unusual sounds and smells, this one is fairly unique in that everyone in this campground was awakened, and came out of their tents during this event.We are seeking additional witnesses to this event. We would request that if you were camping at this location on this memorable night, please submit an additional report to our website.Please refer to report number 9944.  Thank you.",
