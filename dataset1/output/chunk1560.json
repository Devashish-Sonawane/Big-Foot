            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.He was driving on Sherman Creek Pass on a fairly sunny afternoon. About 300 yards down the highway, a huge hairy bodied figure, at least eight feet tall, walked across the road in three long steps. It had a large head and was swinging arms up to four feet long. It did not turn its head and went into a swampy area. The terrain was then uphill. Even though it was 300 yards, the witness tried to imagine the size of a person at that distance and this figure was huge.The witness, an avid hunter, lived on a 1600 acre ranch in Ferry County for 24 years. He as amazed at what he saw. He had never seen any animal such as that. I find him very credible.  ",

            "Observed": "I have two experiences about 30 years apart at the same location - my parents home in Pike County, Kentucky - that I have always wanted to talk about.  The first occurred around 1966 or 1967.  It was sometime during the winter months, I'm not sure exactly now.  We awoke one morning to a pretty good snow fall, 4-6 inches or so.  The unusual part was a huge number of large humanlike tracks behind our house in the snow coming from the hillside to our back yard right up to the house.  I remember my Mom and Dad talking about the tracks and showing them to me and my younger brother and Mom being afraid to let us go out and play in the snow for a long time after that.  We couldn't understand why or how a person could be out on that hillside in a snowstorm in the middle of the night. The hill is very steep in that area and it's not easy to climb under the best conditions.  Yet, these tracks led right down the hillside to our house very visible as far as we could see up the hill.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Followed up with witness on 10/19/2011. The witness has two experiences at the same location almost thirty years apart.  The first incident happened when he was 6 or 7 years old.  He remembers that his family woke one morning to 4 to 6 inches of snow and that there were a number of unusually large tracks coming down the mountain and wandering into his back yard.  The witness stated that the tracks did not go beyond the back of the house.  The tracks led up to the back bathroom window and the kitchen window like something was looking into his house.  His mother would not let the children play outside in the snow for a long time after that. There were no photos taken of the tracks.  The area is rugged and full of mountains.  The family had a garden on an elevated level area behind the house.  Beyond the garden, the hill behind his house is at least a sixty degree slope.  The witness stated that no people would ever decide to walk up or down the mountain and this is why the story is so odd.  The mountain is to the South of the house. There are no houses or roads on the mountain.  The second incident happened in 1993 or 1994 when the witness was back home visiting his parents.  He stated that he was on the side porch with his father around 10:30 or 11pm in late summer or early fall.  Suddenly, he heard  crunching and cracking coming down the steep mountain behind his house.  The witness is a hunter and knows the sounds of game animals.  He states that the gait sounded like a large human was steadily walking down the mountain and stopped at the tree line just above the garden.  The witness states that the outside light was on, but he could not see who or what was making the noise.  He further stated that when the sounds of walking stopped, it sounded like it was shuffling around in the same place for a few seconds before shuffling through the leaves and heading back up the steep hillside. The witness states  that his sister had a similar experience, although he could not provide details.  The area to the north is now being mined as a mountain top removal project and that he cannot personally relate any recent activity in the area.  Because of the tracks coming down a steep mountain after a snowfall, as well as the night incident of something walking to his tree line and returning up the steep mountain in the dark without the aid of a flashlight, this incident is classified as a type B.
