            "Observed": "My sighting of what I believe to have been a sasquatch was quite brief, though I did get a decent look.  My mother and I were visiting my aunt and I was asked to go out to the car to get my mother's cigarettes.  I went outside and walked over to the car and grabbed the cigarettes.  When I got back out of the car and went to close the door, I noticed something moving in the field next to my aunt's property.  A very large and definitely bipedal animal was walking down the field towards the woods.  It walked with a long and sort of slouched gait.  It was either covered with really dark brown or black fur and had rather long arms that swung loosely as it moved.  It crossed the distance of at least 200 feet in less than 20 seconds.  As soon as it reached the woods, I walked into the house and must have sat  for at least half an hour trying to process what I'd seen.  I was only 13 at the time.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. The distance was over a hundred yards but the witness stated that he could clearly see the animal. The animal was dark brown in color, seven feet tall and very heavily built. It appeared to have weighed about four hundred pounds. The animal did not turn and look at the witness but just walked through the field and back into the woods.  He was never able to see the face.  ",

            "Observed": "I have never told anyone this, except my husband ( who never did believe me, he knows something happened but he can't wrap his mind around this possibility ) for fear of ridicule. I was alone when this occurred and I am finally reporting this incident 40 years later, more for my own piece of mind than for anything else. This memory is as clear today as it was the day it happened and still makes the back of my neck hair stand on end. Perhaps it will allow someone else to know that others are out there who've had an experience that can't be easily explained. This happened in Southern Illinois outside of the small rural community of Prairie du Rocher, a town that is over 200 years old. There is a great deal of wooded area, especially along the bluffs, large tree stands that follow along the Mississippi River and somewhat inland in very thick stands between the Illinois and Missouri bluffs, on up to the tops of the bluffs on both sides. It is a sparsely populated area. There is a great deal of wildlife there, a huge deer population exists and they are big and fat from all the corn and wheat fields. At the time of this incident we had horses which were being kept at a farm about three miles away from our house, up on top of the bluff on 17 acres of fenced pasture surrounded by woodland and cornfields. The land had a pond and several sinkholes, one which was present across from the old original French house which was vacant. This particular sink hole was approximately six feet deep in the center tapering up to about 2 feet along the edges. The inside of the hole had a profuse growth of young oak, maple and other hardwood trees that were approximately 4 to 5 years old and about twenty feet tall. ( The trees stood exposed out of the sink hole at a minimum of 12 to 14 feet in height.) The barn sat to the right of the house about 300 yards away and the horses were standing nearby. I had come up in late afternoon, probably sometime after 7 pm to the farm to feed and check on my two horses, and had planned to make camp between the house and the sinkhole and spend the night. I did not want to stay inside the house because of the fear of spiders and snakes. My husband was gone for the weekend and I wanted to get up early the next morning to go riding. I had my German Shepherd dog with me. I built my fire and put bacon on to fry and made a small pot of coffee.",
