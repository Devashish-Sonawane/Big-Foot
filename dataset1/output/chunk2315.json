We had been there for about half an hour when we started hearing a whoop whoop sound and then some lound knocking like two tree trunks being banged together. We both made comments about what it might be but thought much of it. While I was browsing your site I found the recordings. I listened to the whoop and knock on that one recording and almost fell out of my chair. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HEARD!!! The whoop and the knocks were identical to those sounds we heard just above and behind us. It was that far from us but there was a hill that kept us from seeing anything. It was completely wooded in the area the sound came from.",

He then stated they began to hear whoops and knocks of what sounded like heavy wood on wood back in the woodline.  He stated after the whoops and knocks ceased the fish started to bite.  Report #8819Report #5342The witness states the whoops and knocking he and his friend heard sounded very much like  this vocalization from the Sierra Sounds CD.",
