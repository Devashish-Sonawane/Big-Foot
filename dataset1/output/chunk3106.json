When we crossed the creek (near where it empties into the ocean), to get to the north & rugged end of the beach, my dog--who normally runs a block ahead of me--froze.  She did NOT wish to walk anywhere in this area.  We turned around and took a walk on the south beach.  At 7:15 p.m., heading up the path to the parking lot, I happened to glance up at the steep hills on the north.  I was stunned to see what appeared to be 2 very large men--both dressed completely in black.  I looked again to determine if they were a threat to me, and saw they were, in fact, covered in black, and it probably wasn't dark clothing.  The figures walked in a hunched-over posture, one right in front of the other, arms swinging like apes, and taking very long strides.  They seemed to see me and appeared to be coming toward me.  I started to run to my Chevy Blazer.  Part-way there, I turned to see if I was being pursued--only to make eye-contact with a large doe (perhaps less than 100' away).",
