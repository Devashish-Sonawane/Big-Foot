            "Observed": "My grandson and I had driven up to East Fork Lake to take pictures of deer. They come out in the evening to graze near the lake. We took a few photos of the deer then decided to leave because it was getting dark. As we were leaving the park (two lane road with heavy woods on both sides of road), I had been talking to him (he was driving and I was in the passenger seat) when I turned my head forward and noticed something a short distance in front of us next to the side of the road. There was something tall and very dark that was hard to make out. As we slowly passed it I could finally see it and realize it was a Sasquatch. It was very large with a chest about 3 feet wide and stood about 7 to 8 feet tall. It was not moving, it was just standing there looking down the road from whence we had just come. I said to my grandson \"what was that\u0094 and he could not answer. We kept driving out of the park too afraid to turn around and go back. It had come out of the woods and was probably getting ready to cross into the heavy woods across the road. That animal was huge and looked very powerful. I was shocked because it is a busy park but with a lot of deer and people with picnics. I forgot to mention it was late, somewhere around 8 PM, the sun had already gone down but we were still able to make out object from the twilight.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with the witness on the phone on Friday 9/17 and met with her and her grandson on Saturday 9/18 at the sighting location. She and her grandson had been to East Fork State Park to photograph deer in a grove near the beach. When leaving the park at approximately 8-8:15 PM, grandson driving the vehicle, noticed a tall object on the right side of the road from about 150 ft. which he attributed to a cedar tree. From this point he continued to drive looking out for deer.She didn't notice the object until it was approximately 10 to 15 ft. in front of the vehicle and approximately 3 ft. off the side of the road on the passenger side. In her report she estimated it was between 7-8 ft. tall and couldn't see the face/top of it as they rode by. From the passenger seat where she was sitting, the top of the line of sight was approximately 6'10''-7' (give or take 6\" depending on the exact location of the subject and the location of the car in proximity to the edge of the road). Photo of the curve they were rounding that evening as they were leaving the park, rounding the curve they were heading SW:This photo is approximately where the grandson first noticed the shape and assumed it was a tree. Their vehicle that you can see is in the approximate location of where the figure was:This photo illustrates how close the treeline is to the road:In this photo we are attempting to determine the possible height, I'm standing approximately the same distance off the road as where the figure stood:",
