Prong Alafia River when it was splashing and she thought it was possibly bathing. The witness has read gorilla or ape-like descriptions in reports but when it made eye contact with her she saw a very human-like face. Lighter colored skin was seen thru the dark brown/black hair, especially on the chest.  The body was muscular, shoulders and chest were \"massive\" and it had a thin waistline.  Descending from generations of central Floridians, she grew up hearing stories of the skunk ape.I went to the bridge despite thirty years have passed.  We take this now very busy SR37 south to the beach and I wanted to take a look. The steel guard rails on the bridge she remembered looking thru and holding on to have been replaced with concrete barrier rails. ",
