            "Follow-Up Report": "Subject interviewed on property Sept 25, 2011.  She reported that she and her husband have heard vocalizations from the wooded portion of their property in the previous months.Additionally, a relative had a visual encounter while hunting the property approximately 10 days prior (to be submitted as another report).  She reports seeing a large, upright, bipedal figure moving across her property.  The distance was some 40 yards away & was lit only by her neighbor's porch light, some 60-80 yards behind the animal in question.  She said she only saw it \"for a few seconds\", but was sure about it being \"upright and bipedal\".  She states she was sure it was not any other known large animal including a bear, cow, horse, etc. She is not able to give any further description of the animal's features due to the poor lighting.Subject reported measuring a single footprint at 14 inches in length and 7 inches wide. The track was left on a road where a known game trail crosses it.  The soil is quite sandy.  I was shown the footprint found some days later that was poorly formed when viewed.  Considering the length of time passed, it was difficult to accurately assess the print.  A possible nesting area was also assessed. It consisted of three small cedars that appear to have been pulled towards each other forming an area of about 6-7 feet across.  Additionally, a game camera photo showing eyeshine was reviewed.  It is interesting to note that the height of the eyeshine is considerably higher and some distance behind the feeder, far enough to be beyond the camera's flash.  The distance between the eyes would rule out any of the usual suspects.  The area surrounding the feeder is level and I would estimate the height of the eyes above the ground to be about seven feet and possibly six to eight inches between the eyes.",
