            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the actual witness at length 3/10/10. She reported the incident occurred in early September 2009. She was not sure of the actual date. She was driving alone at night going home. The animal was standing near a curve in the road at the end of a long straight. Eyes reflecting like cat eyes made her slow down nearing the curve. The headlights illuminated not a deer but a bipedal creature covered in brown hair standing off the road. The road was a single lane, giving her a very good look from about 10 feet away. It was over six feet tall, exactly how tall could not be estimated. She thought it was standing on the slope of the ditch, so it could have been between 6 and 7 feet tall. It watched her drive past. She was certain they made eye contact and reported it exposed its teeth, in either a smile or warning display. The teeth were all pointed, looking much like a mouth full of canine incisors. She reported the face was not hair covered. It looked sort of human, with a wide nose, but not gorilla like. The skin color was dark-not black. she described seeing an Eskimo once on TV who had the same skin tone. The eyebrows were very bushy. The nostrils were flared. The animal watched her drive by until out of sight. She thought it turned its head, not pivoting its upper body as in some other sighting reports. She got the impression it was intelligent. She did not feel threatened until after passing the creature. Once clear of the immediate area, a strong sense of fear overcame her. March 1, 2010, a second sighting within \u00bd mile of the first one. This time the daughter of this original witness had a sighting of what seemed to be the same creature. Her sighting was during daylight hours.I advised the witness and her husband to look at the BFRO website at their first opportunity. During the conversation about the website, I mentioned there are recordings of howls and whoops from other areas. She asked if I could describe the whooping sound. I vocalized two examples for her and she reported they have heard those sounds during the fall and winter. Her husband overheard my vocalization and immediately said, \u0093That's it!\u0094In conclusion, the witness gave a very good description of her sighting, with no hesitation. This level of detail and fluidity of conversation leads me to believe she was describing a living creature previously unknown to her. ",

The creek I was coming down is deep in some parts and shallow in some. There are always deer and turkey moving through. When I came around the curve in the creek a splash happened right in front of me. I thought it may have been a fish. So I kept paddling. Then three more splashes hit by me. The last splash I saw it was a rock. So I slowed down in the creek to look. I started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees like a person would. Then it stood up. When it stood up. The hair on back of my neck did. Me and it made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It turned and started running through the woods. I've seen and heard people run through the woods. Its stride was wider than any humans. When it ran it didn't bother dogging sticks and stuff. It just ran through the brush. After that I turned around and started paddling back to my truck. I went back down there that night to see if I could spot light it. I done a howl and waited to see if it would respond. But than I heard two knocks back to back. I knocked on a tree. It knocked back at me. But it was off in the distance. So I couldn't see it.",
