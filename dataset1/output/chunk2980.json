            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness just a few weeks after her posting. She sat on this event for 4 years before coming forward.She was driving northbound on hwy. 67 here in Missouri. Hwy. 67 cuts right down the middle of the Mark Twain National Forest, which has roughly 1.5 million acres. It was 5pm and a clear sunny day. She was in the far right lane of a 4 lane hwy. She first saw the creature come in to view from the left side of the road and it was at \"full running speed\". She was about \"a quarter mile away and I slowed right away from 60 mph to 35 (appx)\". \" The head was tucked in and down in a runners stance, like any sprinter you would see in sports\". The \"back was quite arched and it ran on all fours and it was running faster than any human could have\". There was no tail and she did catch a glimpse of an ear and the ear \"was shiny black\".She was adamant that it was on its feet and hands, not knees and hands. It had \"dark brown hair that was 3-4 inches long and it was flowing as it ran\". \"It never looked my way, kept its head tucked down looking only at the road\". There is heavy forest on both sides of the hwy. When she saw it, it was running at the same speed and never slowed to look either direction on the 4 lane hwy.The entire event lasted 6-10 seconds, though the sighting (crossing the road) was in the 2-3 second range. The remainder of the time was it coming into and disappearing from view. She had an excellent and unobstructed view for those 2-3 seconds.She initially thought (immediately after the event) that since it was April 1st, someone was playing a trick for April Fools day. Was it a person in a monkey suit? Why would they do this on a busy hwy.? It took her awhile to wrap her head around it, and decided to keep quiet until school was finished. It only took a few days of research to determine what she saw, and more importantly, what she DIDN\"T see. She was aware of the probable existence but never looked into it until now. She scoured the internet and BFRO.net. No doubt in her mind now.",

He has spent a great deal of time in the woods, both professionally and for recreation. He is familiar with the tracks of all the wildlife in the area, including bears. Being 'Bear Aware' is part of his job with the Idaho Fish and Game, he's a Wildlife Biologist. He felt the consistent stride of the track line, including stepping through a creek and stepping up a five foot embankment without breaking stride, would be difficult for a man to duplicate. He believed, based on the size and depth of the tracks, they could only have been made by something very tall and very heavy, heavier than a moose.  The witness had been out of state fighting fires for a few months prior to finding the footprints.  Shortly after he returned from fighting forest fires, he learned that while he was gone there had been several Bigfoot sightings in the area. The witness is an experienced outdoorsman and believable.  These tracks are consistent with other tracks thought to be made by a Bigfoot.",
