            "Observed": "Driving home from taking my kids to school. The area is very wooded, lots of wildlife (deer, wild pigs, armadillo). I was driving on 450 and was slowing down to turn on to Old Avinger Road when I saw something move just behind the first line of trees on my right. It was tall and black, definitely not any of the previously mentioned animals. The deep black color is what made it stand out to me because although the area is wooded it was sunny out and the black color looked out of place with all the other shadows. It's size and color made it stick out. When I slowed to look more it ran into the wooded area fast, not on 4 legs. It was definitely upright and on 2 thick legs. I couldn't see its entire body. What I saw was at least 5 to 6 feet above the edge of the road, and the ground were it was standing is 2 to 3 feet lower than the road.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, Melody Flores, by phone.  She is a 34 year old caretaker for seniors. Her husband is a construction worker. She lives roughly 3 miles from this location and drives by it a few times each day. She was slowing down to make a left turn, and she then slowed down even more when she spotted the figure on the right side. That's when it ran off. She is certain she saw this tall figure standing just inside the treeline and then running back into the woods when she slowed down. She could not make out details but she is certain that it was not a deer or horse or any other large animal. I asked where she usually sees deer herds while driving through the area along the same route. She said she sees them near Old Avinger Road but never along the larger 450 Route.  Interestingly, the position where she saw the figure standing appears to provide an excellent strategic view looking down a long stretch of Old Avinger Road, where deer would be crossing or walking along, especially in the mornings.I'm calling this a Class B report because she didn't get a clear look at it, but the factors she observed suggests it was most likely a sasquatch, by process of elimination.For discussion about this report, see Facebook post and comments: https://bit.ly/3lDFxlR.",

After we barbequed we found it difficult to move about the campsite because of the huge rocks everywhere. I actually slipped and banged my knee on one of those boulders. I was in a small tent and my son Ron slept in the Ford Tempo.  He is a sound sleeper.  I am not.  During the night he awoke me and said something was moving around in the blackness outside his car.  I told him to go back to sleep and it was cold so I bundled up and tried to sleep despite the pain from my banged knee.  Right as the sun came up I heard the loudest scream right outside my tent.   It was inhuman - much louder than a man's voice and of an alarming intensity and pitch.  I unflapped one of the tent windows and looked out, expecting to see I knew not what.  Everything was sunny and looked normal. A frightening experience.",
