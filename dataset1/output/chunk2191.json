The area is remote, set between a railroad, the lava flows, and a highway. There are no recreational areas in the immediate vicinity. He informed me that he hasn't been back to the same spot since, but that the brush there is quite thick and, like many areas with past volcanic activity, it boasts caves.He doubts the animal was a cougar or bear, based on its behavior and scream. The witness has entertained the possibility it may have been a bum trying to scare them off. He remarked that there was no smell, something commonly, though not always, associated with sasquatch encounters. Being followed by one is by not very unusual, nor is being screamed at. If the animal involved was a sasquatch, it is possible this behavior was territorial, based on the apparent display that drove them off. It is also possible that it was testing them, trying to gauge their reactions.",
