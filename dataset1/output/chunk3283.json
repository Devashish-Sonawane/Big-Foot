            "Follow-Up Report": "I phoned the Witness and as we talked for a while on a number of subjects. The witness reports that twice during the early 1980's he heard a large animal moving around in the Lebanon State Forest in the Pine Barrens region while bowhunting. Both times he was with family or friends who also heard the animal. His informal inquiry of fellow hunters in the area turns up other encounters, but no sightings or footprints. The witness indicated that the very sandy soil does not hold prints well. The encounters typically consist of are extremely loud vocalizations, accompanied by footsteps and something very large walking through the woods, but staying just out of sight. The vocalizations are shrill, high pitched screams that are beyond the capability of a human. The witness described it as being louder than someone yelling through a megaphone. Both his encounters were w/in 15 miles of the Batsto River, which flows through the Pine Barrens and is the site of numerous other encounters. The witness recalled that on the first encounter when while deer hunting he heard something screaming while he was in a treestand. The animal paralleled his retreat from the woods and would run when he ran while continuing to scream. Upon reaching a clearing, the Witness turned to see what was paralleling/following him but saw nothing. He had the definite feeling he was being stalked. The animal followed him to the edge of the woods 400 yds to the road where his vehicle was parked. His hunting companion was at the vehicle, also heard the vocalizations and was concerned for the witness' safety. Both men were reportedly extremely frightened. The Witness is an avid hunter with 35 yrs experience. Hunting all over the US and Canada. No smells were reported. He reports that he has never heard anything like those screams, nor anything even remotely as loud. Both encounters occurred starting in late afternoon in October. Middlesex County is about 35 miles north as the crow flies. See similar report investigated earlier this month from Middlesex County. ",
