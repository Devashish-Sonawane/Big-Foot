            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and I discussed this encounter over the phone.  I found the witness to be very credible, and a knowledgeable outdoorsman.  He was able to help me locate the exact spot using Google Earth.  The area is very densely forested.  I will go out to the site when the snow melts.  There have been other reports from that general area. Report #23614 The behavior described is consistent with other encounters.  The noteworthy points of this report are the vocals, circling around the witness and his friend, and the large rock that was thrown into the road behind their vehicle.I asked the witness to describe the vocals. He said that it whooped three times then ended the call with a sound that we would describe as \u0093giving someone the raspberries\u0094.  This sound has been recorded over in Grays Harbor County by investigator David Ellis more than once.  The whooping sounds were the same as we recorded at the 2009 Olympic expedition.  Of further interest is that the creature making the vocalizations kept it up for about 45 minutes.The witness was parked at a wide spot where an old overgrown skid road branches off to the northeast.  The road lays in a north-south orientation. From where the witness parked, the sounds started to the southwest, and came from close enough that they were able to hear it walking in the woods. As the creature called, it moved north, then east, in a clockwise direction, crossing the road in the dark.  It was both dark and foggy, so they couldn\u0092t see it, but they could hear it.  Then it continued to circle them, ending up on the east side of the road.  It is very unlikely that a bear or other big-game animal would circle two grown men while vocalizing. As the witness wrote, the creature threw a large boulder into the road behind the truck. The boulder was described as being 24 x 12 x 12 inches in size. He said it was too heavy for one person to move.  He and his friend had to work together to get it out of the way.  He said that the impact marks were fresh, and that it could not have been there when they drove in because it would have blocked their path.  There is no other animal out there that could pick up and throw a rock, let alone something as big as this boulder.  To sum up: we have vocalizations the same as we have heard in other places; we have circling which indicates intelligence; and we have the picking up and throwing of a large boulder, which shows size, opposable thumbs, and strength.  These factors leave no other conclusion but that these two hunters were in contact with a sasquatch.",
