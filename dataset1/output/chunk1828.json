            "Follow-Up Report": "Fellow investigator Cindy Caddell and I, Jerod Caddell, responded to corresponding reports submitted by witnesses Larry on 8/19/2012 and Marc on 8/21/2012 regarding howls that were recorded on 8/17/2012 in the Tillamook State Forest of Oregon. Cindy conducted an initial telephone interview with Larry and he emailed us the recorded howls, which were compelling. Larry and Marc agreed to meet Cindy and I where they recorded the howl vocalizations so we could investigate the area.On 9/02/2012 Cindy and I met both witnesses at the location in the Tillamook State Forest. The area was quiet, and for the most part secluded. It was also geographically located in a \u0093bowl\u0094 surrounded by gravel roads and thick forests. We walked with them around the campground and noted the healthy forest, dense undergrowth, plentiful water sources and numerous edible plants and berries in the area. There were also numerous game trails and several signs of elk and deer. Bear scat was located on one of the trails. Larry stated that he is an avid bow hunter with years of experience in the Oregon wilderness. He can track animals and easily differentiate between sounds made by indigenous animals. Marc stated he was an avid outdoorsman with a wealth of climbing and backpacking experience. Both witnesses appeared to be credible and what they recorded sounded like genuine evidence.  Larry explained that his daughter had been camping with friends at the location the weekend before the howls were recorded and told him that she heard howls on two successive nights. The first night she (and a group of six others) heard calls that lasted for 20 minutes and the second night she heard calls that lasted for three minutes. Both witnesses, along with Marc's daughter, went to the same camp the following weekend (8/17-19) and began conducting their own investigation hoping to record what Larry's daughter had heard. While at the camp, there were no other campers in the campground and the next closest campground was miles away. At around 2100 hours, Larry, Marc, and Marc's  daughter walked the roads around the campground. One of the roads was bordered with power lines and they did a series of knocks on one of the wooden poles at the top of a ridge surrounding their camp. There was initially no response to the knocks.  At approximately 2215 hours, after arriving back at their camp, they suddenly heard a series of wood knocks in rapid succession that sounded close. Marc quickly turned on his camera, which has a video/audio feature, hoping to record the wood knocks. It was at this time when two howls came from the northeast that seemed to be in response to the wood knocking they just heard and Marc's camera recorded them. Larry and Marc said the howls were close to camp and they were able to feel reverberation through their bodies from the force of the howls. Larry stated that he was positive the howls were not from any animal he has ever heard in the wild before.  * Marc & Larry's Audio Recording * On 09/29/2012, Cindy and I conducted our own investigation of the area, along with the witnesses, and set up our camp near the original location. There were no other campers in the campground and any activity on the roads or trails in the area would be heard in the camp from a long distance away. The thick woods and undergrowth surrounding the camp would make it difficult for anyone to sneak in without being heard.  After taking an initial walk around the campground, we set up two digital recorders on the outskirts of the camp about 50 yards away. The night was clear and cold, approximately 40 degrees, and there were no signs of other people in the area.  The digital recorders were activated at approximately 2030 hours.  At 2142 hours, Cindy did a series of \u0093whoop\u0094 calls.  About one and a half minutes later, there were several higher pitched howls from a distance of a quarter to a half mile from camp. Those calls were answered by a series of deeper pitched howls from the top of a ridge further away. The howls seemed to be a form of communication and they went back and forth for approximately two minutes. The howls were recorded on two separate digital recorders and were also clearly heard by all of us in the camp. * Investigators' Audio Recording *There was no other activity noticed by anyone for the remainder of the night, but the recorded audio from that night revealed branches being broken, wood knocks, and the sound of tapping. These sounds started 30 minutes after we heard the howl calls and continued sporadically for several hours. Cindy sent the audio recordings to an experienced audio technician who works with BFRO investigators. The technician cleaned up the recordings and thinks the sound of breaking branches was made by large branches being snapped and thinks that the tapping sound was the sound of rocks being tapped together.  Summary: The witness' claims were validated by us having the same type of experience in the same area and being able to capture audio evidence in our own recording. The howls we heard and recorded did not sound like any of the common animals found in the area and were similar to suspected sasquatch vocalizations documented in other regions. ",
