            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a retired firefighter and bigfoot enthusiast. After reading about Report #31680 near his home  he went  looking in the woods for possible evidence. He hiked on and off the trails. While doing so, he came upon a strange and unnatural branch formation. He took photos and a GPS reading. This is one of the photos he took:Google earth image of the location:Stick structure formations are structured arrangements of tree branches, stones, and even skeletal remains that appear to be markers or symbols, and are believed to be constructed by Sasquatches to communicate to other Sasquatches. They are often found where there is bigfoot activity.  Arrangements can be in the form of branches placed together in a tipi-like cone, a series of stones stacked in a column, saplings twisted; bent at right angles and pointing in a specific direction, or bones often arranged in geometric patterns. After reviewing four photos he sent, I met him several days later at the park. The witness has a very respectful regard to nature, spends a lot of time hiking, and is very aware of his surroundings. He is familiar with the trails and took me right to the possible stick formation.  This formation is about 100 yards off the trail, and would have been easy to miss if the witness had not been looking for such evidence.  When looking at the formation in person, it is evident that it did not occur naturally. The large dead stick in the middle did not come from breaking off above or near the structure. It was deliberately placed there. Another sapling was bent under two branches; this could not have happened without a strong force. It took both the witness and I pulling on it together to disengage and reposition it. It is a very interesting formation, similar to others that have been documented. Heavy leaf litter prevents foot prints. Bulow Creek State Park is 5,600 acres of first growth oak forest.  It has one of the oldest oaks in Florida \u0096 a 700 year old tree. It is a unique spot in Florida, as there are not many Live Oak forests left in Florida. There are springs, creeks, and numerous types of wildlife. It is prime habitat for Sasquatch and could support them.  *UPDATE May 2012* The witness contacted me again on May 22, 2012 with information on additional findings. I met him at the park. There are several live trees with trunks approximately 1 3/4\" - 2\", broken at about 48\" off the ground. The trees are twisted not cut. The trees were in the same vicinity (within 100 yards) and lying broken in different directions. This damage was not wind related. It would take great force to break these trees. See photos: Also noted was what appeared to be compression marks related to the possible striking (wood knocking) of palm trees ranging in height of 4  - 10 ft on the trees. This type of \"damage\" to the trunks of the trees was noted only after the witness had hit the trees himself trying to get a squatch response. He began to notice that the same type marks he left, appeared much higher on other trees. See photos:Also discovered was a palm frond stuffed up a hollow oak. See photo:*UPDATE August 2012*We keep finding possible evidence of sasquatch in this park. The latest discovery is what appears to be a \"bedding area\" or \"shelter\". See photo:Floor of the possible bedding area:It has several trees bent over it with moss, palmettos, and broken branches that are formed into an \"igloo\" shape. Everything in the area is pulled or bent towards it. The branches are obviously put there as is the moss that is woven throughout. Palmetto fronds cover it, and a few are on the ground like a rug. One has to bend down to go inside the round opening, but once inside an 8 ft body could lie down. It is not a natural occurrence. Twisted, broken trees (at the 6 ft+ level from different angles) encircle the rounded base. No branches are cut.When the witness discovered the site he was totally \u0093creeped out\u0094 and didn\u0092t feel that he should stay in the area. He took a few photos and immediately left but did visit it again later. I crawled around inside trying to find hair or prints, but found none. As it would be, the night before I visited the site, a major thunderstorm blew through the area.  No prints, hair or odors were detected and it didn't appear to be currently used, possibly an old shelter.Looking out of the possible shelter:Less than a month after its discovery the BFRO received an early morning road crossing sighting at the SW end of this park, about 8 miles away from this location. The marshy-woods are all interconnected in this area.*UPDATE October 2012*On October 16, 2012 several palmetto fronds were found to be in a woven pattern. See photo:The branches were all broken, not cut, and woven into a \"tic, tac, toe\" pattern. It is highly unlikely anything could fall naturally into this pattern when the trees the fronds came from are low growing and several feet away. The off-trail, remote location makes it even more unlikely a person did this.  The investigation continues and updates will be added.",

It is an open hammock containing old growth liveoaks with a lot of surrounding history from the sugarmill period all the way back to the first native americans that inhabited the area thousands of years ago. I was \"off trail\" approximately several hundred yards when I came upon an un-natural looking intertwined tree formation capped off with a dead \"y\" shaped branch weaved in the top. I tried to think of how this could have occurred naturally but it simply could not have. I marked the site and took pictures and basically forgot about it until I read a report of an encounter in the same area by some local fishermen. I now wonder if it is a navigation or territory marker of some kind.",
