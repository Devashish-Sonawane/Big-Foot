A stray dog that hangs around the yard, (who is normally very mild mannered and inattentive), displayed signs of stalking something and being very on edge. He was growling and nervous, and took off after something unseen. All of the neighborhood dogs continued to howl and bark throughout the night.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness on the phone and got the following details.  The witness and her husband were traveling down a dark country road in the early evening of October 18th, 2018.  She was always on the lookout for deer in the road; as a safety precaution against auto accidents.  Everything happened very quickly, but she saw it standing on the side of the road, and then taking two strides across the road in front of them at a distance of 75 to 100 feet away.  At first, she thought it was a deer until she realized it was walking on two legs.  She described it as a walking tree.  It had a huge girth and she said if it was a person, she would describe it as being physically fit.  Although she mostly saw the legs and torso, it was nothing like a human due to its size and color.  She described it as being grayish brown like a flat earthy tone.  The headlights illuminated mostly its upper legs to the torso. She could not see all the way to the feet.  The witness did say that she saw it move its torso towards them where she got a glimpse of a lighter patch on the head area, which she assumed was a face.  The witness said that the creature propelled itself as if casually doing a fast walk.  The entire episode lasted 3 to 5 seconds.   The husband was on the phone talking and didn\u0092t get a good look at it.  He only saw movement and shadows crossing the road, slowing down as his wife yelled to turn on the brights.",
