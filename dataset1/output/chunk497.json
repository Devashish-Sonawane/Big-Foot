            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the reporter for close to 45 minutes regarding the encounter she had. She is part of a Northern California paranormal group and they were in the area investigating the report of a bigfoot seen playing with a local man's horses. She was driven to the area and could not remember the exact location but stated that it was outside of Covelo and had a large stand of trees nearby. The group, consisting of about 10 people, disappeared into the tree line with flashlights hoping to find the animal while she stayed behind in a car (the last in a line of about 4 cars). She stated that she was seated in the front seat on the passenger side playing tetris with sound off when out of the corner of her eye she saw a golden tan color move to the back window on the driver side. She never heard animal approach car. She turned in her seat and looked directly at the animal and as she moved it stepped back a couple of feet. She says she was clearly able to see the chest/belly area as the animal was standing close to the door. She turned off the light and shined flashlight light in the direction of the animal but only saw the lights reflection on glass. Th reporter says she then sat in dark for 3-4 minutes very scared and then turned the light back on and began to play her game again. Within a minute the animal returned to the same spot and this time patted the door twice with it hand. She immediately turned the light off and the animal steps back again out of sight. She then decided to not turn the light back on. About 10 min. later she began to see the lights of the party on top of the hill. This was when she saw the animal run past the drivers side of the car very fast \"much faster than a human ever could; a bear could never run that fast on two legs and it wasn't a horse or a big cat\". She told members of the returning party but they dismissed her accounts saying that she \"hadn't been with the group long enough to be taken seriously\". She returned with a few people the next day and they looked for tracks but found none as the cars had all driven over the spot where the incident had occurred. The investigator has consented to have her report published with the caveat that certain personal information be removed to conceal her identity and the location. ",
