            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with this witness on the phone on October 7th 2014. Later I met him in-person at the Sasquatch Summit on November 22nd 2014, and then the next day I met him at his residence to see the actual location and get a better feel for what had happened.Talking to this witness on the phone, he generally told me the same thing as is on his written report.  However, he also told of seeing a reddish colored sasquatch cross the road when he was traveling the Moclips Highway in 2005.While at his residence, I asked the witness to walk me through the events and indicate where the creature was and where he was at the time. The house is oriented generally north-south, with the back facing west. The witness came out of his house and went to the northwest corner to get his pots. The dog was barking from the property to the northwest of his property across a green-belt. The distance through the green-belt was about 40 feet to the neighbor\u0092s property. The distance from the house to the brush is only about 15 feet. The witness grabbed his pots, and then shouted at the dog to shut up. At this moment, the bushes started to shake and something very large growled at him loudly from only about 7 feet inside the brush. He said that he could feel the vibration go through him from the growl. Although the witness could not see it directly due to the thick brush, he could tell that it moved in a south-westerly direction. The witness commented that its bi-pedal steps seemed to shake the ground. The witness made a dash for the shed at the south-west corner of the house and grabbed a sledge hammer for protection. After what seemed like three minutes standing there, he was about to make a dash for his porch and the back-door, when the creature started moving through the brush on the south side of his house. He was quite upset, and stayed in place until it was quiet, and then ran to the house to get his shotgun. He said that he smelled no odor, as the wind was blowing away from him. However a few days later, he smelled a very bad odor, which by his description was quite like what other people, including myself have smelled in the presence of a sasquatch. His house is surrounded on three sides by very heavy coastal brush. The lots to the north and south are undeveloped and there is the green-belt behind his house. Also, to the south is a very large lot that is undeveloped. There are plenty of places to hide in the area, as this type of coastal brush is very dense. There are also a lot of deer, which are unafraid of people. The people there who I have talked-to claim that there are fewer raccoons than there used to be, although I did see a bob-tailed raccoon cross the road right in front of me only a few blocks from this witnesses home that day in daylight.This is the fourth report from this general area. Three are BFRO submissions, this one, Report #41111, Report #40381, and one that was reported to one of the other witnesses, who passed it on to me. (This report the witness does not wish to formally report). These reports are for the time of year from October through March. This indicates to me that this could likely be a wintering area. It should also be noted that although when viewed using Google Earth this area looks very developed, probably 2/3 of the homes are seasonal dwellings that are unoccupied this time of year. If you drive through the area at night you can see that it is very dark. This would enable unseen movement from place to place. ",

            "Observed": "I live in Albuquerque New Mexico in the summer of 1998 during the September elk Hunt I had an experence while stalking for elk with a hunting buddy of mine I had the feeling something was near but could not tell what. I stopped and waited for a while but nothing when we started do walk again we heard a very loud and low growl and I mean a loud and low growl near by. I have been hunting far a long time now and have been in the wilderness since I was a boy and have never heard anything like this it scared my partner very much and since I was the only one armed with a firearm he did not leave my side for the rest of the day. I had an idea of what it was but kept it to myself and did not want to scare my friend more I told him it was just a bull in heat as their was cattle all through the area he kind of believed me when we got back to camp we kept the enconter to ourselves. A few other things happened that week the next day we found a bear hunting dog in camp he was very scared of something and very hungry we tried to get hold of him to check his collar but he would have nothing of it he would stay close to camp but not close enough to get him we finally had to leave him there. Also the next day I kept my eyes and ears open some of the elk rubs did not look right not till a couple of years later did I connect what I was seeing some of the them where tree twists not scrapes like an elk would do reading some books I have read say that sasquatch mark there territory this way. In 2000 I was deer hunting this time with most of the same people not in the same area while sitting around the fire I just happen to say something about bigfoot some of the people laughed but some did not so I took a chance and told them about 1998 hunting trip that night I found out the night before I got there the hunting party heard some loud screams and moans from the hill nearby it scarred them enough that they all armed themselves. Some of them to this day still do not believe but I have played a recording of sasquatch sounds for some of them and they say that was it. I know that New Mexico would not seem bigfoot country most people think of it as all desert but it is not we have one of the largest elk populations in the country and lately we are having more sittings where I herd the growl is not far from the Colorado border and two other sittings in southern NM near Ruidoso which has a large elk heard. I know what I heard and it was not anything I have heard before not a bear or big cat or a bull it almost sounded human and very powerfull it thrilled me and scare me but I know it is real and out there to think other wise would not be sensable.",
