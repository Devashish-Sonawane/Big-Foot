            "Observed": "Last  September a friend and I went to scout a place to deerhunt up close to the Pee Dee River.I am disabled from a heavy equipment accident and i needed to kill deer to feed my son and me so we were trying to find a place that i could hunt and be comfortable and not too hard for me to access.We noticed a strong smell and my friend has hunted this place 30 years and i ask him if he had ever smelled anything like it and he said no.Opening day of regular gun season on October I parked my truck at the gate and my friend went by boat to his stand.As I was going in I noticed that stinking smell again as I got to my stand it sounded like something was following me the whole time on the way in there and it sounded like someone hitting trees with baseball bats.I hunted there everyday a lot of times by myself one day going to my stand I saw one just one track about 23 inches long and it was compacted in the ground about 2 inches I weigh 300 lbs. and my track only went down about half an inch. I contacted John Shaw with the N.C Wildlife Resource Commision he a Biologist he came down and met me and i showed him the track he said he could see what i was saying but the track was contaminated so we left it at that. About 2 weeks later i was hunting a stream right down from this spot and heard a huge splash in the water and i thought it was a deer so i waited,but never saw anything about 20 minutes later I went up the creek a few hundred feet and in a place in the creek I saw 1 track again on a rock bottom creek very hard my track didn't show up when i crossed the creek but this track 20 plus inches was down about an inch into the hard rockbed bottom of the creek since it was only one track again I didn't bother calling the biologist back,but i saw other signs like stick formations,large patches of vegetation that looked like it had been rolled over by a steam roller,several tracks in the leaves with long strides about 4 feet,found where 2 animals had been killed looked like something put a deer up on a big limb about 8 feet of the ground you coud see the deer hide all over the limb and found where an animal had just been freshly killed one day hunting in there was only person up there that day and something killed an animal near the river it looked like a pile of manure had been steamed rolled into about a four foot wide area on the road about eight feet long and a lot of blood on the ground but no guts and no corpse and that strange smell was there every day.I have hunted a lot of places since i was 5 years old I am 44 now,but this is the only place i have ever hunted that gives me the creeps,I know of a few sighting close to this place,it's not far from the highway 220 incident yall reported and not too far from where the one in Montgomery county was spotted.I don't care to be interviewed by the media please but i believe I can show you where you can actually find Bigfoot",

I was driving my 18 wheeler and it was about 8 p.m. I had my brights on and a car was approaching so i dimmed the lights. After the car had passed by I turned the brights back on... I couldn't believe at first what I saw. I had never heard of a blonde bigfoot but there it was. It was 7 feet tall or so and crossed a clearing in the woods that was at least 15 feet wide in two steps with a normal stride,not running, just out for a stroll. It never looked my way. This took place in Fruitdale Alabama on a Friday night in February of 2008. I have learned that this creature has been seen for years close to this area.",
