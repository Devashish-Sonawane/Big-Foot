            "Follow-Up Report": "Last heard the vocalization three years ago. Fence broken down was about 3' tall, made of multiple strands of barbed wire. Sound of fence being broken was about 50 yards ahead of him and a friend. Witness reported it definitely ran on two legsWitness and three friends had a subsequent sighting near Cranberry Glades in 2006, on the road leading away from the Glades viewing area. Creature was squatted down near a pine tree, standing to depart the area when illuminated by car lights. Eyes reflected orange, creature was about 8 feet tall with arms hanging below its knees. Hair was gray colored, almost white. Sighting lasted around 3 seconds.During the BFRO's 2005 West Virginia expedition a team of three people (Mel Skahan - WA, Bill & Julia - DC) went to an area near the Glades Wilderness and heard what they said were distinct sound responses.  The following year Dr. Taylor from Florida got a decent footprint cast from this same area.",

This investigator has worked with drug-addicted convicts and anti-social juveniles who often will lie to an interviewer.  In my opinion, this boy was being honest and straightforward.  Local neighbors who have known him over time believe his story.When asked to pinpoint the date in reference to Valentine's day, the witness said it was before Valentine's day, making it before the actual date of the full moon but while the moon was bright.Investigator Tim Cullen passed away in 2007.  He was a property appraiser and experienced hunter and woodsman.  He worked this sighting with Vince Lauria as a new BFRO field investigator for the Southeast, but later left the BFRO.In 2007 Vince Lauria revisited this location. The forests have been extensively logged, yet two \"wood knocks\" were heard just before dark from two different directions.  One came from just over a now thinly forested hill and the other from a wooded swamp, one seeming to answer the other, as if warning of my presence.",
