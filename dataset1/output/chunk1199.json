            "Follow-Up Report": "I accompanied the witness to the location of the sighting and interviewed her at length about her experience. She was traveling north on Hwy 75 towards Helen, just after sundown on Thanksgiving night, 1999. Hers was the only vehicle in the vicinity at the time. As she drove over a small rise, her headlights pointed down the road and illuminated a large, bipedal figure beginning to cross the road. Upon seeing the figure, she slammed on the brakes and slowed to a stop to within a few yards of it. It strode across the road swinging its arms as it walked. It had stopped in mid-stride as she approached it, and froze, arms extended. It stood completely still momentarily, then slowly turned its head toward her, and looked directly at her vehicle. After several seconds of it standing and staring towards her, it took a few steps and leaped down the embankment in the direction it was initially traveling (West to East). The animal was completely illuminated by her headlights. She described it as much taller than an average person, covered in dark hair, with little to no hair on its face. She described the color of its skin as a light gray/brown. Its build was lean and muscular, not overly robust or bulky. The sighting took place in an area where a prominent creek passes under the road. The creature had climbed up the left embankment from the creek, and followed it across to the right embankment. There are other reports from the area of sasquatches sighted along these waterways.Click the image below for a larger version.",

            "Observed": "My two friends and I were camping near Busick, NC, just east of the Smokey Mountain National Park.   We were northeest of Asheville, near the Blue Ridge Parkway.    (Busick is so small that google earth does not have a marker for it.)   On the first of the two nights we were there, we heard wierd yells going through the woods right after dark.   Later, while we were sitting near the campfire playing dominos, we heard the same yell and heard rustling in the woods nearby.   We couldn't distinguish what it was because there were some people singing christian hymns at a small theatre nearby.   Later that night, when I was asleep, my friends(they were brothers) were talking about the upcoming wedding of one of them this coming spring and the younger brother says that he saw it move through the woods very close to our camp.   He told me about it the next day and I got kind of scared, since I may have seen a bigfoot in New Mexico back in 1994 while in the boy scouts.   The next day the two brothers went on a long hike and I stayed in camp since I was experiencing foot problems and had no hiking boots.    I got really bored so I decided to walk down what seemed to be a game trail into the woods for a few hundred yards.   I noticed that there were a lot of trees that were broken, like something had bended them.   None of these trees were very thick, but there were a few that I knew I could not snap.   I started to get a little scared, like something wasn't right.   I was only about a 1/4 mile from the campground, and I saw it.   It scared the s**t out of me.   I only saw it for about 10-15 seconds(maybe, I was so scared it could've been 5 seconds or it could have been a minute), and the best way to describe it would be that it looked like the bigfoot from Harry and the Hendersons only it was heavier and a little bit darker.   I was probably about 15-30 feet from it when I saw it.   We stared at each other for the duration of my sighting, and then it walked away as if I wasn't anything to worry about.    I stood in that spot for a little while and then walked back to the campsite, stopping every now and then to look around for the thing.   I told my friends about it and after describing the thing the one brother who saw it the night before said that it was probably the same thing he saw.",
