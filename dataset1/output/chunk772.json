            "Follow-Up Report": "We met the witness at the location of the sighting. The witness was fishing late at night as he does frequently. He was lying down on a folding lounge chair. His backyard is surrounded by tall weeds that boarder the RR tracks that run directly behind his house, and stretch over the river to the Wildlife Management Area on the other side of the river.The pier (dock) is on a small lagoon that leads to the Caloosahatchee River. When he first heard the creature he thought it was a raccoon. As the noise persisted, he got up to investigate. He slowly walked toward the sound and could make out something above his young 6' palm tree just a few steps from his back door. As he approached, he inadvertently triggered the motion sensor on his backdoor security light and could now see the culprit. It was standing behind the palm tree and he could see the face was that of an ape-like animal with a hairy, man-like body. It had long arms, but because it was behind the palm tree, he got the best view of only its face. He described it as more ape than man. The nose more like an ape as it was upturned instead of hooded. The hair was dark brown, he didn't see any ears, the skin on its cheeks and forehead was dark and weathered. It was bobbing back and forth, and making grunting noises. It seemed agitated and nervous. Its mouth was slightly open, but he doesn't recall any long fangs. When he realized this thing was not something he was familiar with, he turned and headed for the house. As he was headed for the backdoor, it was headed for the RR tracks.Approximately a month later, he was fishing at a public pier 300 yards from his backyard when he overheard two teenagers talking about seeing the skunkape crossing the train trestle from the Caloosahatchee WMA to the mainland. This is a 500 yard walk across the river with four man made land bridges along the way. The water is only a few feet deep, except for the main waterway that runs through the furthest end. It would be about 12 feet deep. This area of Florida has a rich history of Skunkape sightings.",

We light firecrackers and the noises persisted all night into the morning. Then at about 8:00 A.M. the noises stopped and then we heard something large run on the opposing island. I went to investigate and somthing stank very bad. After walking around the island that we were staying on we saw many tracks some measuring up to 17-18 in.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Discussions with one of witnesses suggests large animal(s) moved around their camp site continuously throughout night. In morning two sets of large (largest \"twice the length of witnesses own shoed foot\")barefoot human-like tracks along with one to two smaller human-like tracks were discovered all around camp site and island. These tracks thought not to have been present evening before. Then, that morning a large animal charged through brush toward the two witnesses but was not visible due to thickness of cover. A terrible stench accompanied this charge. Witnesses were quite frightened by all of this and left island in haste. Scenario suggests BF family perhaps unhappy with presence of human visitors.Heavy rain later in day destroyed tracks.Area of occurance very wild and remote. Very credible witness. ",
