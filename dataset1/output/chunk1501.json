            "Observed": "I live in the very wooded hills of eastern kentucky. I noticed that some of my garbage behind my house had been ripped up, not reallly chewed up. Then one night about 2a.m. I let my dog out for the night and I saw him looking up the hollow(which is a very deep valley with a creek at bottom and about 4-5 caves surround the area). About 5 minutes later i heard him barking loudly like at something and i could tell, I went to the door and yelled for him to get back here thats when i heard him skuffle with something. I could not see him but, then suddenly he came running back fast and ran in the door. I then called my dad which lives right beside me and told him to bring his light and his gun something was outback trying fight the dogs. We started to walk up the hollow and heard really loud crashing and breaking of good size limbs, and also heard a grunting sound a couple time. They move for about 30 seconds very loudy breaking everything it sounded like, I heard alot of animal run in the woods but not any that just run right through the trees most animals will dodge the brush. We held the light up on the hill about 100 feet away for awhile all we heard was one constant sounds in the leaves right in front of us as something else walked around to the right of us. We left right after that because we didnt really hear anything anymore.",
