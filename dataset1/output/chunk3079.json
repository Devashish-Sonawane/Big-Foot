We came to a lookout,  and looked down on the lake. We saw what at first appeared to be two people standing in the high grass next to the lake,  with what looked like their dog.  They were standing still all next to each other,  as soon as my friend said,  \"Hey check out those people down there,\"  they heard us and started to run as fast as they could. At first they were running like kids,  jumping over logs, and through the swamp. One was larger than the other. Their arms were long.  As we watched them run I noticed that their pet was running just like a bear.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the reporting witness for about thirty minutes and learned a few additional details. First, the area where this sighting occurred is very remote. Heart Lake is a small (.3 miles across at its widest point) high mountain lake in the rugged St. Joe National Forest. The camping area mentioned in the report is an un-maintained rustic site that can be reached only by foot.The witnesses had hiked in about twelve miles to reach the cliffs above Heart Lake where they sighted the animals down below. The one I spoke to estimated the distance from where she stood to the three animals below was approximately 200 yards.She was still puzzled as to what this odd grouping really was. The two larger animals were definitely covered head-to-toe in brown fur, yet stood and moved on two legs as humans would. Unfortunately, she had no estimates of the sizes of the animals. From that distance she could only discern their sizes relative to each other. ",

It was around ten pm and we were in the middle of a lake when we had a rock thrown at us. It was thrown a good 150 yards from shore. Then about twenty minutes later as we back tracked to the car, we were in a small canal between two lakes and heard a strange noise that to me sounded like a cross between a gorilla and a duck. The noise was about 30 yards away from us. We heard it for about ten minutes and every time we shined our flashlights towards the sound,  we could not see anything. We had been sitting there for a while due to our canoe getting stuck on rocks.",
