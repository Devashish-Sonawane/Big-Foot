I was especially alert due to the large number of deer in the area. To the right of me I saw a flash of glowing eyes in my headlights. I slowed down and looked into my rear view mirror and saw what appeared to be the silhouette of a very large man. It had stepped into the road behind me and I could clearly see it because the moon was full and very bright. There were no other cars on the road so I began to stop to get a better look. This thing looked to be nearly as tall as a stop sign with very thick limbs. It was walking upright but slightly bent. It proceeded to cross the street and disappeared into the trees. I drove home awestruck with the image burned into my mind. I decided to only tell my boyfriend what I saw and as I was sketching it out he went online and found this web site. I'm not telling anyone else!",
