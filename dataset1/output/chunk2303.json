            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness by phone on 6/20 at 7 pm PST.  The following details can be added to his report:\u0095  The sounds came from the east.\u0095  The witness estimated the coyotes were several hundred yards away, and the vocalizations came from further that same direction.  \u0095  The \u0093wow\u0094 vocalization was clear and high pitched.  It did not have a harsh quality like a roar or scream.  \u0095  The witness has experience in the forests of Arizona and has never heard sounds like these.  He has asked several hunter friends about these sounds, all of which drew a blank on what it could be.  \u0095  The witness \u0093thought hard about this\u0094 before reporting the vocalization, taking into consideration the ambiguous nature of sound reports.  Elk bugling (which coincides with breeding season) is most often heard in the Fall in this area, though they have been seen bugling as early as July.  The report\u0092s date is well outside of this time range.  This, combined with a rich history of sightings in the area, indicate a good possibility that these vocalizations were sasquatch related.
