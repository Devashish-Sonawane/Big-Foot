In summary:- The animal was about eight feet tall.- The animal weighed over 300 lbs. - The animal appeared very bulky and muscular.- Hair coloring was a uniform dark brown.- The witness was unsure of the distance to the animal, all he could determine is that he was close enough to tell that it was hair covered.  - The witness was unable to see the face, only seeing the back of the head.- The witness stated that because it was drizzling rain he was the only runner in the area.- The witness stated that his sighting was about a mile north on the Prairie Path from the parking area, which is across the street from the post office which is located at  801 W Algonquin Rd, Algonquin, Illinois 60102- The Prairie Path is 25.9 miles long and connects to other trails.
