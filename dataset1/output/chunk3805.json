            "Observed": "I was a boy scout attending scout camp in a camp that BSA own in McCall called Camp Morrison. My friend and I were walking back to our campsite which was called Camp Billyrice. It's right by the entrance to Camp Morrison. We were closer to camp Ida Haven at this point walking back from the waterfront. We stayed too late and it had gotten dark, as we passed over this stream I saw something off to the side. We stopped on the small bridge, and froze. I thought it was a guy in a Gilly suit at first, but he was crouched next to the stream slowly drinking water with his hand. he turned and looked at us then he stood up straight and I could see in the moonlight he was not in a Gilly suit, but covered in fur. He had really long arms and was at least 8 feet tall, maybe more. I could see the moonlight reflecting off his green eyes and for the whole minute or two that we stood frozen staring at each other he didn't blink once. Then he turned away, crouched back down, and continued slowly drinking with his hand. My friend and I got scared and ran off. We never told anyone because we were scared and thought no one would believe us. I didn't perceive him as a threat though, and I think he didn't perceive us as a threat either.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.The witness, a thirteen year old Boy Scout at the time, cannot recall if the date was in late June or mid July, 2007. He remembers the moon was bright and casting shadows. It was not windy.The figure he and his friend saw from the bridge was forty feet away. When it stood slowly, it was at least eight feet tall, stocky with a short torso and shoulders about three feet wide. In the moonlight it appeared dark brown to black and did not have hanging hair but bushy hair that covered any neck. It had long arms that extended to the knees. The thighs were the same length as from the knees down. The head was round. No ears, nose or teeth were seen. No strange odor was detected.Besides these details, the witness reports vivid memory of some other details. The eyes were very large but in proportion to the head. The eyes were green in the reflected moonlight. The figure had full lips that protruded far out. The witness saw a long thumb that was sticking out when the figure drank water with its hand. The witness was very confused about what he saw and did not go back to look for tracks. He and his friend mentioned it to Boy Scout leaders and they said it was a person in a ghillie suit or their imagination. The next day the witness did ask a few other Boy Scouts if they saw someone in a ghillie suit the evening before and all said no. Payette Lakes State Forest surrounds this area. The witness knows of one cave that can be seen from less than one-half mile away but never hiked to it. I found the witness credible. ",
