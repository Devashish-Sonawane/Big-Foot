            "Follow-Up Report": "Fort Stewart in Georgia is north of Savannah and about 30 miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean.  This large military reservation is full of wildlife, including alligators and pumas. The witness [Sgt. R.B.] had patrolled other parts of Fort Stewart many times at night over the course of seven years.  On many of those occasions he was alone on patrol.  He had never heard anything like this before, and heard of no other incidents from other soldiers/personnel on the base. When this incident happened, he and his unit were on patrol in a nearly inaccessible swampy section of the reservation where there are no roads.  RB had never been in this area before, and says no more than 3-4 people pass through this section each year.The stalking and circling of the soldiers went on for a while, in two phases, before the screaming and the tree fall.  Two screams were heard.  One a moment before the tree fall, and the second almost simultaneous with the tree fall.  The animal was heard running away right after the tree fall.  RB said it was obvious the screams were coming from a very large animal.  During the stalking and circling episodes the soldiers could hear that the animal was running on two legs.  It was running and circling the soldiers in the darkness, at high speed through the brush.  RB said his patrol group was intimidated by how fast the animal could move as it circled them repeatedly, just out of view.  The patrol wasn't carrying any bright lights or spotlights.  They only had small flashlights with red filter lenses for reading maps.  They weren't carrying any nightvision devices either.",
