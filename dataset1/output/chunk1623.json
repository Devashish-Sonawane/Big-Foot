            "Observed": "The appearance of the thing was just as I have seen on tv stories and descriptions I have heard of.  As far as the behavior of it, it was very shy as it appeared to not want to be seen.  My son and I had been deer hunting on a local farm.  When time came to leave, we met up and started back to my truck. About 50 yards down our path we heard something coming out of a cedar thicket and we both saw it.  It stood app. 8 feet tall and had long brown hair all over it.  We stopped and it stopped at the same time.  We didn't know what to say or do.  Then it just stepped back into the thicket and went away out of sight.  We got back to my truck as fast as we could, but we could hear something following us the whole time.  But it did stay completly out of sight.  I haven't told too many people about this, because they always laugh at us or start making jokes.  I know I'll never forget it as long as I live.  It was really scary.  That thing was huge.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "  I was able to talk with both the father and son by phone. Both said that it appeared they startled the creature. The creature was walking toward them on a path and gave a small jerk as it apparently sighted them.There was no associated odor with the creature. They described the hair as \"dirty brown, tangled looking\" and \"messed up\" (the father's words) and looking like it was \"in dreads\" (the son's description). Both witnesses said no facial details, such as eyes, ears , nose or mouth were visible due to the hair hanging down into its face. The father estimated the body hair to be about 8\" long. The arms hung to below knee level. The father estimated the weight to be 300+ pounds and described the build as \"bigger than the biggest football player\", but not fat. Neither could see anything to indicate gender, the son assumed it was male. The father said the creature's stance was \"very upright, not hunched over, almost at attention\". Both said that the creature quietly walked backwards until it came to the cedar where it turned and re-entered the thicket. The father described the creature's gait as being \"just like a man\". ",
