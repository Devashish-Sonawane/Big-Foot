THE AREA WAS A NEW HUNTING GROUND FOR US THAT WAS RECENTLY MADE ACCESSIBLE BY A LOGGING COMPANY. WE SPLIT UP AND BEGAN OUR AFTERNOON HUNT.I WENT DOWN A GAME TRAIL FOR A WHILE AND DECIDED TO RETURN TO A FORK IN THE GAME TRAIL TO HUNT A DIFFERENT AREA. AT THE FORK I NOTICED A DARK AREA IN A BRUSH PILE. I WAS CURIOUS AND DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE. WHAT I FOUND WAS WHAT APPEARED TO BE A HUT OF SOME KIND MADE OUT OF LIMBS AND BRUSH. THE DIRT FLOOR WAS DUG OUT BUT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DONE MY ANY TOOL. IT WAS A DRIZZLY DAY BUT THE HUT WAS PERFECTLY DRY. IT WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO ACCOMODATE AT LEAST FOUR MEN. I WENT TO LOCATE MY SONS TO SHOW THEM THIS HUT. BY THE TIME WE GOT TOGETHER IT WAS DARK.",

The dimensions of the structure were approximately 6' by 6' by almost 6' high. It incorporated a thick tree trunk into its perimeter and was very inconspicuous to outside viewers. Its floor was basically bare except for a small tree trunk partly embedded in the soil.  The location of the bower  was adjacent to the intersection of two game trails with elk and deer prints on them. The observed footprint was an estimated 18\" long. Photographs shown to me conveyed a good impression of the structure and its insides as well as  the footprint.",
