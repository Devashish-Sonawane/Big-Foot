At around 6pm there was a large bang on my front door. The door was locked, thank goodness.  I called 911 and told them that something banged on my door, and I was alone and scared.  I lived right next to the Mt. Hood National Forest.  No families lived there in the winter time.  If something happened to me no one would hear me scream.  I heard grunting.  I looked out onto my deck, through the windows and I saw those eyes.  It had to be huge animal. It was there watching me and I was watching it.  It blinked its eyes, but it was like the animal was frozen with its eyes set on me.  It had a furry head.",

The witness states that frequently, when she came home, she had the distinct sensation of being observed. If a sasquatch was indeed coming around the property, it may have noticed that a lone woman lived in the building and presented no threat.The window she looked out of was about 10' off the ground and she looked slightly downward into the animal's eyes, about 8' away in near impenetrable winter darkness, faintly illuminated by a porch light. Nevertheless, she could only see the mesmerizing, slanted eyes staring at her with a bare indication of a hairy head and the large body hidden in the darkness.After the bang on the door, she heard what amounted to a very deep \"purring\" sound, a soft growl. She saw the eyes after an initial first look out of the window, closed the blinds, but subsequently pulled them aside and looked at the animal for an estimated 10 minutes, the animal not moving and barely blinking its eyes. Given the lay of the land, she estimates the height of the animal to have been about 8'.",

I originally took it for a tall tree stump or sprag until it began to move.  After it began moving I thought it may be a bear.  As I came closer, I realized that it was too thin and tall to be a bear.  Finally as I came within 75 feet of it, it sprinted across the road and disappeared into the trees.",
