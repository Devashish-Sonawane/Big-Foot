I enjoy hiking and camping on a regular basis year round. I have been considering submitting a report for my encounter over the last few months and finally I am doing it. My encounter happened about 4 months ago in July. My girlfriend and I were \"dispersed camping\" (which is where campers can legally set up a tent in the national forest for free for up to 14 days) in El Dorado National Forest off of Hwy 50, about 6 miles east of Bridal Veil Falls. We have a secluded spot we always return to on the bank of a 10-15 foot wide, 4-5 feet deep (at the deepest) river.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness' first encounter was of the sound of a large creature walking upstream towards his tent at midnight. He interpreted the sound to be made by a two-footed animal, but the nature of the animal is unknown because he did not visually see what was in the water.The following day he and his girlfriend witnessed two creatures near the tops of trees (one animal each in two adjacent trees) approximately 500 feet away. The top of one tree was snapped, although they did not see that action. The creatures were estimated to be 4 feet tall and about 100 pounds, they had neither visible ears nor snouts. The creatures were seen shimmying up to the highest part of each tree. Here is a photo of some bears in a tree:Witness took these photos and watched the animals for about 3 minutes. [Editors note: The BFRO is not stating that these are Bigfoots. We have received many photos of baby bears and porcupines in trees. Considering the area, the sounds they heard the night before, and the description of what the witnesses seen and attempted to capture in these photos - we thought the photos were interesting enough to share with the public.] We have received many reports of Bigfoots in trees, especially small ones. We are often reminding the participants on our expeditions to look up. ",
