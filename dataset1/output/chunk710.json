            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on April 8, 2007 and have the following to add:- During the encounter he was no more than \u0093twelve feet away\u0094 from the creature.- The animal appeared to be eight feet tall and \u0093very heavy.\u0094 He noticed the chest was very massive and approx. 2 and \u00bd feet wide. It was his opinion that the creature was a male  even though he could only see the figure from the waist up.- The witness related that he could \u0093see the pectoral muscles and chest clearly\u0085.it was a male.\u0094 He also noted that the hair was not long and was \u0093smoothed-down.\u0094 - Regarding the teeth, he went on to say it was almost as if the animal was grinning or smiling at him. That would be the best way to describe the position of the mouth.- The closest animal he could compare it to was a gorilla, except the face wasn\u0092t as flat and the head was \u0093more elongated rather than wide, but there was a lump on top of its head like a primate\u0085.I remember that very clearly\u0094.- Despite his close proximity to the creature, he did not notice any unusual smell.- He did not return to look for tracks or other evidence.- On a previous occasion at this site, the witness encountered a very loud animal sound. He said he couldn\u0092t quite classify the vocalization as a scream but he said whatever made it had tremendous volume and \u0093lung power\u0094 to it.Prior to concluding our interview the witness made reference to a footprint/track find in 1982 near Abbott Hill Road:See Report #2599According to the witness the prints found off Abbott Hill Road were only \u0093a few miles as the crow flies from where we were predator calling\u0094.",
