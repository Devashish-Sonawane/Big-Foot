            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness, JP, at the location of his sighting, two days after it had occurred. We could not find any prints on the trails near the sighting area, although there were numerous signs of other animals on the trails.While rounding a slight bend in the road, JP stated that the flash of eye-shine caught his attention and when he focused on the area, he saw the upper body of a massive, hair-covered biped standing on the edge of the woods. JP is adamant that it was not a bear or a human, and that it was not anything he had ever seen before except for the pictures of bigfoot he had seen on TV, and in books. JP stated that what he saw was over eight and a half feet tall, was covered in brown, neat, but short hair, and that he could see massive musculature definition beneath the hair. It had very broad shoulders and a conical head. Its eyes reflected a yellowish-orange glow in his headlights, which had originally caught his attention. After stopping, but not shutting off his car, he observed the creature from about 20 foot away as it stepped backwards into the brush. It did not try to run, but instead peered through the thicket, as if it were curious. This went on for about a minute, to a minute and a half, when JP stated that the only thing he could think to do was to call out, \u0093Hi\u0094. It was at this point that the creature backed further into the thicket and fled. There was no other traffic on the road during this encounter. JP stated that he could not make out any facial features other than the fact that its face did not have a lot of hair on it. And he could not guess a weight, other than it was \u0091huge\u0092. He had the  impression that it was male by the fact that the shoulders and chest were broader than the waist.JP stated that he did not hear anything except its escape into the thickets because his car was running, nor did he smell anything unusual. The location of the sighting was on the edge of a wooded area that has an active stream running through it. Surrounding the location are many recent housing developments that are interspersed with other wooded areas. There are active signs of game such as fish, raccoons, waterfowl, deer, coyote and turkey. It is connected via natural inland corridors to several large preserves and ranches, as well as several large inaccessible marshes, swamps, inlets and coastal wilderness corridors that border the shore of the coast. Although the area is recently developed, it is my thought that such a rich environment could be attractive to a bigfoot because of the recent and enduring drought that has plagued the area over the past ten to fifteen years. There are not many places in this county where there is an accessible fresh-water supply that is not surrounded by heavy development, except for the preserves and ranches. And even these have been known to have been so decimated by the drought that there are not many places that hold an active supply of water. Even JP, who I have found to be honest and forthright, questioned why the bigfoot he had seen would choose to visit such a highly populated area. But regardless, he is adamant about what he saw and stated that, \u0093It was big, it stood on two feet, it was covered in brown hair, and I don't know why it was here. But from what I saw, it was definately a bigfoot.\"",

According to Dale the tracks are distinct enough to distinguish from bear tracks. He said the trail appears to be repeatedly used. The watering hole mentioned is a spring on a hillside about a mile from Lewiston Lake. The surface area of the spring is about as big as a large table top. The morning Dale found the tracks the spring water appeared murky, as if it had been disturbed. On subsequent visits to the site the water was clear.I spoke with Dale's wife, who returned with Dale to the site with him the day he found the tracks. She confirmed his story.We'd like to talk to a photographer in this area who has a Camtrakker. The watering hole sounds like a decent spot.",
