            "Follow-Up Report": "The Grand Mesa, the largest flat-topped mountain in the world, is a lush oasis which rises to an elevation of 10,000 to 11,000 feet above the high desert of western Colorado. It is a rich landscape of dense forests of aspen, spruce and fir, large open meadows, over 300 lakes, abundant fish and game, comprises an area of approximately 500 square miles and reaches 40 miles east of Grand Junction. Far from the recreational pressures of the Front Range population, it provides a seemingly ideal possible habitat area.The witness stated that the source of the sounds was across the lake and to the east at an estimated distance of 3-400 yards. He noted that the source had to have a tremendous set of lungs to produce sounds of such volume and duration and estimated each vocalization as lasting for about twenty seconds. After firing a shot, the bellowing stopped briefly, but then it sounded as if it moved closer and seemed to get more belligerent and aggravated with even more commotion as it thrashed the brush and started \"yelling\" or \"screaming\" again. Although the witness did not admit this to his friend, he grew increasingly unnerved himself and did then consider the possibility that this might be a sasquatch because \"as long as it was going on, the more I deduced it couldn't be anything else\" and felt the message being communicated was \"like I wasn't supposed to be there.\" Although initially hesitant to do so upon first submitting this report, the witness, Richard Staats, gave permission to use his name and stands by his reported observations. As a lifelong hunter and fisherman, he has been \"out in the woods all my life\" but had never heard anything like this at any other time, before or since.  As a result of this incident, he has a lasting interest in this subject and continues his own study.David Petti",
