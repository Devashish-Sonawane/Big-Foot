On the night he was coming home from work, the rain was a light mist so visibility was still good.  It had a dead animal by its back leg and was dragging it.  He guessed the dead animal was a deer or a large goat, he knew of a goat farm nearby.  He estimated the creature was @ 400 lbs. and 7 - 8' tall.  The hair was light brown and 3 - 4\" long.The night in 1990, he and four of his friends saw a similar creature in the woods when they shined their flashlight on it.The brother's encounter occurred close to an apple orchard.  The bigfoot ran alongside the vehicle for 10 seconds.",

The animal had two to three inch long dark brown hair, very obvious muscle definition, and was noticeably bulky. Even though it was dark, he felt that he had made eye contact with it, and that it seemed more human-like than ape-like. He described the incident as very unexpected and bizarre.",
