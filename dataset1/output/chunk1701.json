I had to shovel out an area to park the van. I didn't go up the Williams road because the van was only two wheel drive and didn't want to get stuck in the snow.",

Elevation is above 8500 ft.We were at his cabin on Sunday but could not trout fish because of the snow for 2 1/2 days.Tues morning at about 7:30 I was standing at the front door of the cabin when I could see something black and walking upright heading for the aspen trees .I believe it was startled by a pickup truck comeing down this small dirt road. I ask my brother to look at this with the field glasses and I then look at it for several minutes as well as my brother.It looked to be about 7 to 8 ft tall and I estimated about 350 to 400 lbs. We went with a yard stick which is all we had to try and at least measure the foot print. It measured 17 inches long and 6 1/2 inches wide. We were going to track it for a while but the snow covered the tracks pretty good",
