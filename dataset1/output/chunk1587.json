            "Observed": "I got up one morning in August and decided to walk next door to my mother's home.  When I walked through the bedroom door, I noticed that she had a gun lying next to her on the bed.  She immediately began telling me that something had been outside her window the previous night.  She stated that she felt someone watching her and she then heard movement outside her bedroom window.  She then described a smell to me.  She said that it smelled like a cross between a wet dog and a \"pole cat\" (skunk).  I wasn't exactly sure what to think so I walked outside and began to look around.  Right outside of my mother's bedroom window was the most exact footprint.  I was shape like a human footprint but with no arch, like someone flat footed.  I measured the print and took photos.  It was 17 inches long and approximately 7 1/2 inches wide at the ball of the foot.  It was very distinct.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": " I spoke with the reporting witness and her mother by phone. She related that the hair found (which was not kept) was about two to three inches long. The color was brown with a reddish tint and the texture was similar to a Saint Bernard dog's hair. The foot print showed four toes clearly, including a big toe \"just like a person\", and gave a hint of a pinky toe. The pictures were sent to me, but did not show enough detail to be included with this report. The mother related that she was sleeping with a fan in her trailer window to draw in the cool night air. She awoke because of a strong odor \"worse than a skunk\". The smell was animal- like, but not like anything she had smelled before. She then heard something moving in the weeds behind the trailer, which prompted her to go get her gun. She said she heard the movement for about half an hour; the smell stayed in the trailer for the next hour and a half. She said that she did not hear anything touch the trailer during this incident. When asked about the \"unusual whistling noise\" her daughter had reported she related that had occurred about a year before the smell/footprint incident. She said that at dusk a \"nasal screaming whistle, not like you'd do with your mouth\" had come from the nearby woods. The sound only occurred once. She described it as \"eerie\". She lived in the location another year before she moved. There were no further incidents during this time although she reported that she often felt like she was being watched.",

            "Observed": "Camping out archery hunting with 19 year old son. Heard what sounded like non-descript mumbling outside tent. Thought I was hearing things, went to sleep. Woke to hear foot steps outside tent heading to truck, something rustled around in the truck, thought it was my son. I rolled over to see my son shaking inside his sleeping bag. Before I awoke to the footsteps, he heard at least two different vocalizing/mumbling sounds with walking around our tent. They stopped on my side and he heard a loud vocalization type talking and saw a large hand push in the side of the tent using three fingers, about 4-5 inches. I was snoring and my son thought this might have attracted them. We waited inside the tent for a couple hours and could hear movement outside. Nature called and we both went. I saw one standing behind the truck and he saw one duck behind a tree. We tried staying in the tent for another hour, but they wouldn't go away. I got up went to the truck started it; one was about 30 yards behind truck just watching. We grabbed the tent and everything in it and without breaking it down, threw it in the truck and left. This went on from 11:00pm until 4:00am when we left.",
