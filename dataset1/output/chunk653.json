            "Observed": "So I am an avid hunter and I used to hunt the Corps of Engineers land on the Texas side of the Red River. I was going to get my trail camera and check the pictures for any sign of wild hogs moving along the river and eating at the bait I had set up. When I pulled up to the parking area, I was the only truck there. It\u0092s hot in the summer and in those woods there is little breeze. It\u0092s about a 20 min walk through the woods to the camera. So I had navigated my way through the brush and had come around the old piece of original bridge supports and turned slightly north west and something yelled at me about 100 yards away, through the woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. His description of the encounter matched his written narrative. During our discussion, he added the following details. The sighting through his rifle scope lasted a second or less. The range was 50 to 100 yards; and if the animal had not been in the sun, he would probably not have seen it at all. The view was quartering away of a rear haunch down to above the ankle. The length of hair did not fit with animals he was familiar with in this part of Texas. The animal moved extremely fast and unlike the movement of bears that he had hunted previously in other parts of the country.The vocalization he heard was deep and powerful and like nothing he had heard before. He said that it was unlike any of the vocals he had heard on TV Bigfoot shows and that he had tried, but could not duplicate it with his voice.Finally, he said the sense of dread was very intense and that he has not returned to that area since the encounter. I found the witness to be very articulate, candid, and credible. He was a former marine with combat experience in Iraq and an avid hunter, well familiar with Texas wildlife. Although we mutually agreed that this encounter could have been another animal, the unusual vocalization, length of hair seen through the scope, and feeling of dread, to us, eliminate the usual suspects that live in this area.The Red River has a history of sightings, some of which I have investigated.",
