            "Observed.1  ": "And in the early-morning hours of June 5, Peeler told authorities, the creature \u0096 a Cleveland County version of Bigfoot \u0096 wandered onto Peeler\u0092s property in the rural northwest part of the county. The Cleveland County Sheriff\u0092s Office has filed the case as a \u0093suspicious person report\u0094 but says it is keeping an open mind. Peeler lives on Vanada Drive, northwest of the town of Casar. There is little or no civilization between his property and South Mountain State Park, one of North Carolina\u0092s least-developed recreational sites. He told deputies he heard screeching and grunting sounds, came outside his cabin, and saw the creature near his mountain home. Peeler told authorities he thought the creature might be menacing his dogs. \u0093I rough-talked him and said, \u0091You get away from here,\u0092 \u0094 he told NewsChannel 36, the Observer\u0092s news partner. Peeler, who said the creature had six fingers on each hand, told WCNC the Bigfoot left his property but came back a short time later. \u0093And I said, \u0091Get! Get!\u0092 And he went back down the path again,\u0094 Peeler told the TV station. These reports aren\u0092t new to Cleveland County, although it has been three decades since Knobby \u0096 the county\u0092s other well-publicized Bigfoot \u0096 was in the news. In the winter of 1978 and \u009279, a number of people in the area near Carpenter\u0092s Knob, north of Kings Mountain, reported seeing a large creature with long back hair, walking on two legs. Authorities surmised residents were seeing a large black bear, but the reports persisted. One property owner reported one of his goats died of a broken neck, and newspaper stories from the time report of manhunts \u0096 or Bigfoot hunts \u0096 by some of the area\u0092s braver residents. Those stories tell of large footprints being found, and of theories that the creature might have been a panther. Reports of the sightings died out in the spring of 1979, however. The sheriff\u0092s office says it patrols the area near Peeler\u0092s property regularly. \u0093If we see something, we\u0092ll try to capture it and take it into custody,\u0094 Sgt. Mark Self told NewsChannel 36. The sheriff\u0092s office says residents should use caution around any creatures \u0096 in case they find themselves dealing with a not-so-friendly bear.
