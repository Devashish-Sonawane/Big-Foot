            "Follow-Up Report": "I had a good talk with the witness, and he related without prompting the story he submitted.  He clairified some of the details of both the sighting and track find.He was hunting quail/pheasant on top of Badger Mountain, which is rather a large hill.  As he scanned the landscape to the southeast of the summit with binoculars (probably 7x35) he spotted a large hairy animal walking on two legs at a good pace.  It was walking away from him.  The color was dark brown to black.  The arms were in motion, and seemed longer in proportion than those of a human.  The witness emphasized a number of times that the animal he saw was basically the same as the subject in the Patterson film.The hair he estimated was 3 - 4 inches in length.  The distace from witness to subject animal was likely between  400 - 600 yards.  The witness felt quite certain in his description despite the distance.  When the animal started to run, the witness emphasized that it was at a speed no person could match.The witness added these observations about the track sighting when he was twelve.  The area was treed, though the leaves were down.  It had just snowed, and while hunting for rabbits he came upon a series of very large foot prints that lead into a big thicket.  He was a bit alarmed, and returned home.  Later he came back with friends, and together they could not find a way to duplicate the depth of the tracks.At the time the witness found the tracks, he had heard of bigfoot.The witness also related that a couple of years after he found the tracks, he overheard some other boys talking about an animal they saw while hunting rats at night by the light of car headlights.  This event took place at a garbage dump west  of Richland - on Bombing Range Road.  Apparently the boys reported that a large hairy animal stood up and ran off, away from the shooting.",
