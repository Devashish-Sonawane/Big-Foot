            "Observed": "My friend Marvin and I were on a double date with our girlfriends. We had planned to take them to an old collapsed train tunnel. We had gone there earlier to \"set up\" a little scare for them in the way of fake blood and an old torn shirt that we hung from a tree branch. I lot of teenagers hung out there on the weekends to party. No one I knew of had ever gone into the tunnel to where it had collapsed. There was about 10-12\" of standing water in the tunnel all the time and it was very dark inside. To access the removed railroad tracks leading up to the tunnel you had to go up a dirt road past a gas well and through some very deep brush. I made it up to within a quarter mile from the tunnel when I couldn't go any farther in my Ford Granada with its tall snow tires. It was about 11:00pm on a Thursday night. We all got out of the car and with one flashlight started for the tunnel. The area leading up to the tunnel is heavily wooded with high banks all the way around. We made it to the tunnel entrance conveniently shining the flashlight on the fake blood and the torn shirt creating a scream from the girls. My friend and I came clean with our prank and talked the girls into going on top of the tunnel opening with us. We climbed up the hill to the left of the opening and sat on top of the tunnel for awhile. I guess it was around midnight when we decided to leave. I didn't acknowledge what happened for the hour we were there then but the next day I realized how they were all connected. My girlfriend heard twigs snapping while we were sitting on the tunnel and I told her what did she expect we were in the woods.",

            "Observed": "We were driving at fifty mph and had been dodging frogs that were on the wet sunny highway. While going around a curve in the highway we came within 50' of a Sascquatch that was stooping in the middle of the road eating frogs. When he saw the car he stood straight up and ran across the highway and ran up a sheer rock wall that I'm sure that a deer could not make it up. He did not use his hands to climb with and the speed at which he could run and his display of strenght in climbing the wall frightened us both and I hit the gas hard to hurry and get passed the spot that he was at above us.",
