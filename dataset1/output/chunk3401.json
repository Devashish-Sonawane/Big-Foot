            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness over the phone.  He stated that he was camping in a remote section of the camping area at Land Between the Lakes in Western Kentucky.  It was mid-week and no other campers were present. Their camp was located near a fish cleaning station and the dumpster area.  On the first night of camping, he noticed that something hard hit his truck. He heard the metallic clang and brushed it off as a possible walnut falling.  Then he heard some sticks falling in the woods.  Again, he knew that branches fall out of trees all of the time and he did not think any more about it. On the second night, the couple was up late after talking to relatives in Russia.  They were just talking softly and settling down to go to sleep.  Suddenly his wife roused him and said she heard something moving outside in the forest.  They heard something come crashing downhill through the forest.  It made loud crashing sounds as it ran through the brush.  The witness jumped up and went outside to check with his flashlight.  He thought it sounded bipedal and quickly eliminated the idea of it being a deer or a bear.  As he scanned the forest with his light, all became quiet.  It was then that he described that he heard the sound of two exhales, almost like a sigh. Just as suddenly, the thing crashed back uphill through the woods making the same amount of ruckus as when it came down.  I asked him if it cleared the woods or if he ever caught a glimpse of it.  Although the woods opened up at the bottom toward the campground, it never came out of the thicker brush.  He further describes the sounds as an exhalation of breaths \u0093like you would hear from a large animal like a horse\u0094.The couple immediately began breaking down camp and tossing their gear into the car.  As it was beginning to get daylight, he noted that branches and sticks were broken five to six feet off the ground at the edge of the woods where he guessed it came down about eighty feet from his tent.  Furthermore, there were two slide marks where it suddenly came to a halt and slid sideways.  He described the slide marks like two \u0093tire- like\u0094 skids in the mud although you could see the marks were made by bare feet.  Upon leaving; they circled through the camp ground and verified that there were no other campers present; only empty RV\u0092s that were parked waiting for their weekend owners.As they were leaving the area, they stopped to talk to one of the volunteer campers further away.  They told him, without going into much detail, that they had been spooked last night and were cutting their trip short.  The volunteer just laughed and said, \u0093Well, they do say that strange things happen up here sometimes\u0094.",
