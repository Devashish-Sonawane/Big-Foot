            "Observed": "On my family's rural 3,200 acre se louisiana farm along the pearl river we found 16\" tracks in the sand dune from the lake then up a sand bank and over a flat area of sand, retreating down into the thick swamp. What startled us really wasn't the size but the stride! The stride was double our stride, the tracks appx were 8 ft apart!!! I believe in big foot and i know all we've ever seen was these tracks, but i know what i saw was not made by a human. My family has farmed this land since 1850 and never knew anyone to fake tracks. We keep tabs on who uses the property, mostly only family. We've heard strange sounds before, actually last was by me on nov. 15 2008 at 11:30 p.m. while hunting hogs at night. I thought it may have been a cougar, but after hearing similar sounds of primates, it may have been that type!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The first incident actually happened in 1988 when the witness was ten years old. His father and a friend were coon hunting on a calm clear night when they heard a sound described as \"a woman being mauled\", come from the direction of an old Indian mound on the property. In the summer of 1991 the witness's aunt came running up to the house talking about giant tracks down by the lake. Near the lake (one of a few on the property) they found tracks going straight up a steep thirty foot high sand bank. On top of the bank they found about fifty man-like footprints in the sand going towards a thick swampy area. The footprints were twice as wide as the witness' size 10 foot and about five inches longer. The stride was attempted by the Uncle who is 6'6\" and he could not get close.  In 2008 the witness was in a deer stand hunting wild hogs. Around 11:30 p.m. is when he heard a long howl from about an eighth of a mile away. He described it as similar to a howler monkey, yet siren-like, and assured me he has never heard anything like that in the woods before. He left the woods soon after that. This happened about a quarter-mile from where his father had an incident in 1988. The witness is a lifelong hunter and outdoorsman. He received his first shotgun at the age of five. He has spent countless hours in the wilderness and knows the sights and sounds of the woods. I found him to be an honest and sincere man. The 3200 acre property consists of raw southern wilderness and abuts the densely forested Pearl River. This wildlife corridor extends into the range of the legendary Honey Island Swamp Monster, which is about fifty miles to the south.",

My son has a fascination with science and more particularly earth sciences so I decided to show him the volcanic craters around Sunset Crater north of Flagstaff, Arizona and also to see the ancient ruins of Wapatki National Monument which is on the same road that breaks off of highway 89 and then rejoins it several miles north.",
