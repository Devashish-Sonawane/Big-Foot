When you reach Camp Horn Road, make a right.  Go about a quarter of a mile and make a left onto Eicher Road.  Go up Eicher road to where it forks, make a sharp left, go up that part and you will be on Roosevelt Road.  Now you will see straight ahead of you almost a very large hill, a long driveway with a small house at the top.  In the 1970's behind this house was a field with woods behind it.  That is where I heard those noises.  Now, make a right turn onto Roosevelt Road and drive up past the woods on your left, those are the woods my brother heard strange noises.  At that time the woods went back for miles behind the house, that is where he saw Chewbacca. I won't tell you which house it was we lived in, I have not been around there since 1980, and those people living there now don't want to be bothered, maybe they would even sue me.  For all I know, those woods have even been cut down.",
