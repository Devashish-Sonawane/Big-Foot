            "Follow-Up Report": "Excerpts of an interview with MM's son, JM, now 25.We were back on logging roads. My father was cutting away some of the brush and we were just walking up in the forest a little bit. We had really just started hunting and we're looking up in the trees for squirrels when we saw it.It was about 6 feet off the ground when it jumped out of the tree and all of a sudden it was just standing there, probably 10 feet away. It was the middle of the day. It was looking right at us.I don't know a lot about bigfoot but this one seemed small. It was a little bit taller than me and my cousin at the time.It was probably 5-6 feet tall. It was a little bigger than me as kid. It probably went 200 pounds; it was pretty bulky. It just looked a little bit surprised. I was just thinking to myself, it wasn't expecting us. It looked at us like, \"What are you doing here?\"I was terrified out of mind. It had long black hair on its arms but it didn't have a lot of hair on its face. It stood upright on two feet. I can tell you it wasn't a bear - it wasn't anything I'd ever seen before or since.It looked human with a whole lot of hair. I saw hands - four fingers and thumb; knees, elbows and feet a little bit like hobbit feet.I would say it was a little longer than normal human face. It didn't look like an ape's face. It was fairly human-looking. It was kind of like if you were to mix an ape and a man take a few features from each. It didn't look like a gorilla, but it wasn't like you and me. It's standing there on two feet and we're like \"Uh, what the hell is that?\" We just looked at it for a few seconds and I remember I asked (DZ) \"Should I shoot it?\"  It looked at us, we looked at it, and we ran.

            "Also Noticed": "After the screaming incident we were positive this couldn't be anything else. We tried to rationalize everything away but I truly believe this was a Sasquatch. Ive heard foxes, bobcats, mountain lions, bulls, ECT and nothing has ever sounded close. I've heard male lions call and the power in the call is the same but the sound is not. Also, I had a pretty strange emotional reaction. I had that happen a couple other times out there. Once while I was carrying in groceries not long after the night I heard the screaming.  I left the rest of the groceries in the car, went inside and locked the doors. I realized that my husband and I and also avoided looking out of any windows at night for quite a while before this incident. Strangely we never realized we were avoiding windows until after we moved. Even though all that time we were having to tell our kids there was nothing to be afraid of and that there was nothing looking in at them. This creeps me out to even think about now. It was almost like some sort of mind control or tranquilizing effect. It's very out of character for my husband and I to hide from anything. At the time it was like we didn't realize that we weren't spending time outside at dusk or dark. We would just think we wanted to go in. Thinking back on it now it seems very odd like we were being manipulated. We didn't stay out and have bonfires or catch fireflies. No one was really afraid either though. It's hard to explain the feeling. Writing about it now, my heart is beating hard remembering the sound, but the night after the calling I don't remember being afraid. More just kind of numb feeling.",
