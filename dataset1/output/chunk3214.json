            "Observed": "I was outside of the home where my 1st wife was raised at Dodge Point where her father owned some land. I was walking thru a patch of trees when I heard a loud stomping. At first I thought it may be horses running but realized that there were only two feet making the sound and not four.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I called and talked to the submitter of this report and found him to be a reliable witness. During our conversation I asked him how far away the creature was when he saw it and he replied that it was no more than seventy or seventy-five yards from where he was standing. I asked him what kind of trees it was shaking and he replied that they were either oak or elm trees. He said he didn't get to see the creature's  head \u0096 just the arm and shoulder \u0096 and that he only saw it briefly. I asked if the creature was hairy and he said it definitely had hair, which looked different than the leaves, and he said the hair was was dark and that its length was like that of a yak - not short like the fur of a dog. He estimated that the hair was four or five inches long and he said it was brown and stringy. He added \u0093leaves aren't stringy - it was hair\u0094. The submitter of the report told me that he thinks the tree-shaking was probably meant to try to scare him. He doesn't know if the loud stomping was also meant to scare him or why else it would have done that. He said the creature's actions could've been a way of saying \u0093we are out here too\u0094. He pointed out that in any case the creature was not trying to be stealthy during the incident.   The submitter of the report told me about tracks that were later found at the site of the incident. He said one track was more definite than the rest and he said it was similar to the ones he's seen on the \u0093Finding Bigfoot\u0094 television show. I asked him about the size of the tracks and he responded by saying he wears size fourteen shoes and that they were bigger and longer than his feet. The submitter of the report said the incident took place at around nine or ten o'clock in the morning and he said the weather at the time was beautiful. The sun was shining and there were blue skies.  He talked about the area were the incident occurred and he said the area is used for growing winter wheat and that there are canyons around the area. There are a couple of springs in the canyons that would be a water source for animals. There are old Native American Pueblo ruins not far from where the incident took place. The submitter of the report told me he was not only one who'd had an experience in the area. He said other people had witnessed things that they could not explain. I find it interesting that a few miles to the south of the location where the report took place there is a canyon called Devil Canyon, which is next to a mesa called Devil Mesa. It is thought that sometimes places with the word \u0093devil\u0094 in their name may be called that because of strange happenings in the location that could actually be bigfoot-related. It's hard to know if that may be the reason for the names here, but it could be the case.I believe there may be a lot of unreported sightings in this part of Utah where this report took place. There is a lot of potential Bigfoot habitat in the Abajo Mountains to the west of the site of this report, and I hope other reports will be submitted for this area in the future. ",
