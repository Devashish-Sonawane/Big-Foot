The witness was awake early on the morning of May 30th because of trouble sleeping, and at about 5 AM heard what was described as a series of vocalizations lasting 3-4 minutes.  The vocalizations were in succession to each other, and it sounded like there could have been more then one occurring at the same time.  They resembled the Ohio howl found on the BFRO website.  After being told about what was heard, the witness' husband proceeded to take his ATV in the direction of the howls, but eventually came to a fence and had to stop. The campsite was relatively deserted at this time.  Throughout the weekend prior, there was much activity going on, both day and night.  Nothing was heard during this time.  No other animals were heard to compare the howls to.  Also, no other signs were noticed during their stay at the campsite.",
