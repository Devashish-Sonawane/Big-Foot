            "Location Details ": "This is an area that I am very familiar with, have fished there many times, seen deer, bobcat and coyotes but nothing strange or never heard any strange sounds.Before I was born there were rumors of panthers in the area. Lots of wilderness in this area. Years ago, teenagers used to swim in the river.And people would throw out their trash, old mattresses or furniture there. About 10 years ago, the old dirt road was blocked and a new road was paved with a new bridge put over it and I used it quite frequently, but not everyday. The nearest house was probably 200 yards away.",

            "Observed": "I was traveling in my vehicle coming across a bridge with a well known river passing underneath, when I noticed a large tree that had fallen into the water off to the right about 200 yards.

As for the bridge where I saw this creature, I am not aware of any other incidents like this, but I know several people in the area and am going to make inquiries.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length regarding his sighting.  The sighting occurred on August 1st, circa 3-3:30 PM.  The witness was driving across the Jimmy Witherow Bridge heading into Murray County.  Midway across the bridge, the witness looked over to his right due to a half-submerged tree catching his attention.  Closer to the bridge, the witness spotted a bipedal figure bent-over, standing in the water.  It was holding something in its left hand.  The animal was standing about 20-25 feet from the bank of the river.When describing the animal, the witness stated that it was covered in long black (with some brown) hair.  The witness\u0092 first impression was that he was looking at a bear, but quickly realized that this wasn\u0092t the case.  He described the creature\u0092s facial features as being human-like and black in color.  The witness couldn\u0092t tell if the face was covered in hair or not; he did note however, that the individual had a wide, flat nose, and a \u0093protruding\u0094 brow.  The witness described the creature\u0092s build as being broad, heavy and muscular.  The witness was so captivated with looking at this individual, that he nearly ran into the bridge side wall.  The witness noted that a red vehicle was following behind him and that this vehicle slowed down, apparently to look, at the animal as well.",
