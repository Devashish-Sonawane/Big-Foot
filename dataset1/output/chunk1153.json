I questioned her about known animals in the area and quickly ruled those out.  She's had at least three other (subsequent) vocalizations from the same area  heard by other neighbors as well.  She was frightened at the thought of it being a possible sasquatch, but has learned a great deal about the subject over the past few months.  She has become quite comfortable with the idea now and is gaining knowledge at a rapid rate. She was encouraged to purchase an audio recorder if she'd like to possibly identify the source of the sounds.The BFRO has received several reports from Smith County.",
