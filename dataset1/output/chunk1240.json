            "Follow-Up Report": "I initially spoke with Eric on 11/09/2004.  He was very eager to speak with me and since this incident occurred has become very interested in Bigfoot/Sasquatch.  The vocalizations were very powerful and emanated from an area south of town, perhaps one mile away. He could not associate the sound with an animal or bird, nor was it mechanical in nature, such as from a train or firehouse siren.The area in question is very near similar reports from Murray, NY and Clarendon, NY.  The Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge is approximately 15 miles southwest and may offer suitable habitat to support a small family group.Eric also stated that his fianc\u00e9e\u0092s sons had a very recent sighting, which left them shaken.  The two boys are 11 and 14 years old.  They both had seen a large figure walking across a field at a distance of 150 yards.  At first they thought it was a hunter.  Then, they noticed it appeared to be covered with long fur.  The youngest boy called out and the figure stopped in mid-stride and looked at them.  At this point the youngest became spooked and frightened and ran to the house.  The older boy kept watching the figure as it continued to walk along a hedgerow for another 30 yards.They described the creature to Eric as a little over six feet tall, very broad shoulders, and covered with dark brown/black fur. I have asked Eric if he could encourage the brothers to submit a report.",

I knew that around the bend of the creek where the deep hole was there was lily pads, so I instructed my son to be very slow and quiet on our approach so not to spook any bass that may be feeding around them.",
