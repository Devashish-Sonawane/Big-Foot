            "Also Noticed": "As I stated above there was alot of logging going on. As a reult, it created it a creek bottom or bog at the back of a field where the forest started. My buddy and I would ride our bikes down there and watch the deer water/feed and sometimes catch glimpses of other animals. There was a drop off, due to the logging, so it was easy to stay out of sight. On this particular night, there were some does feeding/watering and tey jerked around looking behind them, up the hill, flagged and ran. We sat there waiting to see what spooked them and then we saw this creature walking upright across the hill, but downward, toward where the deer were. We had never, or since, seen an animal move with that kind of speed, with that kind of lazy movement. It was easy for it to had cover a couple hundred feet in the seconds it took us to recover from the shock of what we were seeing. It appearred to be at least 7 feet, maybe taller, but the strides were unbelievable. There was no noise. No step noise, no breathing, no nothing. Broad, muscular shoulders. Long, thick arms (almost knee length). Head looked smaller, almost out of proportion for the body. We got on our bikes and rode home as fast as possible. 14 year old boys, but we were still visibly upset and crying to my Mother over what we saw. It took about 20 years for the two of us to get to where we could talk about that day without getting chills up our spine. Neither of us has ever went back to that piece of property. My house was across the road from the property. I lived in that house for a few more months and refused to venture outside after dark, even with threats from my parents. My friend was the same way, but he lived 10 miles away.",
