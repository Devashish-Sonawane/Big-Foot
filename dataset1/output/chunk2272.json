            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness, she was 12 years-old when she had the encounter on a clear night with temperatures around 40 to 50 degrees outside. The witness lived in a trailer house near Evening Shade, MO off Highway 17. The surrounding area was very wooded, and was part of the Mark Twain National Forest. Her mother had left the witness at home alone whilst the mother traveled to pick up her stepfather from work. It was approximately 7 or 8 pm in the evening and dark outside when the witness had her encounter. The witness had been sitting on the couch alone when she noticed her dog\u0092s strange behavior. The dog was alerted and its attention was focused on the back door. Upon sniffing the air the dog\u0092s demeanor quickly turned from aggressive growling with hackles raised (which was quite unusual for the dog) to a terrified cowering retreat to the safety of the couch area. The witness looked toward the back door and saw a massive shadow from an upright being pass across the window of the back door and then across the two windows of the trailer\u0092s living room. The shadow was illuminated from behind by a pole light located approximately twenty-five feet behind the trailer. As the shadow passed the windows in a continuous movement, its mass filled the entire twenty-four inch wide window and reached vertically to the top of each window it passed. The witness could see only the outline as the back door\u0092s window consisted of privacy glass and the living room windows had shear curtains which allowed light transmission but prevented direct viewing. The witness recalled having seen her stepfather through the same windows but his 6'5\" stature reached only to the middle of the windows and he certainly didn\u0092t fill the window by comparison. The witness remembers thinking to herself regarding what she saw, \u0093that was huge.\u0094 No noises were heard when the subject passed by her trailer but immediately afterward she noticed a faint musty odor that lingered briefly. The witness was too scared to do anything but stay put on her couch until her parents returned home. Normally she would have gone to bed. But she instead waited for her parents company before she felt brave enough to venture down the hallway, past the back door and to her bedroom. Once in bed the witness could not sleep that night as she was still very affected by the encounter. The witness had no familiarity with the concept of bigfoot at the time of her encounter but approximately two weeks after she remembers children at school talking about the \u0093Momo.\u0094 The witness asked them what \u0093Momo\u0094 was and they described reported sightings of a big hair covered creature in Missouri which had become know as the Missouri Monster or Momo for short. She recalled her encounter upon hearing the description of this legendary Momo.",

            "Observed": "I saw a large black, human shaped figure in the middle of the road about 1/4 mile in front of my vehicle. From the distance it looked larger than a normal human.  When I first saw it I was going down a slight dip in the road.  It appeared that the figure was facing me, but as I approached descending into the dip in the road I could only see the upper body, it was turning and appeared to quickly retreat to the side of the road.  I lost sight because of the dip in the road but when I came up on the other side within about 2 seconds there was no trace of the figure.  The trees are trimmed back about 50 ft so I was surprised that I couldn't see what at the time I thought was a person.  When I got to the area where I thought the figure had entered the woods I slowed to look for it.  I saw nothing.  The woods are pine woods where you can see back under the branches clearly for over 100 ft.  The ground surface was icy with a very sparse snow falling.  I saw no tracks but that could be because of the ice.  It seemed strange to me that someone could exit the road through uneven slippery terrain and disappear before I could get close enough to see what it was.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and have the following to add to the report:The witness stressed several times how large the figure seemed, even from 1/4 mile away. It was all black and he could see no clothing breaks or color changes that would have indicated a person.He first saw it as it stood up facing him, as if it were startled by his approach. At this point, he clearly saw that it had long legs and arms, and was not a bear.As he drove down the hill into the dip that separated them, it turned and very quickly and fluidly moved off to the East. He noted that its head sat on its shoulders and was held forward at an angle. No neck was evident. He was especially impressed at how fast and fluid its movement was; though he could only see the upper body move off, because he was descending into the dip.He lost sight of the creature at the bottom of the dip, and when he came up on the other side, he could not see it anymore. The ditch leading from the road to the plantation of thirty-year-old Norway pines was covered in ice. He could not understand how it could have gotten across that icy ditch, into the pines, and be hidden as quickly as it did. He retraced the area in his car, but could find no sign of it, except for a garbage bag that had been ripped open. Grapefruit peels were scattered around the area of the bag. He never got out of his car, and the window was rolled up, so he did not hear or smell anything.The entire sighting lasted for about 10 seconds. The area around Sturgeon Lake is prime habitat, with large tracts of forest and bogs.When asked if it could have been a man, he said that he didn't think so. A neighbor had commented to him that there were Meth addicts in the area and perhaps that would explain why it ran and hid. The witness doubted this though, saying that it just didn't move like a person would and was very large. He had also inquired with the local game warden about the possibility of a bear, but they told him that the bears are not active this time of the year. He also discounted it being a bear because it had long limbs, it never dropped to all fours as it moved off, and it did not have a snout in profile.The witness is a fifty-year-old man who has spent his entire life in the woods. He was very unnerved by the experience and had had trouble sleeping for a few days afterward. I found him to be very credible and honest.",
