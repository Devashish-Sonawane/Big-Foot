            "Follow-Up Report": "I first discussed this report with the submitter who emphasized how adamant his mother was in consistently describing her observations many times over the years despite the occasional disbelief of others. He then obtained permission from her to discuss the incident with me as well. Her version of events was mostly consistent with the account submitted by her son but she was able to provide a few more details in her observations.The sighting took place in the early 1970s when the witness was about 15 or 16 years old. Access into the area is along Rock Creek, but the more precise location appears likely to be the valley and drainage just to the north along Pebble Creek and just off to the west of Forest Road 1351. The sighting was at the first beaver pond to be reached among the group of several that reach up this valley to the west.Riding along on the mini-bike with her nephew, who happened to be a few years older than her, they came out of the woods and into a clearing near the pond and suddenly upon this figure in front of them, no more than fifty feet away. She first thought it was a person but immediately dismissed that idea. She described a very clear sighting of this creature squatting pond-side, facing to the left, with its arms and hands between its legs and prominent knees, reaching down into the water. It was evenly covered in \"dirty greyish, off-white\" hair which was medium-length and not particularly thick. The only exception she saw in this coloring was around the face and eyes which appeared to be dark-colored. She said that the eyes appeared droopy and looked sad and that it had what looked like a beard. It turned to look at them as it stood up and it was at this point that she realized this creature was much larger than even a big man. Her nephew turned the mini-bike around hard and fast and she slipped off the back of it. As she was running to keep up and jump back on, she looked back once and the figure was already out of sight.She also mentioned if it was possible that this was an older creature, because of the coloring, but also wondered if it may have been somewhat deaf because she was surprised to have even come across it given that the vehicle they were riding was a bit noisy. It seemed to have not been aware of their presence until they came upon it.Upon returning to the cabin, they excitedly described what they had seen to other family members but were apparently not taken seriously.Although not certain that it was related, she did recall that, around the same general time period, a nearby rancher was troubled by an unusual number of sheep and goats being killed and gone missing.Growth and development has had a significant impact on this area, which is not far north of I-70, but occasional reports of sightings and other possibly related observations still continue. This location is on the eastern edge of the Gore Range and the Eagles Nest Wilderness with Vail on the western side.David Petti",
