At first, I think that it is a large man wearing dark, winter clothing.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, a business owner from Mazama, WA, for about 30 minutes over the phone. She has lived in this area for about 20 years and has driven the pass many times, but this was the first time she had seen anything like this. She was driving home eastbound from their business, which is on the west side of the pass, with her two children who were in the back seat. It was dusk.She stated that there was enough ambient light at the time (sunset time on this day for the region was at approximately 4:40pm) to see the figure without the headlights just yet.  The upright figure she first saw on the left side of the highway abut a 1/4 mile away was definitely not a bear, as she has seen bears up close in her yard. It was more vertical than anything else, so it could not have been a deer or elk. This looked like a very tall man, but was dark and all one color. She stated that it appeared to be facing her, but it was not close enough so she could see any details of the face. It appeared to be all very dark brown and with a lean build. She described the gully-type area to the left of the highway where it appeared as extremely steep and rocky. I am personally familiar with the area near Rainy Pass, having traveled it about a month before this sighting last year. The fluidity of movement that she described as it moved down and away from the road convinced her that this could not be a human, as she has never seen a person move so smoothly and quickly down such rugged terrain. She was so startled by what she saw that she wondered if she should stop, but reconsidered as she thought about her children. The witness stated that in trips across this pass more recently, she determined that the distance between the first figure seen and the second one was probably a bit greater than she had reported- more like 3 miles, than 2 as she had originally written. She mentioned that every time she goes by this area now, she recollects the experience and looks for more evidence of activity like this. After the first sighting, she continued driving, feeling kind of in shock, as she realized what she likely had likely just seen. Her children did not see the figure as they were in the back seat . Approximately 3 miles east, the area to the left of the highway was still steep gully-type terrain, and she saw another smaller dark figure, all one color, also lean, and also on the left side of the road. She could not tell if this figure was facing her, but it seemed slightly smaller than the one she had just seen previously, and it too suddenly \"flowed\" smoothly and lightning-fast down into the rocky gully. She said that unlike the other figure she saw, this one appeared to be doing something in the trees. There were small trees where it had been standing, and they were still moving from the figure's passing when she drove past that point. The gully was so steep a person would have had to turn around and climb down, rather than step forward down it.She was very shocked, especially since she now had two strange instances of very graceful, large, fast figures almost \"melting\" down a remote, steep slope in the middle of nowhere. There were no cars parked alongside the highway in this area, nor had she passed any for about 60 or 70 miles. Her children made no indication of seeing this figure, either.Based on the remoteness of the location, the witness' description of the two figures' appearance and extremely rapid and fluid movement, as well as the terrain, I believe the witness likely saw two sasquatches at this location along Highway 20.",

A trail to the summit begins at 1920-ft passing through dense, rainforest-like woods and climbs steadily for about 5 miles before emerging from the trees in a boulder strewn alpine cirque. By following a steep switchback up to a notch called Stujack Pass at 5720-ft, the rim of the cirque is reached which leads by way of an exposed ridge to the summit pyramid.",

            "Observed": "My partner and I summitted early in the afternoon of an overcast day. The familiar ascent had been particularly interesting in that we passed a herd of mountain goat with young that were grazing in the cirque meadow. We had also seen several marmots. After lunch and a nap on the summit we started down. We had descended through the Pass and were picking our way through boulders about halfway down the cirque when I turned and looked back up to where we had been a few minutes earlier. I noticed movement in the Pass. A large, dark, human-like form stood up and looked directly down at us. I stopped and asked my partner who was ahead of me, \"What's that figure up in the Pass?\" Neither of us spoke as we watched the form. The situation was very odd because we knew there was no one else on the upper mountain. Familiarity with the area and subsequent research indicates that there are no other routes to the Pass. It would be impossible to miss other hikers on the narrow exposed trail, not to mention the fact that at the outset ours was the only vehicle parked at the trail head. As we watched, the form began to vigorously wave its unusually long arms up and down and over its head. On speaking later of this odd behavior both my partner and I had clearly interpreted it to mean, \"Get the hell out of here!\" as opposed to, \"Hello there.\" The gesture was definitely felt as menacing. (Although I thought of the camera in my pack I was reluctant to take my eyes off the figure for fear I would miss something. We watched transfixed for a few more seconds until low clouds moved in to cover the Pass. We continued down through the woods to the trail head and, as when we had arrived, ours was the only vehicle at the trail head.",
