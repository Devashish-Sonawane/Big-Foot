            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness had a visual sighting of a bigfoot while riding as a passenger in his girlfriend\u0092s car on a clear, sunny summer day in 1999. The former girlfriend was not available for interview. The couple were driving eastbound on old Hwy 94, about 2.5 miles east of the Jefferson City Memorial Airport when the witness spotted the animal along the north/left side of the road, approximately 20 feet from the road on a plot of land that contains the foundation remains of a former residence. Directly behind the animal was a round bale of hay which the witness utilized for size reference. The sighting lasted only seconds. The animal was on its hands and knees, with its right arm lifted and extended forward and its left leg lifted and stretched back. It didn\u0092t move during the sighting except for its right hand which it appeared to be using to manipulate some object on the ground in front of it, as if it was exercising extreme care while picking something up. The animal was concentrating and its attention was completely consumed with whatever task it was engaged in, though the witness couldn\u0092t tell what exactly it was doing. The animal\u0092s back was nearly flush with the top of the round bale. Round hay bales vary in dimension but their diameters are typically between 5 to 7 ft.\tThe animal\u0092s features reminded the witness of a combination between the bigfoot depicted in the movie \u0093Harry and the Hendersons\u0094 and that from the Jack Links commercials. It had short beige colored facial hair. It had squinting dark eyes with a furrowed brow as it was intent on its task at hand. The nose looked flatter than a typical human nose. The body hair was loosely curly, clean and shiny; darker brown in color. Its hair had darker roots and lighter brown ends and looked like it was just combed, not matted. The hair on the side of the hips and buttocks held tighter curls and was described as a bit spiral. Witness re-emphasized several times during the interview that the hair was \u0093so shiny\u0094 and \u0093shinier than what you\u0092d expect.\u0094 The hair on its arms was straighter and hung down, blowing in the wind. The skin was dark in color. No neck was observed, just massive shoulders and then the head directly on top of the shoulders. The head was rounded like a humans without any prominent ridge. No ears were noticed. Once past, the witness exclaimed to his girlfriend, \u0093I just seen a bigfoot! Did you see that?\u0094 She wanted to turn the car around to better see it. The witness was fearful and insisted that she should not do that. The sighting area consists of river bottom farm fields punctuated by tree-lined creeks. Its bordered on the east by tall forested bluffs. The Missouri River is no more than a mile distance to the west. The witness also recalled a strange experience in 2006 while fishing from a boat on the Missouri River not far from the location of his 1999 sighting. At approximately 3 a.m. the witness started hearing grunting, snorting along the river bank. He could hear a large animal pacing back and forth crashing through brush and snapping sticks as though it was displeased by the witness' presence on the river. The witness said that the presence of bigfoot in the area was common knowledge among many inhabitants of Cedar City, a nearby town. Some of his relatives have had their own sightings, including his mother, aunt and grandmother in the early 1970's. The witness was sincere and credible in his account. I\u0092ve since been in contact with the witness' mother. I hope to publish her report and interview her as a separate sighting. The Missouri River corridor in this central part of the state has a history of producing bigfoot sightings and contains prime habitat as would be required to support an established bigfoot population.\t",

Both boys mentioned several times that trees in the vicinity of the Cyr Mine area where they periodically adventured into had large branches broken off about ten to twelve feet above the ground.  According to the witness, the boys often wondered how so many large branches could have been broken off so high above the ground, over such an extended period of time.  In addition, both boys noted that the large branches were broken off during the summer and fall months - when there was no snow and ice to cause the limb damage.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness at her cottage and we walked to the location where her vehicle had become stuck in the deep snow, and then traced her steps back to her cottage on Bass Lake. Along the way she pointed out the location of her neighbor\u0092s tracks heading toward their cottages along the road close to where her stuck vehicle had stopped. The witness then identified the distinct starting and stopping points of  the large, suspect tracks further up the road and where they eventually veered off the road in a northernly  direction into the swamp.  The witness explained in detail how the tracks made by the suspected Sasquatch were considerably larger (15 inches long, 8 inches wide), nearly in a straight line, and most importantly the distance between the individual footprints which, was very large - at least 4 feet. Also, the indents for each of the individual suspected tracks were clean, and the snow around the footprints was not disturbed like those made by the witness and her neighbors. (Deer, rabbits and other game tend to leave marks in deep snow because they have to drag their feet.) The witness and I also drove over to the Cyr Mine location southwest of her cottage to examine the area where her son and his friends years before - had frequently noticed large broken off branches ten to twelve feet high above the ground on several trees. The Cyr Mine location is in a densely wooded swamp area, teaming with wildlife including deer, geese and ducks.  Finally, the witness is a Registered Nurse who has worked in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan for approximately 40 years.  Therefore, she is used to dealing with various things in logical, matter-of-fact way.  In addition, her cottage has been in her family for generations, so she is very familiar with the wildlife that inhabits the local area.  The footprints that she saw in the snow were not made by one of the more familiar forms of wildlife.  Given the landscape and habitat where the prints were sighted, as well as their unique qualities tells me that they may have been made by a Sasquatch.",
