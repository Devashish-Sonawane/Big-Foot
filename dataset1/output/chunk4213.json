            "Observed.1  ": "While Grumley showed us this foot print, and that faded foot print, this pretty good print, and another that might have been a footprint.  It was Overlade who found the only print I would say showed great definition and looked authentic.  The prints, definitely were not made by a bear, and could not have been made by man because, it was a haphazard footprint, which appeared as if the owner of the foot was surprised and slipped.  He slipped breaking the humus-type top of the of the ground and leaving a print of a hurried and harried person, perfectly carved out of the decaying top layer of ground. \tThat footprint that Overlade found was in a campground and other lighter prints lead from it, about forty five to fifty inches apart.  The foot itself was possibly twice the normal man's foot in length and maybe twice the width.  It is the second time I have seen so-called bigfoot prints.  It looked like a real footprint of some huge animal but it was difficult to ascertain whether there was bone structure since the twigs in the other impressions defied further detection.   \tIt was reported, by Grumley, that not far from the Valley, several teenagers had their frankfurters stolen by something that boldly came into their camp and scared \"the living daylights\" out of them.  Their stories conflicted a little and they weren't sure of what they had seen, only that it was large, hairy and shaped like a man.  They, like so many, added \"But it definitely wasn't a bear.\"   \tThe Overlade print convinced me in a different way.  It looks like the animal slipped and crushed the humus-type layer into the ground.  The depth of it was uneven, like a slip, for it was on a grade near a large bush, indicating stealth.  The Overlade Print definitely was not made by someone out on a lark, for the anxiety surrounding the print, the slipping of it on the soft, twiggy ground and the ragged definition of it indicates that bigfoot is in the Valley, but as elusive as ever.",

But witnesses said the 12-foot-tall, upright, black \"thing\" ran past them so fast they weren't sure what it was. Construction workers who were napping in a van called police, who dispatched an off-duty officer working security at the mall site to investigate. The workers, who had fled to a nearby fast-food restaurant for safety, were reluctant to return to the construction site with the officer, said Sgt. Joseph Jordan. But the workers finally agreed to show the officer where they had seen the creature. ",
