            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length about his encounter. He stated that initially he thought it might be a turkey hunter crossing the road as he approached. He first saw it from a distance of about 100 yards, and said he came within 100 feet before it disappeared over the guardrail and into a ravine. He drove a short distance and turned around hoping to get another look at the creature, but it was gone into the woods. He said that he was most intrigued by the face, as the creature \"looked right at me\". The face was black, with the nose appearing to be flat, \"like a professional boxer\". The mouth was closed so he didn't see any teeth. His best description of the hair color was the color of aged moss. I took this to mean a grayish tint, which is possible. He said the creatures hair also had a mingling of red as well, and would have easily blended in with the forest, like camo. The witness grew up in the area and has had other possible activity through the years in the hills and hollers surrounding Shelbiana. Incidents of rock throwing and finding tree breaks were common when he was camping or fishing. After much research on the internet, he began to associate these behaviors with possible sasquatch activity. He also stated that there are many folk tales from the area, but that most people are reluctant to talk about such things. I am convinced of his sincerity about the event. Only after being prodded by his sons, did he post his report, having kept it to himself for many years. He is like many of the people I have spoken to, in that he is now glad to have had someone to tell it to, that was willing to listen and believe his story. I encouraged him to continue researching in his area. ",
