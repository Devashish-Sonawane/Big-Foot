They were very sure that the animals they saw were not bears, cougars, or any large antlered type animals.  The daughter was approximately 50' from the animals and the father estimated he got as close as 30' to the larger animal when he opened the gate to the acreage.  He reported the animal was standing next to a small grove of apple, pear and nut trees which were abundant with fruit. He said the animal looked like a gorilla or orangutan. The animal left at a fast pace, not on the run, and the man and his wife tried to run after it but lost visual contact with it in the pasture when the man stopped to let his wife catch up.  The animal did turn and look back at the man as it vacated area.  The man indicated that the animal was at least twice as wide as himself through the torso area.  He said he was not frightened at first but felt a sense of awe at being able to see this fine creature.  The daughter made a sketch of the animals she saw.",
