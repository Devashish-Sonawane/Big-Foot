The growls occurred down the trail near a swampy area.  The area is not easily accessible.  The growls were heard down an animal path about one hundred feet from the trail.  A crab apple tree was nearby.  The witness parked her car near the start of the trail and as they were sighting there they heard the whoop, and also encountered the heavy breathing.  While this was going on they both entered the vehicle with the windows down.  They noted what they thought were footsteps heading away from them to the northwest.  The wood knocks occurred in another swampy area that has one residence on the far side set into the forest.  The area is primarily marsh and a habitat to many animals.  Orchards, farms are nearby.

            "Follow-Up Report": "I  spoke with the witness by phone and he was careful and methodical in his description of the animal he saw.He was driving south on GA75 on a clear evening. It was approx. 6:15 pm and still 2 hours from dusk, when he noticed what he thought was a person in costume standing along the left shoulder preparing to cross. As he approached, he noticed it was not, instead it was an erect creature, 6'2\" to 6'4\". It was covered in light to medium brown hair. As he neared the creature, it turned toward him and looked right at him, then continued to turn and walk towards the woods. He later thought this odd, as he would expect an animal to turn way from him. The witness stated he sensed an intelligence behind its brown eyes. At the closest, he was 35' away, but his windows were rolled up, so he never noticed any odor. He further described it as having a slightly caved chest, with arms slightly longer than a man of the same height. It seemed healthy, but not particularly muscular in nature. He also described the skin under the hair as the same color as the hair, light to medium brown.   He could not describe the way the creature walked as he began searching for his phone at this point, hoping to get a picture. When he looked back, he was already out of view. He was prevented from pulling over and stopping by hay bales and plastic along his side of the road shoulder, used for erosion control. Working with the witness, a combination of the head #50 and body #13 sketches from Peter Travers' Painted Cave website, most resemble what he saw:",
