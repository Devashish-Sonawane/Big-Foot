            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness. The witness retold his story that he was hunting on an adjacent farm in a ground blind.  Early that morning, after settling in, he hears something step over the barbed wire fence.  He thought it was odd, because it would be impossible for a regular sized person to step over that fence.  Heavy footsteps came over to his ground blind and then he saw the impression of a nose on top of his six foot tall ground blind!  Alarmed, the witness heard distinct snuffling noises as if he was being checked out by an animal for smell.  The man called out a warning, whereupon the animal stopped sniffing. Once he stopped talking, the sniffing began again, only more aggressively.  As he tried to remain calm in his nylon shelter, he heard it walk around him once and walk back into the woods. That completed the hunting for the day.  We have a bipedal creature stepping over a five foot barbed wire fence and bending down to put their nose into the top of a six foot blind.  The witness also submitted Report #36229 ",
