Ruckel Creek, where the sighting occurred,  is among the steepest and most rugged drainages in the Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area. The trail Fred was hiking is particularly nasty. Ruckel Creek is also proximitous to sightings that have taken place on the I-84 freeway that parallels the Columbia River in the vicinity of Bonneville Dam.The photograph that Fred took of the creature does not provide any real detail; the distance to the creature is too great and the concealment in surrounding foliage is too great.  Still, Fred is to be commended for the preparedness and determination necessary to even attempt a photograph under the circumstances.  The combination of excitement and fear is impossible to comprehend by those who have not personally experienced a sighting at close range.  Fred will be even more prepared if there is a 'next time' and his calm, careful reactions in a clutch situation are a definite example for the rest of us.",
