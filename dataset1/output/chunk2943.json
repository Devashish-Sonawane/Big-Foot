He knew all the local fauna and could recognize their calls. The sounds he and his uncle heard, which seemed to be coming from two different individuals, do not match anything in his experience. Although the witness reiterated his general position as a \"non-believer of bigfoot,\" he remains troubled by what could have made these calls. He emphasized how he remembered the sensation of having the hair stand up on the back of his neck and the awful smell that drifted into their camp several minutes after the calls. He said he will listen to the bigfoot recordings on our BFRO website and see if any of these seem to match what he heard. ",
