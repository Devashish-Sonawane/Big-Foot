            "Follow-Up Report": "The gentleman filed a report unsure of what he and his friend had seen. The details are as follows:While playing golf on May 9, 2012 the two men pulled up to the 17th Green in their golf cart. They had played around several players and when they rolled up to 17, there was no other persons in sight. It is possible they were the first ones to get to 17 that day. Before getting out of the cart they both saw what appeared to be a 6 ft. tawny colored animal jump from a large tree. The tree was about 40 feet from them and the creature jumped out of the tree about 25 feet. The men were clear that it did not fall out of the tree, or climb down and jump; it clearly jumped out from a big branch.  Although the movement was fast they noticed the creature was large, tan colored and did not have a tail. Once it cleared the tree, it landed low in the undergrowth with a \u0093tremendous thud\u0094 that they heard and felt (The tree is not on the green.) They heard it take a few steps then stop.  They were concerned about the size of it as the tree rocked back and forth from the weight of the animal. They both cautiously and quickly played through while they took turns holding their clubs like baseball bats. Both thought at first because of the color, it could have been a mountain lion which are in the area. However, they both realized it was too large and heavy; it didn\u0092t have a tail, and didn\u0092t show typical mountain lion behavior. Generally, when a mountain lion is treed, it climbs down the trunk a few feet before it jumps DOWN.  Also, a bear would climb down, or perhaps fall, but not jump OUT.  Both of these animals would also run away once they landed on the ground. The creature that jumped out of the tree did not run, but hunkered down and hid.  The men know it could possibly be these animals, however, they believe it could have been a juvenile Sasquatch. I believe there is a big possibility it was too. Sasquatch colors vary just as much as human hair varies.   Colors of and varying shades of black, brown, red, white, gray and tan have been reported.  The golf course, Orchard Golf and Country Club, was built on and around an orchard. The course is also surrounded by heavily wooded hills and valleys. Fruit and nut trees are abundant which make this course popular with all types of animals. On this and most golf courses, there is limited but repeated human behavior that can be expected during certain times of the day.  There is no one on the course at night. Plentiful food, water sources, and methodical human behaviors create a great habitat for a Sasquatch. ",
