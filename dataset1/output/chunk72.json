            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Jill Bangart. Great witness.  She is very credible and very certain about what she saw on Friday morning before dawn. The sasquatch was only ten feet from the car when it disappeared from view in the trees on the edge of the road. Right before that the sasquatch was fully in her headlights as it sauntered off the road as she drove by.It was very tall. She couldn't give a height estimate but says it was much taller than the average person, and very muscular. The fur was \"dark and smooth\". It was not running across the road but rather walking. She believes she surprised it has she came around the curve. Jill commutes this route every week day around 5:30am on her way to the Navy Ship Yard where she works as a restoration contractor. There's a long history of sightings in this general area. Her commute at this hour would give her much higher odds for having a road crossing sighting than most folks in the area. Typically there a no vehicles, or very few, along this road at this hour. Why would a sasquatch be lurking around these woods a few miles from population? Answer: There are many deer in this area. It is a true deer hazard zone for motorists. She sees groups of deer near this road at least twice per week on her way to work. Both her and her son have had collisions with deer. It is a common occurance in this area.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I was able to communicate with Xxxx through a series of email correspondences. Xxxx is 50 years old and works in education in a local school district. He is an avid bird watcher who greatly enjoys the outdoors and spends much of his free time practicing his hobby.  After a series of email messages we decided upon a time to meet and visit the area where he had seen the footprints in the snow. The area is located in Southwest Maine in a local conservation area that has taken old potato fields and returned them to a natural state. I was impressed with the acres and acres of wild flowers and milk weed with aspen and other young trees repopulating the landscape. I have never seen so many monarch butterflies in one place at a time.Once past the fields we entered a forest of mixed hardwood and softwood trees. This is where Xxxx had seen the trackway in the snow in February. As we walked the trail through the woods it was evident that there was an abundance of wildlife in the area. We saw deer tracks, fresh bear scat (3 different places), beaver activity at a stream crossing and grouse feathers from a recent kill by a predator of some type. When asked about the footprints he saw and why he felt they were Bigfoot prints he mentioned they resembled prints he had seen online, in books and on tv. Although he did not have anything to measure them with he estimated them to be 1 \u00bd times larger than his size 9 \u00bd foot. Due to their size he speculates that it would be a juvenile. We also noticed a number of odd tree manipulations that did not seem natural including the top of a small tree that had been woven into a circular, lasso type pattern that was approximately 7 feet off the ground. Just something that makes you go hmmm\u0085. when you see it. Xxxx was also excited to say that just before I had come up to visit he had heard a wood knock coming from an area by the river behind his house a few days earlier late at night. I recommended that he get a recording device and run it all night to see if he could capture any other unusual sounds.When asked if he had ever experienced anything else Bigfoot related or out of the ordinary Xxxx told me stories of his childhood growing up in rural Allegany County in NY State. He told me of his first encounter while berry picking with his mother at 8 years old when they were startled by a Bigfoot that had jumped from a tree. In his early teens he would go camping with friends in the woods and they would hear them walking near their campsites once in their tents. He said initially this made him very nervous but the more it happened the more it became second nature. He and his friends would hear them communicating throughout the night with a series of soft whistles. He felt where they camped was a pathway where the Bigfoot passed through and the Bigfoot weren\u0092t necessarily all that interested in them. In his late teen years while in a gravel pit he was surprised by a loud demonic type scream that really scared him. He could feel this call reverberate in his chest. He heard the sound of falling gravel as if something was coming down one of the gravel pit bankings. He said he was too scared to look and just ran to his car and drove away as fast as he could. In hindsight he wishes he was a little braver and had tried to get a look at it. He felt that whatever it was did not want him around.Xxxx mentioned that in the county he lived in growing up Bigfoot was an accepted part of daily life. Many people encountered them, did not think much of it and rarely spoke of it outside of the community.After spending four hours hiking and talking with Xxxx I found him to be very sincere, upfront and honest. He shared his photographs with me and I find him to be quite credible. He wishes the area location stay private as he wants no harm to come to the creatures. ",
