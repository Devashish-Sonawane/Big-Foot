            "Follow-Up Report": "I reviewed the incident with the witness. He and his family are very experienced with the outdoors, having lived in Idaho and Alaska. Both he and his son have hunted grizzly and black bears, and are very familiar with the sounds that large animals can make in a variety of situations. On the day in question the witness and his son were hauling canoes and camping supplies back out from their spot when the witness heard a very loud bellow nearby. He's an experienced outdoorsman, and he described the bellow similar to the sound a grizzly bear made when it was shot by his son, but much louder. He then heard what he described as a deep throat mumble which sounded like muffled talking. He couldn't make out the words but to him it sounded like talking in a foreign language.The sounds were close by and loud. The witness met up with his son, who clearly heard the sounds, and told him to go to the canoes and watch upstream to an area he called \"the point.\" The witness went back to camp, got his shotgun, then began to make his way towards the point. As he crept his way through the cedar swamp towards the point, he heard very loud, strong thuds as if something was walking very close by on his right, paralleling his moves. As he got close to the point he moved towards his right to cut off whatever was following him. There was a moment or two when his view was obscured by the low hanging cedar branches. He no longer heard the thuds, or any other sounds. The woods were dead quiet. When he was able to see the point, the rocks which can be used to cross the river were dry, and he never heard any splashing which would have been made by an animal trying to cross the river. He also had cut off any point of retreat, too.  It appeared that the only course the animal could have taken was to have crossed the river on the rocks and quietly moved back into the thick underbrush on the other bank.On multiple occasions since the first encounter they have heard howls, whoops, and snorts, none of which in the witness' experience were made by deer or other animals. On one occasion his wife woke up in the middle of the night to adjust her Army cot, and heard a very loud tree knock very close by which was followed by a nearby response knock. All in all the witness and his family, who have years of significant outdoors experiences, are very credible witnesses.",

            "Observed": "myself along with my two best friends went down to see some family in tennessee during the summer for a few days. while down there we usually take some time to do some small game hunting. on our second to last day there we went back for about a mile or two to try and find the property line since the man who owned the land was in poor health and couldnt do it himself. he hadnt been able to go back that far since about 15 years do to his condition. we noticed the deeper we went into the woods we saw no animals and that was interesting to us. later that night we were at a small pond with a bonfire when one of my friends decided he needed to go back to the house. we had heard something pacing back and forth on a hill behind us, but we figured it was probably just a coyote or fox so we didnt pay it too much attention. he had a remington 870 shotgun with 6 shells of buck shot loaded anyways for the half mile walk back to the house by himself, on the front of which he had mounted a flashlight. about two minuites after he left we heard him fire all six shots in rapid succession. once we got to him he was scared stiff. all he could say was that something was staring down at him and show us how far apart its eyes were. we didnt stick around long thinking that he may have just injured a bear so we ran back to the house. once we got there he told us that he turned a corner to see the eyes staring down at him just off the path.. he yeld at the animal twice and it didnt move, so he shot. the animal was about 10 feet away and still managed to run off. well he went to sleep in the house and his brother and i went to go bed down outside in the barn loft. i had just laid down in my sleeping bag when i heard the most terrifying scream i have ever heard to this day. this animal screamed for a solid 20 to 30 seconds on one breath. i could tell that it was coming from the area we had just been however it was so loud even still i get chills thinking about it. it only let out one scream and then stopped. but as soon as it did, the entire forest fell silent. the only sound heard was the horse that had been spooked running around its stable. i didnt get much sleep that night. the next morning we had to leave so we didnt have much time to investigate the spot in the daylight. however we did confirm the spot where he saw the animal with a steep incline about 15 feet off the trail. i found no shot impacts from the shotgun even searching the ground leading us all to believe that the animal had been shot. since it had rained the night before the ground was still wet and i couldnt find but maybe one spot of blood. we tried to track it but we didnt have time and the woods were so thick that it was difficult to find any prints. there was only one deep indent which may have been a print but we couldnt tell. all i know is that the animal was big and still ran off after being hit 6 times with buckshot from 10 feet away and still had enough air in its lungs to scream as loud as it did for that long. i know a lot about animals and the only thing that i know of that could be that big would be a bear, but even a healthy uninjured bear doesnt make the sound this animal did. so i dont know what it was for sure but the only thing that makes since is bigfoot.",
