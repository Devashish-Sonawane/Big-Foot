The hair color was a uniform dark brown all over the body and a bit lighter on the shoulders and thighs. The witness had the strong impression that this was a male.

The other item he mentioned is that there is a cave about a mile from his friend's house that they have been curious about, yet they have only gone in a very short distance. This location is just a 30-40 minute drive from my home, and I have been in that area many times on business. I will be visiting him and his friend, at their invitation, after the first of the year. He seems sincere, precise, and has asked me to come out anytime. He is familiar with all wildlife, and knows the difference between 2 and 4 legged gaits. I have no reason to doubt his account(s). He also made note that as he was being paralleled, the woods were absolutely silent.....no sounds of any other wildlife were present.The Crooked River Conservation Area is just north of the location.",
