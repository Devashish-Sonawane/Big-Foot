Go past Fishtail about a mile and turn left (east) onto West Rosebud Road. Four miles farther, turn right (west) at the sign to Mystic Lake. Just 2.6 miles farther down the road, turn left (south) when the road Ys and take the gravel road across the West Rosebud River. The road parallels the river south before crossing it again. From this bridge, go 2 miles and across a cattle guard. Park just on the other side of the cattle guard. This is near the BLM corner.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Initially spoke to witness on 8/17/2016. She relayed story in some detail. She seemed sincere and no reason to believe story was anything but sincere.I've been in email contact with witness periodically since initial contact. She reports periodic strange smells in her neighborhood which is nearby the initial reported area. Reported contact area is extremely rugged in close proximity to Yellowstone Park. Have not an opportunity to do a field investigation yet.______________________________________________[Matt Moneymaker's note:This is classic sasquatch behavior: lurking unseen but steadily communicating their presence in various ways. The unspoken message grows clearer and clearer: \"This area is occupied.\" They do it more openly but still as gently as possible when they do not see potentially threatening intent, like when the see a female with a fishing pole rather than a male with a rifle.They do it as gently as possible compared to what they could do, mentally and/or physically, and with less effort, to achieve the same effect, like lazier bears would try to do for the same purpose.In this case like so many others the Sasquatches eventually achieved what they wanted to achieve:  The humans left the area and collectively agree that \"something is up there\" so they should avoid the area in the future. This has been happening for thousands of years in wilderness forests across North America. Most witnesses did not know what powerful yet civil creatures were intimidating them to leave from just beyond their field of view into the tall brush.These intimidation situations are some of the few precious opportunities for some type of interaction with these creatures so they should never be rebuked or deterred by humans. Always back down and leave when Sasquatches are going to the trouble to be so civilized about it.  We have many more options and they only occupy places like this area seasonally, at best.",
