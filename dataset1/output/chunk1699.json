            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness at length about his experience.  The area he was in is described as being a very swampy, remote area - about 3 sq. miles, some private land.  While out hunting, he initially heard some large animal noises over his shoulder in the area of a dry creekbed,  and waited to see what would occur.   Soon after, it got dark and he decided to pack up and was making a lot of noise when he heard a large crashing noise and heavy footsteps start running through the forest - 'like a large hunter with a lot of gear running through the woods', or 'an extremely heavy animal'.  He couldn't see anything in the direction of the sound because of the darkness and the thickness of the woods.  Other things noticed:Years ago large footprints which were spaced very far apart were found in the snow in this area.  This occurred on two separate occasions.   Near a stream in the area he has heard woodknocking, which was described as a hard, small stick hitting a small tree.  Horrible, very intense odors have been smelled in the area. 2-9-08 - The witness has added the following via email:You can add the following to my report; I believe most of it also took place during the 1990's.  I have this additional information because I have thought about my experiences a lot and researched Sasquatch facts since I submitted my report.I find it interesting that the other report from Manistee County , Report # 808, also involved hunters hearing something large crashing through the woods that got closer.  And I don\u0092t find this type of behavior is very common in the many other BFRO reports I have read.  I am realizing how heavy the animal that did the \u0093bluff charge\u0094 must have been.  The impression I got is that it weighed over 500 pounds and I think I remember it feeling like it was shaking the ground.  Afterwards, I did not get the impression that it was trying to intimidate me by getting closer or \u0093bluff charging\u0094, I simply felt like it was going a certain direction which happened to bring it slightly closer to me on the way.The wood knocks lasted for at least a half an hour.  It was an extremely calm day so I could hear them very clearly.  They seemed to have a pattern with intelligence behind them, they would stop and start and were various in number.  They did not change in tone or volume.  They were coming from the area of an 8 foot wide stream which was about 80 yards from my blind.The footprints in the snow looked as if they were made effortlessly and I don\u0092t see how they could have been made by a man.  I have only seen one other man back in there in all my years of hunting (unless that figure was a Sasquatch! - I remember waving at it and not receiving a return wave!)  The prints were large, boot sized or bigger and they were spaced at least a few feet apart.  Walking in the swamp by a man produces footprints that are spaced a foot apart or less because of the difficulty in walking on uneven mucky ground with fallen dead trees.  I am certain that no man was back in there from our deer camp.Regarding the horrible odors, I think they smelled like a wet dog that had rolled in feces.A large tree (probably an 8\" diameter or greater dead tree) fell over on a very calm day one year.  It fell after a very loud crack that echoed through the silent woods.All deer always seem to be extremely cautious when seen.  Deer (both bucks and does) have been seen many times running through the woods panicked for no apparent reason, since no hunters are nearby.I briefly saw what looked like something large, the color black, far away in the brush.  I could only see bits of it through the trees, there were two, close together and they were both higher up than a bear would be. ",
