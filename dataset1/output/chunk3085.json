            "Observed": "I was home alone one mid-October evening.  My husband and I have a cabin located in rural Lee County, KY.  It\u0092s a primitive cabin, no electricity, no phone, hand pumped water, no neighbors, etc.  My husband was visiting friends about 8 miles away.  Just after dark, I was sitting inside, reading a book, when I heard what sounded like two logs being hit against one another...making a loud, hollow \u0093knocking\u0094 noise.  The \u0093knocking\u0094 happened 3 or 4 times in a row...then it paused...\u0094knocked\u0094 again 3 or 4 times in a row...and this was repeated for about 15-20 minutes.   I looked outside but didn\u0092t see a thing.  You can\u0092t hardly see your hand in front of your face at our cabin, unless the moon is out...and it wasn\u0092t.  Just a few minutes after the \u0093knocking\u0094 stopped, someone or something threw what sounded like a handful of gravel onto the tin roof of the cabin.  We have oak trees around our property but the branches were mostly bare at that time and they don\u0092t hang over the roof...so nothing could have fallen from them onto the roof.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness about the incident.  A self-described \"city girl\", she had only lived at the remote cabin for a few months since marrying her husband. A few months pregnant, she had stayed home alone while he visited with friends. The cabin is located at the end of a dead end road, and the witness had not heard or seen any vehicles. Also, the terrain in the area would basically limit the cabin to one way in and one way out.  These events took place mid-week, when most of the dwellings in the area, (cabins, campers, tents) are not used. The witness and her husband have sold the cabin and moved away due to the incident.  I traveled to Lee County in January 2010 to follow up on a report of events that took place the same week as this report, about 10 miles to the south. The harrassment that took place there, was very similar to what this lady experienced. While in Lee County with Tennessee Investigator Rolf Gehman, we heard knocks and different vocalizations we attributed to possible sasquatch activity. I continue to recieve reports and local stories of other encounters in and around Lee County. ",
