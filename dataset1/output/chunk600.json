            "Observed": "I was out looking for deer with my mother and sister, We would drive the back roads and check certain fields and roadways and keep count of the deer.At the time the area was still mostly wilderness. My mother was driving this night and I was riding in the back seat, it was a warm night, we were riding with the windows down. As we pulled up to an intersection, we had to stop at a stop sign while we were stopped I looked over to the right and noticed a big brown animal about 10 yards away it looked to be about 3 1/2 to 4 feet tall. I could not identify the animal, I knew it was not a bear. While I was looking at it I was surprised when it stood up. I would estimate that it was over 8 feet tall, I rolled my window up right away because the animal was just standing there looking at us.As we contiued down the road my mother asked what I thought the animal was. I said what animal, at the time I was unaware that they had also seen it.My mother said the animal that caused me to roll up my window.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with this witness by phone and additional information can be added. He was 17 years old at the time, his sister was a couple years younger. All three were surprised/ shocked to see this creature.They were traveling west and stopped at a stop sign, the creature was on the right or north side of the road. Duration of sighting was minimum of one minute. Creature had long, shaggy, matted brown hair. The hair was different from any other animal but definitely not human looking. Muscular build with approximate shoulder width of 36 inches or more. No facial features were observed, but he sensed it was looking at him, which prompted him to roll up his window. The creature was at first squatting by what appeared to be an ant hill mound and stood up after the car stopped and idled there. ",

            "Observed": "On December 3 , 2011 we were heading east on hwy 96. We live in Happy Camp Calif. We left around 6pm we were going to Redding Ca. to pick up my son from the Grey Hound Bus station We passed a few cars coming the oppiset direction so every so often I had to dim my head lights. We were about one and a half hours in to the drive. I had to dim my head light's again and as we just passed,8 mile bridge I figured that I should hit the brights lights as we went around a vary slight curve (thats when) I hit the brights at that same moment a large rock (bolder ) stood up (straight up). It looked at us (me) It was a light grey color and had long shaggy hair. It had big eyes that looked yellow ( from the head lights would reflect off an animal?) I drive a 2001 Jeep Cherokee it was a lot bigger (taller) than my Jeep 4x4. It stood vary still except for its head it fallowed the car. When it stood up my mind went blank and I took my foot off the excelorator, we had a vary good long look at him maybe about 15-20 seconds it felt like forever.  The Jeeps head lights were on him the whole time! He seemed vary startled like we spooked him. To me he looked like he was trying to blend in with the surrounding mountain side I wrote a letter and a map I tried to paste it on this form. I had 4 of my children with me and 3 of them had seen him the 4th was asleep this time of year their are lots of rocks all over the hwy we were almost to the I-5 on ramp. When I came back to my senses I screamed so did everyone else and hit the gas and got out of their quickly we drove to the rest area and I had to get out of the car to breathe and stop shaking we all had to calm down. Now any time we have to go to town my son asks me if we are going to Yreka way if so he gets vary afraid. I know what we had seen that night .His body shape was that of a runner vary tall and slim and muscular not fat lean strong. I will take a lie detector test....I do not know what else to say I'm probally forgetting something.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness and her daughter (who was also a witness) by phone.  They recounted the sighting in a very straightforward manner and seemed to be more affected by the trauma of actually seeing the creature. There are a few additional details to add. -  The witness was focused on the large, yellow eyes. The face followed her as she drove slowly by the upright figure. -  The daughter noticed that the subject had long arms. -  Their car passed within 10 feet of this creature as it stood straight up and watched them pass. As I mentioned, the family was very frightened by the incident. There is certainly a lingering sense of trauma from merely seeing this creature so close to them. It did not threaten them or make a sound. We know that on that December evening, one was caught out in the open along Hwy 96. Multiple witnesses had a clear view at close range.",
