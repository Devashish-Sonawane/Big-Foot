Agawam Police have called off their \"Bigfoot\" team for the time being, but dozens of interested residents are continuing to visit the site of the huge tracks near Robinson State Park.  Marianna Cascio of Agawam, who asked Frank to conduct an investigation at the site, said she believes the tracks are authentic and belong to a 1,500-pound giant.  But no fresh tracks have been spotted since the first prints were discovered Monday evening, and she said the creature may have left the area.  Police, who say this is their first investigation into reports of a monster on the loose, still maintain they have no idea whether the five-toed tracks are that of a legendary ape- like mammal or the work of a prankster.

            "Observed.1  ": "The debate over whether Sasquatches really exist will continue until someone takes one in hand and leads it to the local primate center for a physical. But among those who have said they've seen a Sasquatch, there is a uniform belief that the hairy monster doesn't shower very often. There is a horrendous odor about Sasquatches, one that lingers long after they leave the scene, they say. What's that got to do with loggers? Well, Earl Thomas, 18, one of three Tacoma youths who said they saw an 8-to-10-foot Sasquatch in the dark near Rimrock Lake in Yakima County October 1, has come up with the most specific description of the odor yet. In an interview related in the Seattle based publication, Phenomena Research Report, Thomas said: \"It smelled like rotten logger's sox.\"",
