They cooked meat for dinner but there was no wind to blow food odors. The forest was silent. The daughter did a howl lasting about three seconds. Five to ten seconds later, a super loud wood knock came from about 400 yards above them. The witness said it was not a tree falling. The adults froze. Her skin \"crawled.\" Her son in her lap began shaking. Her daughter had a frightened look. Her son also cried when they went to their tents. They did not hear any other sounds nor detect any foul odor. They did not find any tracks although the children did look in the daytime. Due to the reaction of all people present, I find the witness credible. ",

            "Observed": "I was on a houseboat vacation with my family at Shasta Lake when I was 13.  We had put our houseboat to shore in a secluded cove that branched off of the main lake.  I went on a walk alone along the shore, and then followed a near-dry creek bed that came down out of the nearby woods to the lake.  I had followed the creek bed for about a mile when I came upon two sets of footprints in the mud along the creek bed.  Both looked human-like, with five-toes.  One set was about a size 14, the other about a size 9, comparing them to my own foot at the time.  They were very wide prints, and appeared neary flat-footed.  I was curious, though I hadn't made the Bigfoot connection yet.  It had seemed odd to me that someone would have been barefoot this far into the woods.  The tracks came out of the nearby woods, down to the creek bed, and they then followed the bed for a while away from the lake and into the deeper wooded region.  After a few hundred yards, they turned up a slight grade and into the woods on the opposite side from which they started.  Another thing that made me suspicious of the prints were that they had crossed the rocky creek bed, which was filled with sharp, shale-like stones.  It seemed to me that it would have been a very painful experience for any human to walk those rocks barefoot.  I noted that the larger prints were set wider apart than the smaller prints.  Still not making a BF connection, I went back to the houseboat and said nothing to my family.",
