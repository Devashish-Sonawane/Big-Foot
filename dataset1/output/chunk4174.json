            "Observed.1  ": "\u0093We\u0092ve been pretty busy,\u0094 commented security guard Charlie Straub  as he was hustled off for an interview with a television crew. Straub, an employee of Bob Reiman, was one of eight people who claimed to have seen the monster on June 3rd at Reiman\u0092s salvage year on the north edge of Murphysboro. Friday afternoon, anchorman John Pertzborn and cameraman Glenn Buermann of KSDK-TV in St.Louis walked into the newspaper office and interviewed acting managing editor Tom Tiernan. The two had just been to the salvage yard and stopped by the office to get a copy of the American and take a shot of the artist\u0092s conception of the monster which was used on the front page of last Thursday\u0092s edition. \u0093People are really interested in this thing,\u0094 said Pertzborn, who pulled out a piece of Associated Press wire copy which gave the story state-wide billing. Hoax or fact, the monster is certainly getting the coverage. We asked Pertzborn if the 90 mile trip from St.Louis wasn\u0092t a long drive for a monster which might not exist. \u0093Oh, we didn\u0092t drive,\u0094 responded Pertzborn. \u0093We flew down in the helicopter.\u0094 Although police are not getting involved in the recent reported sighting, the monster is being investigated by at least one expert from Indiana who specializes in research on Bigfoot or Sasquatch type characters. As of late last week, the site had been visited by an estimated 200 people, many of them just curious, but some of them were serious monster buffs. The latest reported sighting brings to 29 the number of people who claim to have seen the hairy beast over a twelve-year span. There have been a total of 12 incidents in which persons have claimed to have seen the creature, most of them occurring in rural Murphsyboro.",
