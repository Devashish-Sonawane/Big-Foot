            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness. The encounter occurred between 3:30 and 4:00 am. Prior to this incident, there had been a few other interesting incidents. One was the incident where something had been digging in the ground. Another happened approximately 2 weeks prior to the one today. While the witness was in his shop one night, something came by and hit the side of the building very hard. By the time the witness could get outside, there was nothing there that he could see. He said that it was harder than something just running into the side of the building, he felt it was deliberate. The witness lives on a piece of land 50 acres in size. There are 4 trailers there, 2 of them occupied. Other than himself, his parents live there as well. There are 2 campers there also, one of them occupied. The portion of the land they live on is approximately 10 acres, with the rest of the property fenced off. The witness was woken up by the sounds of dogs barking. He went out to investigate and only saw 1 of his dogs. As he was walking back to his trailer, something ran past him, knocking him and his dog over. He shot three times as he was falling to the ground, once into the ground and the other two times in the direction of whatever had knocked him down. He got up, went to his shop to un-jam his gun (.22 rifle). After getting more ammo, he left his shop and was hit by an overpowering odor. He described it as a combination of animal feces and wet grass. He decided to climb up on top of his parent's carport to better survey the area. He noticed a large shadow next to a school bus that is on the property. He at first thought that it was the shadow of one of his dogs. While he was watching it, it turned to look towards him and he noticed that it was a dark figure. It was as tall as the door on the bus. He felt that it was looking directly at him. When it turned in his direction, the whole upper turned, as it it didn't have a neck. He then heard strange vocalizations coming from his right, the figure was to his left. He looked in the direction of the sounds. It sounded like \"a whole pack of dogs, but it stopped all together.\" When he turned back towards the bus, he didn't see the figure. He looked closer and noticed that it was no longer standing, it was squatting down on its haunches. It then got up, turned about face and ran off around the bus. He said that it moved very fast. The witness got down and went to where it had went around the bus. He did not see anything there. The barb wired fence was still moving as if something had crossed over it. The total time that he had a visual was no more than 25 seconds. He never heard any noise coming from the figure. Another investigator went to the scene. He talked to the witness at length about the encounter. He also searched for any evidence of an animal's presence. He did find some wild plum trees in the area that the creature ran off to. He measured the height of the bus and the door was 7 foot tall. The investigator's opinion was that the witness either saw one of these creatures, or a very tall man.

            "Observed": "One evening a friend and I were riding my ATV through the Sam Houston National Forest. While riding down a straight and rather wide trail approximately 20 yards wide, I turned around to say something to my friend who was riding as passenger. Whenever I turned back around there was a large humanoid creature, approximately 6 \u0096 6.5 foot tall, broad shouldered and thick in appearance, with either dark brown or black hair covering its entire body. It spooked me and I yelled at my passenger to look. When I yelled the creature turned and ran into the woods, (the creature made a quick turn upright and ran upright \u0096 this marks out the possibility of being a bear). My friend did not see it and asked what I was yelling about. I could not speak from awe. The creature was only approximately 40 \u0096 50 yards in front of us in the wide open. I sped up the ATV to the location where the creature ran into the woodline. The limbs and brush were shaking back and forth but I did not see him again due to the thick underbrush East Texas is known for. It scared me at first and I downshifted the ATV as fast as possible and sped away, stopping several hundred yards down the trail to explain to my friend what I had just seen. It was an experience I will never forget, and who knows maybe it was meant just for me to see. I have told many people this story, most laugh. But I know what I saw.",

He said when he first saw the creature, he thought, \"bigfoot.\" No facial details could be recalled due to the distance of the encounter. The sighting lasted perhaps three seconds before the \"broad-shouldered\" upright animal headed into the thick undergrowth of the Sam Houston National Forest. The witness has tried to tell others of what he saw, but he has mostly been met with derision.While investigating the general area, BFRO investigators heard a series of six, close range, loud, moaning howls almost identical to the BFRO's \"Ohio Howl.\" These howls were longer than the \"Ohio Howl\" and ended with a sort of growl. The last of the howls modulated up into a high-pitched howl. The howls were followed by the loud sound of a large branch snapping. Nothing else was heard after the first series of vocalizations. ",
