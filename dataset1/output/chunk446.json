            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness included this sketch of what she saw that day, and after referencing some maps, pinpointed the location of the sighting.I spoke with the witness by phone and she seemed credible and sincere. Her sighting happened on her way to Tampa on a clear spring day last year. It was a nice cool day by Florida standards, so she had her passenger side window cracked to let in fresh air. In an area near Little Manatee River State Park (she cant be sure as it was a long stretch of road), she noticed what she first thought was a man walking quickly just 30-50 ft from the shoulder heading N away from her. It was a few feet from the woodline. As she neared the figure, she also noticed it was covered in brown hair from head to toe. It was walking with long purposeful strides, head and knees slightly bent. The hair was 3 inches long and definitely brown. She continued to describe it as much more manlike, than apelike. It had a round head like a man, and the arm length was normal, not long and down to the knees. But it was definitely covered in hair, and as she came up next to it, it veered off towards the wood line, walked into the thickets, and disappeared. The witness never saw its face. She said the thickets looked too dense for a man to just walk into.  Even for this large animal.. She then noticed a very strong smell of rotten eggs/sulphur in the car, and had to roll the windows down for 10 mins before it finally dissipated. She never felt any fear as she was in a car and it never gave her a reason to fear it. ",
