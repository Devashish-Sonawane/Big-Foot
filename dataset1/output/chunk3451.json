My step father and I were hunting in Pendleton County and had split up on either side of a ridge. At around 6 am before daylight, I heard a loud \"whooping\" that was so loud it almost sounded as if it came from an amplifier. This only happened once, but my step father and I both heard it and agreed it wasn't a normal animal sound.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness, the following details can be added to his report:-It was difficult to see details of the creatures face because it was in the shadows. However, he could see that the hair on its head was either dark brown or black and the head was slightly pointed at the top. -He could only see the top of the shoulders, and they looked very large. -He believes whatever the creature was, it was intelligent, because when it saw him looking back at it, it quickly hid, where a bear or another animal would have run.-Looking back, the witness wishes he had stayed longer to see if it would  walk or run away, but he was very frightened after it growled at him.-When speaking with his step father later that night, he learned that two other people in their hunt club pulled into a food plot one night and saw something tall and black run into the woods on two legs. This happened not far away, near the town of Brandywine. -The witness listened to recordings from the BFRO website and reports the whoops from this 1974 recording from the Sierra Sounds collection sounded most similar to what he and his step father heard that morning.-There is a growing list of report within a few miles of this location, and it includes reports 17326, 28449, 34583, 30154, and 36662.-Before this event the witness did not believe in bigfoot, but now he is reconsidering his position and reading as much as he can.

Now, in the Lagunas around Julian, in San Diego County, I have been actively pursuing reports of Bigfoot in these mountains and the Anza-Borrego Desert below, and most particularly within a certain Indian Reservation. In February, 1981, I happened to be at the right place at the right time to meet a young Indian who talked openly of his interest in Bigfoot and said he had seen him on his reservation and knew the location of caves where Bigfoot hid, and he would take me there - now!",
