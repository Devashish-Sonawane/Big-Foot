            "Observed": "A friend and I were driving toward Canada on a secondary highway in Oregon.  It was dusk and we were travelling at about 55 to 60 mph. in a 1989 Ford Escort.  We went past something on the road.  It was hunched over eating something on the road, right in the middle of the road.  It's back came to the top of the car door. It appeared to be two colors, brown and gray and looked kind of like a really, really big wolverine or something. It was definitely NOT a bear.  It exhibited no fear of the car and as we went past it lifted its head and looked right at us.  When I looked in the rearview mirror it had resumed eating.  It was a massive animal, the like of which I have never seen before, or since.  My friend and I didn't speak for about half an hour, then we both simply said, \"Did you see that?  What the hell was it?\"  To this date, we still can't figure out what it was we saw.  I know it was not a bear and it was far too large to be a wolf or a dog.  I was raised on a farm and have seen fox, coyote, and bear numerous times.  This creature was huge and very solid looking.  I would estimate that, if erect, it would have stood at least 7' tall, perhaps more. The hair was, as I said, of two different colors, lighter around the head area and then darker over the rest of the body.  The hair appeared to be about 3 inches long.  The snout was strange, not like anything I've seen before, kind of dog-like, but more pushed-in.",
