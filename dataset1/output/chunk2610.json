He reiterated the details of the conversation he shared with the witnesses upon their return and their conclusion that they had possibly or probably witnessed a bigfoot. He then obtained permission from his father-in-law to personally discuss his observations with me also.The witness is a local college professor. He and his friend observed the figure at a distance he estimated to be almost a quarter-mile away and on a prominent ridge. He assumed it possible that the figure did not see them because it did not appear to be paying particular attention to their location which was in the pines and in shadows. At first, they thought it may have been a very large person in a heavy jacket but quickly decided that was unlikely given the very warm temperature of about seventy degrees for this late October mid-afternoon. It was uniformly black in coloration from head to toe and a glossy sheen reflection was occasionally visible.The figure was only on two legs the entire time they observed it as they watched for three to five minutes before it moved off and out of sight behind the ridge. Upon further consideration, the witness also thought it noteworthy that a nearby windmill provided a reliable source of water.David Petti",
