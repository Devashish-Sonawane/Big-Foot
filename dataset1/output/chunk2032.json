            "Observed": "It was January 1977, and Little Ruben Rios and Danny Mirales had talked Ruben Hernandez, my husband, into taking them snow camping. Ruben had the experience and the equipment, but was reluctant, because neither Rios nor Danny had much camping experience, and had never camped in the snow.  But winter camping prevailed, and they ended up on the boarder of Stanislaus National Forest and the west side of Yosemite National Park... a place that was called Carl's Inn, then later renamed Carlon. It is located on the South Fork of the Tuolumne River on Evergreen Road.  The road was open in winter possibly due to the fact that it's on the way to Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. It's not too far, on the map, from Highway 120 and Yosemite's Big Oak Flat Entrance Station.  It is about 4575 feet elevation. Camping is not allowed there anymore, but we still fish there in the spring and summer. Carlon is in a narrow valley, with ridges on both sides, and the road drops quite a bit between the highway and the stream.",

The area is now closed to camping, but is open to day-use.  It is a very popular recreation area since it is close to the entrance of Yosemite.",
