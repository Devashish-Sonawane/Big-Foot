            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and I have discussed this incident on the phone a few times and I found him to be very credible.  Thinking he was seeing the property owner or a person that didn't see or hear him, he moved to a position where he would see the person eventually come out of the woods.  When it came out of the trees into the clearing he was able to see that it was not a person.  He was close enough to know they were making eye contact but because of the overcast day and shadows, he was not able to see additional detail of the face.  He did not feel threatened and he did not get the sense that the creature was too concerned about him.  His friends were still in the pit. Still working for an organization that maps caves and their entrances, they have documented a total of 3,434 caves in the state of Indiana.  The difference between a pit and a cave is a pit is vertical and a cave is horizontal.The location was next to Clear Creek and only about five miles from Lake Monroe (actually an artificial reservoir). The lake is the largest in Indiana with 10,750 acres, including three recreational areas - Fairfax, Hardin Ridge and Paynetown. Indiana's only federally protected U.S. Wilderness Area, the 13,000 acre Charles C. Deam Wilderness Area, is located on the south shore.",
