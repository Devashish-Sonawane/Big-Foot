            "Observed": "While on vacation, my family and I were camping at Linville trailer lodge and campground in Linville North Carolina. On June 15th, 2010 we were all sleeping in our pop up camper. At 2:00 am I was woke up by the sound of an animal to the south east of our camper. Its calls were 4 short whoops followed by 1 double whoop. After listening to that for a couple of minutes I heard another one calling from the North West. Its call was 3 short whoops followed by a double whoop. While listening to that one, another from the North West started calling. Its calls were 2 short whoops followed by a double whoop. After a couple of minutes I could hear them calling and moving towards the north east. It sounded like they were with in 100 yards of our camper but I was the only one that got woke up. On June 17th we got ready for bed about 9:00 pm. around 9:30 pm I could hear the same calls as the second and third animals from 2 nights before, they were much further away this time. My 8 yr old daughter heard them also and asked what kind of animal makes that sound? I did not answer her. After we got home I got onto your web sight and played the whoops and knocks from the Sierra Nevada Mountains, my daughter came running from her bed room and said that is what I heard the other day. Then I explained to her what it was she heard.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to Tim today on the phone. He and his family actually live in Ohio, and were just vacationing in the mountains of NC, specifically at the Linville Falls Trailer Lodge & Campground. The interesting thing about these whooping sounds is how close one of the subjects was to Tim's campsite.  He said at least 100 to 200 yards, close enough that the whooping sounds actually woke him up. He also said, that at one point, he could actually hear them walking around near the campsite.He stated in the original report that his daughter heard the sounds a couple of nights later and even had asked \"what kind of animal makes that sound\", but, he actually heard her saying that to herself, and not directly to him.  He didn't want to scare her, so he didn't reply to her questioning.  When they got back home to Ohio, he was playing the sound clips from the Sierra Sounds and his daughter came running in saying \"That's what I heard the other night at the campground!\".Tim's story is credible, and I feel he was privileged to experience what he did here in the mountains of North Carolina.",

I walked along the fire road for about 100 yards and saw something moving down below me in the trees along the river, about thirty yards away.  Thought it might be an elk, it was big.  Now, not too sure.  It was shaking a few of the smaller trees.  Then it stopped and I think what ever it was, may have seen me.  It seemed to duck into the brush and disappear.  I continued on my walk and did not see anything the rest of the hike.  I did feel like I was being watched though.",

The night was clear and cool and there had not been any rain for about a week.  So it was pretty dry.  I breathed in through my nose to smell the fresh air and to my surprise the smell I got was of wet fur with a sickly sweet smell to it.  It was almost to the point of being nauseating.  I looked around for the source of the smell.  I could not find it.  It was about 8:00 P.M.  I went back inside the house and tried to think of what it could have been.",
