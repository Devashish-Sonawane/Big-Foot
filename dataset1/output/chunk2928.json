            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke Bryan H. at length.  He is a competent, professional wildlife suveyor. He comes from a well connected family in the Whitehall area, and currently works for an established environmental consulting firm near Albany, New York.Bryan is well qualified to rule out the obvious possibilities for the knocking sounds he heard. His conclusions mean something when it comes to natural sounds. Many wild species are surveyed and counted purely by their sounds.---------------------------------Bryan agrees with something first proposed by the BFRO years earlier. The intermittent, loud, roving, knocking sounds that are heard, occasionally, in some forests in North America, may be the best, distinctive, surveyable indicator for the presence of sasquatches in a habitat area. In other words, listening for knocking sounds in a possible habitat area may be the best way (or the only feasible way) to take a population count.-----------------------------------It is not known why sasquatches make these loud knocking sounds, or exactly how they make them, but these sounds have been described in many different areas where sightings and track finds also occur. Witnesses will sometimes hear a single, powerful knock sound, or a short, rapid series of knocks, coming from a given section of woods. The sound is often 'answered' a moment later by a similar knock coming from a different direction. The sounds are often close by, so it is easy to rule out echoes of distant man-made sounds.The knocks are described as similar to the sound of someone chopping wood, but they are not repetitive like someone chopping wood, and they do not remain stationary. ----------------------Loud knock sounds may help sasquatches coordinate their relative positions when moving through terrain. This is the same impression Bryan got as he stood and listened to them move away from him.----------------------Old timers in the Whitehall region tell stories of the local \"Mountain Devils\". The appearance and behavior of the Mountain Devils easily fits the description of sasquatches.There is a local book from the 1970's about the history of sightings and encounters in this area, particularly around Whitehall. The book title is  \"Monsters of the North Woods\". The author is Paul Bartholomew. This book has been out of print and hard to find for years. Copies might still be available through a small book dealer/publisher specializing in NY state related titles. Look for the book listing for \"Monsters of the North Woods\" on the web site  http://www.hopefarmbooks.com/ -------------------------------------The most famous incident in the Whitehall area occured in the 1970's. The incident involved four law enforcement officers (from more than one jurisdiction) who responded to a request for assistance by a Whitehall police officer. The four officers who came to his assistance witnessed the animal. One of the officers fired his gun at it as it fled. Casts of the tracks were made the following day. BFRO members have visited the Whitehall area before, primarily to make contact with the surviving witnesses of that shooting incident. In the course of that visit, two years ago, while hiking around in the surrounding mountains and hills at night, the BFRO members heard knocks and other vocalizations.------------------------------------The Whitehall, New York area has an impressive variety and density of wildlife, due largely to the amount of wetlands among the hilly terrain.  Wetlands in hilly terrain do a decent job of aborbing and retaining solar energy. The air temperature is buffered and stabilized by the heat absorbed into the bogs and swamps. The air at night is noticeably warmer than nearby areas with no wetlands. The growing season is longer in these micro-climates, which leads to a greater abundance of fruiting plants, foraging animals, and predators.The mountains around Whitehall have numerous rock outcroppings, overhangs and caves. These rocks also absorb heat during the day and radiate it at night.The position of the mountain where the knocks were heard has strategic advantages, with respect to both the acoustics of long range vocalizations (howls), and the travel path between other points in the area where other sightings have happened.------------------------The witness, Bryan H., is interested in helping with the 2005 New York State BFRO Expedition.
