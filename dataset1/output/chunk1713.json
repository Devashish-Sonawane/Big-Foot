I have been hunting now for 34 years and besides hunting 8 of the 11 western states I've also hunted the deep interior of Mexico and I have never heard anything like that before! It was the only time I have truly been frightened!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with Patrick M. tonight, and we discussed his sound encounter in the San Gabriel Wilderness Area of Los Angeles County in 1976.   Patrick has spent many hours calling for varmints and is very much aware of the different sounds that most animals make at night.  The screams that this animal made that night in 1976, just about scared him to death.  Because of this encounter, Patrick is in the process of seeking out an explanation for them, and he has spent a lot of time trying to learn as much as is possible about the sasquatch animal.I asked Patrick the following questions:1. How many times did the animal make the screaming sound?  Patrick said, \"that it made a similar screaming sound three different times as it moved along the ridge trying to get down wind of him.\"2. About how far away was the animal when it first made the screaming sound?  \"He said it was approximately 200 yards or closer, from his location on the ridge.\" 3. Did you ever smell anything strange?  \"No! Probably because there was a light wind blowing.\"4. Can you describe the scream?  \"They were hard to describe, but he will never forget them.  The screams sounded similar to the Ohio and the Sierra sound bites, that are on the net, but much louder and a lot more threatening.\"  He knows that the screams came from a very large animal. 5. Did your high power light ever light up its eyes?  If it happened he didn't see any reflection from any eyes. But, it may have blinded the creature, because when he turned the light on, that's when it made its first scream. 6. Did it ever make any other sounds when it moved down the ridge? Not that he could tell.",
