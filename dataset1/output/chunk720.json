            "Observed": "I was driving to work Friday, May 10. I twas approximately 6:15 EST. I had just cut off Hwy 278 at the Shilo Church road and had gone approximately 1 mile. It was light enough that I could see into fields, I was looking for deer which is my hobby while driving. The first field that I came to I began to scan it. There was something standing in the field about 30 yards from the road. It was around 8' tall. I could see the body and head, with the body extending down into the grass which is about 3' tall. By the time I stopped my truck, the figure was no longer there.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness on the afternoon of 18 June at the sighting location. The witness is a retired educator from Alabama who is now working in Georgia. He travels this route regularly and enjoys looking for wildlife in the fields as he passes. He is confident in what he saw. As he passed the field, he saw a large, man shaped figure standing above the grass which at the time was approximately 3 feet tall. He estimated the total height at 8 feet as estimated by a gate/entry in the fence (shown in the picture, the direction looking at the gate is almost due East). He traveled approximately 1/4 mile down the road (direction would have been to the south east) before he could stop and turn around. He immediately went back to the area where he saw the creature and it was gone. The distance to the back of the field at that point would be about 100 yards. He did not see any trail in the grass nor did he observe anything moving. He observed the area for another 8-10 minutes then continued on to work. He follows the same route currently and now watches diligently but has seen nothing other than deer and turkey.After visiting the location, I believe whatever it was probably dropped to the ground and was hidden in the deep grass until he left. I have no reason to believe the witness is not being completely truthful in what he has reported.This area of western Polk County is relatively unpopulated and is bisected by numerous creeks and areas of dense forest with pasture land intermingled. The area supports stable populations of deer, wild hog, turkey, and black bear. Within 3-5 miles are several ore mines that have been abandoned since the 1940's.",

            "Observed": "I am a security officer in Jacksonville, FL. I was on duty in an area know as Deerwood Park. Located in a quickly developing area that was once owned by Skinners Dairy. The area is still heavily wooded. Two weeks ago I was on duty in a building and went outside to smoke a cigarette. I was outside for 5 minutes. I heard a noise like something moving through the tree line. I turned my head toward the noise and the noise stopped. I called on of our vehicle patrols in the area and we moved to the tree line to investigate. We could hear the movement of something very large making very suttle movement. The officer with me and myself felt very uneasy. Laying on the ground 8-10 feet from the tree line was a branch from a pine tree. The needles on the branch were still green.There were no burn marks at the break to indicate lightning had struck. The branch was approximatly 3 inches in diameter and appears to have been broken and then ripped from the tree.What ever it was,sounded",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Assisted by Investigator: Dave SidottiOn Friday, Sept. 15, 2000 Investigators Stocking and Sidotti travelled to the area. The following are the events which occurred during Aug. 22, 2000 and Sept. 15, 2000. There are a total of 4 witnesses:S.G. ,M.C., M.L., and H.W.Aug. 22: S.G. heard movement in the woods while standing outside one building have a break. He radioed for another officer to join him. They both moved to the tree line to investigate. They heard the movement of something large moving throught he underbrush. This is when they found the tree limb on the ground. NOTE: I looked at all the trees near the limb and could not find evidence that the limb had come from any of these trees.Sept. 1: S.G. and M.G. were one break outside one of the buildings they patrol (2:30 am) when M.C. saw an individual approx. 8 feet tall walking at the tree line. The creature walked along the tree line, went between two buildings, and exited into adjoining woods. M.C. jumped in his car to pursue it, but lost sight after it went between the buildings.The creature, per witnesses description, looked like a tall, well proportioned human. It was walking on two legs, at a good stride, with a smooth, rhythmic walk. The arms were swinging.Sept. 6: M.L. was on patrol in his car (2 am) when he stopped a man driving his car in a restricted area known as Limerock Trail. While talking to the man informing him that he would have to leave (the man was apparently scouting for deer), both men heard a loud growl coming from the tall reeds next to the tree line. The reeds were approx. 50 ft. away from them.  M.L. described the sound as \"sounding like a growl a bear would make, but it definitely wasn't a bear\". The growl was very load, and sounded as if it was from \"a big set of lungs to project that sound\". The growl was sustained for approximately 30 seconds. The reeds where the sound came from are 7-8 feet tall. That morning (6 am) S.G. and M.C. went to this location to investigate. They did not hear  anything, but they found an area of small trees which looked to be pushed over.NOTE: I looked at the trees in question. Some had the appearance of being broken off 12-15 inches off the ground. These trees were anywhere from 3 to 6 inches in dia.Bark was scraped off in some places. There was no evidence of any heavy equipment in the area where the trees were found.Sept. 10: M.C. and H.W were patrolling the housing development under construction at 2:30 am. They were on a piece of private property behind the development walking down a dirt drive when they saw a pair of eyes approx. 6 feet off the ground. They both decided to advance towards them when another pair of eyes \"stepped out from the trees behind the first\". The distance from them to the eyes was roughly 75 feet. The eyes had an orange/red reflection.At this point both men decided to retreat from the area.NOTE: While there, I spoke with the caretaker of this property. It has horses on the property. I specifically asked if the horses are left out at night to graze, the caretaker informed me that the horses are always barned up at night. They would not have been out any night. This private property is 90 acres of woods with cypress, pines, and oak hammocks interspread throughout. There is a stream running through most of the property.Sept. 15: H.W. and M.C. were walking the Limerock Trail at approx. 6:30 am. They found a trackway of footprints walking up the trail and then turning around and returning back down the trail and then into the woods.NOTE: I viewed these tracks. They appeared to be several days old. Measurement of the tracks were 12\" x 4 1/2\"The tracks are inconclusive.",
