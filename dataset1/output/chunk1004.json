            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with the witness at length, he is a retired police officer with 16 years on the force.  He expressed how grateful he was to tell his story to someone who would believe him. He seemed to be very credible and articulate.Witness states this occurred Thanksgiving 2007. It was after dinner. His father-in-law, (FIL) and brother-in-law (BIL), both work for the county as county road operators. BIL manages a cattle ranch outside of Grapeland. On this day they drove about 4 miles outside of the town of Grapeland and took a county road going east. The land was located behind Vulcraft Steel Foundry. It was around 3:45 pm, sun was still up. The property was on the left side of the county road. FIL got out and opened gate, then returned to truck. As he closed the truck door, directly in front of the truck a large, hairy animal came out of a clearing about 10 yards out from the truck. The creature crossed about 30 yards in front of the truck. All three of the men were looking forward and saw the creature. The truck had not yet moved and they were all looking straight ahead. Witness states the creature crossed in about 3 strides, went over a fence and into a thicket. Witness states all of this happened in about five seconds. The creature never looked in their direction. Witness describes total silence, no birds, no branches breaking, just a creepy feeling that sucked the air out of them. They all agree that they had just seen a Bigfoot. Witness described the creature as 8 \u0096 9 feet tall. Witness said he is 5\u009211 and weighs 325 lbs. and comparing the creature to his own size, he estimates this creature had to weigh 850-900 lbs. due to the massive volume. He describes the chest like a 55 gallon drum. \u0093He looked like a refrigerator with arms.\u0094 Color was dark brown to black. Covered in hair all over.  Creature was bent at the waist, leaning forward as he ran. Arms were down around his knees. Creature never looked in their direction, but they all had the sense he knew they were there, but had seen an opportunity to cross and did so.Witness says they got out and looked for footprints, but saw nothing. FIL noted where creature came out of the thicket there was a large tree with a pine knot on it. FIL stated creatures head was at about that pine knot.  FIL measured that to be about 9\u0092 tall. BIL has about 27 hog traps set in an area close to the sighting.  One of the hog traps was recently demolished; the side was completely torn off of it. The three men went to the hog traps later that night and caught 24 pigs. Asked to speak to the FIL and BIL, one has since deceased and the other did not want to be interviewed for fear of losing his job. ",
