            "Observed": "While growing up, my grandparents would take my brother and I up to Lookingglass, Oregon for about 2 weeks to visit with my Uncle and cousins.  Over the years there are several incidents that stand out in my mind, but the one(s) that prompted me to write you occured during my stay in the summer of 1989.  Two of my cousins and I were up very late watching some movies.  When the movies were over, we decided to go outside and goof around.  As we were running out the door, a strange sound stopped us in our tracks.  It was coming from the creek bottom and made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.  It began to sound as if a cow was beying, a very deep gutteral sound advancing into a howl that lasted about 5-10 seconds.  At first I was dismissing it as one of the neighbors cows, but my cousin said she had never heard it before and the end of the vocalization sounded more like a wolf than a cow.  I yelled for my younger cousin to come back inside, she had frozen in place when the sound started, and we locked the door - something that they never do because the location is so rural.  I had never been so frightened by a noise in my life.  What ever it was sounded very large and I was in doubt that the locked door would stop it if it decided to investigate it's surroundings.  It sounded very close, but we were located in a valley, and because of the echo it was hard for me to figure out exactly how close it really was.  Two nights later I heard it again, this time I was alone on the dirt road that connects the \"highway\" to the properties on the Mountain.  I was walking to the bridge that covers a creek that seperates the properties when I heard it again, starting low and growing to a high-pitched howl.  I froze and waited, it sounded again a few minutes later, closer than before.  I listened to the vocalizations on the web site, and it sounded like the Ohio sound in its pitch and duration.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Lookingglass, Oregon, is located west of Roseburg in southern Oregon and should not be confused with the town of Looking Glass, located in the northeast corner of Oregon.The witness relayed that during another summer visit, she and her cousin made a run to the bridge near their home. On the return trip from bridge, about a quarter of a mile from home, her cousin stated she thought they were being followed. The girls heard something large walking in the same direction they were, but hidden about eight feet up into the treeline. The road was a narrow, two lane dirt road, surrounded on both sides by steep wooded hills. They noted that whatever was walking, would stop and start walking as they did. The cousin became very frightened, yelled \"Bear!\" and started running for home. The cousin reached home well ahead of witness and the witness heard her uncle calling for her. He was afraid she would run into the bear.  The witness made it home without further incident, but feels strongly that it was not a bear following them that day. She recalls the sound of bipedal walking and some crunching of vegetation with the footsteps.",

            "Observed": "Last night, Jan.16,2005, I took my dog outside for a little walk. We live on 2 acres in Redwood Valley, CA.  It was dark and about 6:00 with a mod. overcast sky, the moon peeking through the clouds. We have a small dog that will usually bark in response to any other dog barking in our area.  Houses are well-spaced on our rolling hillside that's covered with a mix of oak and pines. From Hwy. 101 looking west, you see very few houses on our hillside. Anyway, as I was walking I could hear this very unusual \"animal\" sound unlike any I've heard before. It was NOT a dog howling and I'm not even sure how to describe it. We have coyotes and mountain lions and the sound would not fit the description of their cries or calls either. It had a yelling/howl quality that lasted about 5 seconds , would break off and then resume about 15 seconds later. I went in the house to get my husband so that he could hear the sound. My dog was not barking which is really unusual because he's inclinded to bark at dogs or other unfamiliar sounds.  None of the dogs on our hillside were barking either which seemed odd to me. I was kind of scared .  My husband came out and listened. His initial response was, \"Anyway, it's on the other side of that hill.\" I said, \"It's not a dog, and our dog is not barking at it.\"  He agreed it was strange but wasn't concerned. Soon thereafter, a dog could be heard barking and our dog started in with his typical barking response. The unusual sound stopped and I didn't hear it again. This is not the first time we've heard  unusual sounds that we can't identify. We woke up one night hearing whooping sounds outside the house that I can't connect with any animal I'm familiar with. My daughter has also heard whooping sounds on the same hillside where we heard the unusual sounds last night. My teenage son heard whooping sounds last summer in the manzanita to the north of our house. We had an odd experience last summer. My college aged son and his friends were imitating \"Big Foot\" sounds that they'd heard on the internet . It was about 11:00 at night when they were fooling around , loudly imitating the sounds.  About 1:00 AM, that same night, we were watching a video and we heard a scratching at the window. We all thought my son was outside trying to scare everyone. All of a sudden , water was splashing all over the side of the house. A water sprinkler pipe outside the window had been snapped off, and water was geysering out of the pipe. My son walked out of the bathroom and it turned out he'd been in the house all along. No one had been outside and we still wonder how the pipe was snapped off. Whatever had been scratching at the window had apparently broken the pipe.  We all wondered if it was a response to the Big Foot calls that the guys had been making. Anyway, here's a synopsis of a few incidents. We decided to post these after last nights occurrence of the strange, unidentifiable call.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by telephone several times. The witness sounded very knowledgeable about local animal sounds and calls and very sincere about what they had heard. I went to the general location the night of the 19th and tried doing some calls and wood knocking. No answers were heard. It was too dark to do any field investigating while I was there and the witness has invited me back to the actual property during daylight hours. I have been investigating other sightings along the same general latitudinal line during their experience.",
