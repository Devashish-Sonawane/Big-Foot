The following details can be added to the report:--This was their first and only visit to the area.--Witness didn't think the \"howl\" was an animal at first, just the wind or other strange \"natural\" event.--The howl sounded male, and originated down in the canyon, about one mile away.  Sound was carried up the canyon to their camping spot.--The howl lasted for a minute.--Return call was further away.  Witness felt that there were two animals located in each drainage.--Witness didn't think \"Sasquatch\" until he saw the sign at the Strawberry Store mentioning a sighting near where they had camped.  He did some research and concluded that it was likely a Sasquatch he had heard based on that research.  ",

            "Observed": "I spoke to a elderly ojibwe lady who was on  her way to the Deer River White Oak Casino to do some gambling. She was driving east and about one mile east of Ball Club, Minnesota at about 11:00 P.M. she saw a brownish hairy manlike creature standing along the left side of highway 2. She said it looked like it was getting ready to cross the road toward Ball Club Lake. She was very scared and didn't want to slow down. She said this was about the time the Six Mile Lake tracks were spotted along a gravel road near Bena, Minnesota.",
            "State Population Density": "66.6",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the woman who viewed the large figure on the phone and the following additional details were revealed:  The woman isn\u0092t Ojibwe (O-'jib-wA); she\u0092s 67 yrs. old and from the Potawatomi (Pot\u0095a\u0095wat\u0095o\u0095me) tribe. Her husband is Ojibwe.She was driving 50 mph at 11:30 pm east bound on Hwy 2, one half mile east of Ball Club. She was using her low beams while at 50 yards past a turn when she saw a large figure standing three car lengths ahead on the right side of the road. It was standing 6 to 8 feet off the side of the road. She said it looked like it was waiting for her to pass and was waiting to cross to the lake 200 feet to the north. It didn\u0092t look at her; it looked ahead.She didn\u0092t get a real good look at it; she glanced at it. She could see the very large outline of it, 8 feet tall and brown in color. She wasn\u0092t able to give an estimate of its weight. She thought to herself at the time, \u0093That\u0092s no bear.\u0094 She knew what it was when she saw it, and chuckled when I suggested, \u0093Did it look like someone in a costume?\u0094 She was alone in the car and didn\u0092t slow down. She didn\u0092t need to get a good look at it to know what it was; she didn\u0092t see a lot of detail because of this. She had her windows rolled up and didn\u0092t notice any peculiar odors. She went back the next day during the day to see if she could find tracks, but when she got to the area she got a chill down her spine that kept her from getting out of the car and looking for tracks.The witness was straight forward and matter of fact about what she experienced. In her upbringing, Bigfoots aren\u0092t questioned if they exist or not. She answered, \u0093No, they\u0092re just there.\u0094 Some tribes believe that  the sighting of a Bigfoot is harbinger of bad things to come. This occurred two weeks after the track sighting on Six Mile Lake Rd., Report #14942. The track sighting is 9.75 miles directly west.I wasn\u0092t able to talk to the boy referred to in the \u0093Other Stories\u0094 section. He was fatally wounded in a hunting accident in the fall.",
