            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with her by phone.She was unable to be any more precise with the location than somewhere in the Pike National Forest west or northwest of Pikes Peak and will not discuss this with her family any further. She was open about her occupation, but very adamant that we not disclose it on the web site. Suffice it to say, her education and occupation makes her wildlife observation particularly valuable and credible.  She is certain that what she was looking at was not a bear. Due to her occupation, it is safe to safe that she would know the difference.She was worried that her story, connected with her name or even initials, could affect her career.  Sadly, she is probably right about that.Only a few additional details from the interview can be added. She listened to the loud breathing for what seemed to be a long time, maybe five minutes, but possibly as long as ten to twenty minutes. The \"chatter\" was not mumbling or muffled, not at all like birds or squirrels, but sounded like indistinct talking and was louder than the breathing. She could not tell if there was more than one source for the breathing and chatter but both were heard at each side of the window, near her feet and near her head. There was enough light from outside, a combination of moonlight and artificial light, to allow her to easily see the others inside the camper, and to slightly illuminate the eyes and face of the animal peering in the window. She was not as certain as to the coloring of the eyes, but noted that she could distinguish more than one shade in the mainly brownish eyes.David Petti",
