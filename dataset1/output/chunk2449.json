            "Observed": "I live in Denver, Colorado and I may have seen a bigfoot when I was in college in Boulder, Colorado several years ago. This occurred in November 1995. I was a freshman college student in Boulder, Colorado, and I used to like hiking in Chataqua Park nearby, which is higher than the rest of Boulder and faces the city. One night I was in Chataqua Park at about 11pm. It was cold and I was standing in my coat, looking down at the city lights. Suddenly, I heard a rustling sound and turned toward it. That's when I saw a large figure that was silhouetted against the city lights. It looked like a very large, hairy, naked person with a powerful build, broad shoulders, and a relatively small, pointed or bullet-shaped head. It spotted me, which made me afraid of being attacked, but instead it began running toward the cover of the trees. Its running gait was unlike that of any person I had seen. It was a kind of hunched-over, loping gait. Nevertheless, the figure moved quickly and disappeared behind a tree. That was all I saw of the figure. I have always considered this a possible bigfoot sighting.",

I was standing near the hiking trail that cuts through the middle of this park, and the creature I saw was standing some 30 meters away from me. We stood there for a few seconds, apparently trying to look at each other in the dark, and then the creature made its way toward the trees. It stepped behind a lone tree and that's when I lost track of it and didn't see it anymore.",

His sighting occurred in 1995 while he was a sophomore at CU in Boulder Colorado.  He had hiked up (alone) the slope about \u00bc mile from Chataqua Park parking lot that overlooks the city of Boulder to look at the city lights.  He had been standing there a few minutes when he heard  a rustling noise,  he turned to see a silhouette described as \u0093 a very large, hairy, naked person\u0094   about 100 feet away on a lightly wooded, grassy slope, then it immediately ran and disappeared behind a tree.  The sighting lasted approximately fifteen (15) seconds.  He was unnerved by the sighting and ran back to his car.  Not wanting to face ridicule from his fellow friends and students he waited 10 years to file this report.A note on the location, Chataqua Park sits to the west of the city of Boulder and borders the Roosevelt National Forest to the west.
