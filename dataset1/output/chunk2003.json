            "Follow-Up Report": "After conversing with the witness, the following can be added to this report:\"When I first saw the animal it looked like a bear to me because it was crouched down beside a tree in the treeline which made it look smaller in size and also the fact it was really dark in color. I nudged my husband who was beside me on our porch and told him to look at the bear. By the time I got his attention , the animal was still low to the ground but had shifted its position. It looked larger than once spotted but it was not in a full upright position as of yet.\"\"My husband, David, spends a lot of time outdoors and has seen just about every animal that our area has in the wilderness and told me that it was not a bear and for me to be quiet and watch. It stayed still for only a few moments until a deer jumped out of the treeline on the right of the animal. When the deer was close to this unknown animal it stood up on two legs and ran after the deer with astonishing speed. It chased the deer back into the woods and that was the last we saw of it. This animal was so large but yet it was very fast and moved with a graceful, fluid motion.\"\"It was so far away and happened so fast that I really didn't notice much more about it. And as of the arms, they only thing I could make out was that they looked longer than normal \"human\" arms and that when it ran, it looked like the animal carried them more towards the backside of its body instead of the side in which you would think they should be.\"\"It was a little over 100 yards from our position on the porch. This is why my husband wore his blaze orange hunting gloves to make the comparison. It made it very easy to see the position of his hands instead of taking guesses. When he got to the same tree we first saw the animal at, he got as close to the tree as he could and started to raise his hands above his head. I told him to stop at the spot I thought was closest to the top of the animals head and he said that it was at least 1.5 to 2 feet above his head. My husband is 5'9-5'10.\"\"After the height comparison he looked around for about two hours trying to see if he can find any tracks or anything else that might leave a clue as to what it was. There was nothing. We asked all of our surrounding neighbors if they have seen anything unusual and they all told us no. Some of them looked at us rather funny, but that was to be expected.\"\"We have moved since then but we still live in a heavily wooded area and in the same county. We have never seen anything like it since but we are keeping our eyes open. The place we live now is full of deer and other wildlife so we always keep an eye out. We know what we saw and we both know and feel deep down that we saw a Sasquatch that evening. Our family and friends either say we are crazy or are on the fence about believing in Sasquatch or not, but we know what we saw.\"The height estimate of the creature was between 7 1/2 and 8 feet.",

The eyes were at least 1 ft. apart! I thought at first it was a big owl but as we were pulling away we heard the most unbelievable scream. It scared my dad so bad that he stalled the truck trying to get out of there! As I look back on it that probably was not the proper response but things happen. We never went back to look for any signs but I have been back to the area since then and I believe that there is enough room to support at least a breeding pair of bigfoot/skunkape whatever it may be!",
