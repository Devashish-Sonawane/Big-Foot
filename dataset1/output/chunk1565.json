We had heard noises all evening near the building where we were working.  When we were leaving (around 10:00 P.M.) My friend pushed me aside and said to look towards a certain location.  He saw something, or someone, that was looking at us.  He had a rifle and shot into the air.  Whatever or whoever it was, it ran.  It was BIG! All I could observe about it was its large-stepping gait and how it managed to run through all the cars and bushes without hitting one thing in its path!!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The first encounter happened when he was a youth during the summer of 1968. He and his friends used to frequent a favorite swimming hole along a creek in the woods. A tree grows up from the embankment and hangs over the water. The witness was laying in the sun when his cousins started yelling. The witness glanced at an animal covered in dark hair hanging around the tree where they had just been playing 30 minutes previously. At first the witness thought it was a bear because it was crouched down around the tree. However, after the boys ran up the embankment onto the railroad tracks they turned and noticed this thing was following them. He described the trees swaying and pushed to the sides. They dove down into the thickets on the other side and ran home. The witness was not sure what the animal was but thought it unusual for even a bear to persue in that manner. He also added that whatever it was, did not persue them to the other side. The second incident occured in  April of 1980. He was at his family's place of business after hours and was working on a friends car 500-600 yards from the main office. While beneath the car, he heard footsteps coming up near the car. Thinking it was his friend or another employee, he asked for a wrench but no one responded. He also recalled hearing snorts, sneezing and bangs throughout the late afternoon. When he and his friend were locking up for the night they noticed a figure with head and hands peering around the corner from a building 15 to 20 yards away. His friend thinking it an intruder, shot his gun into the air and the figure took off into the woods. He said although it was night, he could make out the clear distinction of its head and hands due to a light on the outbuilding. He described the figure as all black, over 6 feet in height and about 3 feet wide. He described it as really fast and unusually nimble. It made heavy footfalls once in the woods. Both encounters and other bigfoot activity have occured on and near his family's auto repair business which consists of numerous acres of old cars and parts surrounded by creeks and mixed hardwoods. Although the witness now devotes most of his time to his family business, he was a science and algebra teacher in the state of SC for over 20 years; a very reputable and credible member of his community.",
