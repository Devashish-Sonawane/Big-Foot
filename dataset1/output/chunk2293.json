It had to be very strong because wen I came walking by, it stood up on two legs very fast and grabbed on to the tree behind it to help it up the hill.

He was building a tree fort in the forest about a quarter mile from his house in Wren, about 5 miles west of Philomath. He had been hammering at the structure for some time when he slipped and fell off the fort into shrubbery underneath it. As he righted himself, he found himself being watched by a sasquatch, about 12' away. He described the creature as being about his own height (5' 7\"), but with very wide shoulders reminiscent of those of a football player with shoulder pads, long arms with hands that reached below the kneecaps, and forearms that were more heavily muscled than the upper arms. It was black and shiny overall, apparently wet (the area abounds in swamps) and its hair obscured its face. After a momentary glance, it turned and left. The description suggests that he was observing the same individual on these two occasions.",
