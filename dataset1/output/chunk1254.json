I went to bed around 9:30pm on September 5th and it was a warm summer night approximately 70 degrees outside. I usually don\u0092t get much sleep as I get older and it seems to get worse the older I get. I had awakened at about 2 a.m. in the early morning of the 6th, I had decided to go outside and smoke a cigarette because I don\u0092t smoke in my house.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "A site visit was performed on 12/28/2013, and the following can be added to this report.I and Marc DeWerth were on the property for almost three hours with the witness and his son. The area lies at the end of a dead end road, and is down slope from all dwellings.  The field closest to the house has a row of pine trees that would obscure seeing anything, and it is about five feet lower than the witness' property. There are several fields next to the property, and one of these fields has a permanent deer feeding station.  The field had corn at the time.  Below that is an area that is swampy with cattails and other plants.  Next to this is the first creek, where the witness first noticed the animal.  He was accompanied by his son at the time and was approximately 35 yards away when he noticed the movement.  They noticed movement on the other side of the creek as it was between them and the animal.  They did not see it move off, and proceeded to head in that direction.  They crossed the first creek and they explored the area.  This creek headed into another feeder creek, which the crossed.  This path led them to the area where they encountered the odor.  After spending some time there, nothing else was noted.  They went back across the feeder creek, and were heading back to the house when the son noticed the animal from behind the tree.  Upon investigation, when I stood where they believed the animal was standing, we compared my size at six feet.  It was confirmed that it was about 7.5 feet tall. Also because of the site investigation it is believed that the animal was on the other side of the feeder creek using the tree as an obstruction.  The tree is approximately four feet wide.  The son, from where he stood, noticed and called his father to his position.  There they observed the animal peering around the tree from the opposite bank.  The tree helped to block their vision line.  They watched the animal for approximately a minute.  They believe they left the area before the animal did, at this point it was approximately forty yards from them.  They left because they felt it was time to do so.  The structures that were mentioned in this report were not observed due to the amount of time that had passed since the site visit and the sighting.The area has a history of reports.  The area has many farms, creeks, and lakes nearby.  There is a small meat packing plant just to the north.  Deer stands were still standing in December.  Deer tracks, raccoon tracks and turkey scratches were noted during the site visit.  ",
