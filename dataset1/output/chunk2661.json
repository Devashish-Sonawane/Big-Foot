On November 1st 2009 around 8:00 p.m. we saw something between the trees between our sight and the rest rooms. It was walking back and forth in the clearing and swaying back and forth in the same spot when it stopped to better see us through the opening in the trees. Nothing occured to us except it maybe have been some one but we were the only campers for miles. The following year in October 30th 2010 around 10:00 p.m. at the same location we were getting spooked by the area for no reason and we actually packed up and left when again there were no other campers and we heard what sounded like a large boulder about 75-100 yards away hit the ground with a great thud. No boulder rolling or crashing down a hill but like it was thrown or dropped out of the air. No smells or sightings except a few possible 11 inch tracks in the dirt a month prior while hunting in that area.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness telephonically.  His story seemed genuine and credible.  He had three separate incidents to report...Incident #1:  November 1, 2009The witness and his wife were camping at a public campground when they both noticed something walking amongst the trees near their camp late in the evening.  There were no artifical lights, but there was a bit of moonlight to provide some illumination.  They saw a large dark shape that appeared to be about six feet tall and very broad. Because of the intervening trees, they could not make out any distinct features, but the husband was able to see that the subject was walking on two legs.  It was obvious the subject knew the witness and his wife were present because it stopped and seemed to be looking at them through the trees.  It swayed back and forth a bit as it did this.There were no other campers in the campground at the time.  The couple became a bit spooked by what they were seeing, so they immediately packed up camp and left.Incident #2:  October 30, 2010The witness and his wife were again camped in the same campground.  They had been hunting during the day, but had had an uneasy feeling for much of the day.  The weather was cold, with a little bit of snow fall.  Some time between 11:00 PM and Midnight they both heard a very loud THUD sound.  It sounded to the witness as if a very large rock had landed on the ground.  Again, there was no one else in the campground, and there were no nearby cliffs from which a rock could have fallen.  The combination of their earlier uneasiness and the sound of a large rock landing near their camp prompted them to once again pack up and leave.  This time, they didn't even bother folding up their tent.  They simply threw it into their vehicle and left immediately.Incident #3: Late August 2010The witness and his wife were in a different campground when his wife woke him at about 2:00 AM to say she was hearing odd noises.  The witness described the noises as a series of knocks that were quite loud and sounded like \"wood-on-wood\" stikes.  The witness listened to these noises for about half an hour.  He said they would come in a series of two or three knocks and that they seemed to be coming from three different locations on the hillsides above the campground.There were a couple other campers in this campground at the time, but the witness felt it was unlikely any of those campers were doing the wood knocks.  He didn't feel it was credible to assume that three different people would climb up a very steep hillside at 2:00 AM simply to whack something against a tree.The witness did not feel alarmed by the woodknocks and eventually went back to sleep.______________________________________Editor's Notes (Matt Moneymaker):Location # 1 - Boiling Springs CampgroundView Larger Map__________________________________________________________________________________________________Location # 2 - Willow Creek Campground (below)View Larger Map",
