            "Follow-Up Report": "The report above was the initial submission by the family member who contacted us first. Her report does not mention the Class A incident. The Class A incident was described shortly after this first contact.I began correspondence with the witness and her family beginning in February of 2006. She resides in Michigan and stated that she has relatives that live near Hot Springs, NC. Her grandfather owns a large tract of land in the mountains which serves as the meeting place for the extended family reunion, every summer. The incident she mentions above happened on one of the days of the reunion. Because of a prior sighting, a family member had previously purchased a copy of the Sierra Sounds recordings (which has recordings of various bigfoot vocalizations, including aggressive chatter). The evening after the rain had stopped they played the Sierra Sounds CD and shortly thereafter they heard pacing on the ridge behind them at approximately 100 feet in distance. In addition to the pacing, they heard branches breaking and a tree was thrown down the ridge at them. The family left the campfire and went inside. I also interviewed the woman's brother. He was one of the two men who had Class A sightings in August 2001, again during the family reunion on the mountain. This is the incident that got them interested in the subject originally, and led to them obtaining a copy of the Sierra Sounds recordings: The brother and his cousin were hiking up an old logging road near the grandfather's property and decided to take a break on a bluff overlooking a ravine. A rock the size of a \"volleyball\" was hurled at them from above. They looked and saw a bigfoot-like animal 40 yards away staring at them. It was squatted down with its elbows on its toes. Its arms were massive and its hands were large. It was covered in reddish brown hair and its chin was tucked down. It was a girthy animal; three and a half to four feet from back to front. He said its hair was straggly and there were no visible ears. It was squatted back on its calves. The brother and cousin ran down the mountain to the trailhead. They returned home, shaken by what they saw. In August of 2006, BFRO investigators Leigh Culver (GA-BFRO), Jason Vogan (NC-BFRO), Nick Wamboldt (GA-BFRO) and myself (NC-BFRO) met with the family on their property. We had previously asked them to call us if more things happened around the property. They called and told us activity the night before. They wanted us to come see for ourselves the next night. Before we arrived the family had gathered around a fire outside their home. They said they heard a wood knock several yards off into the thick treeline. The knock caused the family to go back inside the house.When we arrived we looked around the area for anything of interest. We found a possible track on the nearby mountainside where the brother and cousin had their sighting a few years before.  Various family members told stories of rocks and logs being thrown at them. Two weeks later a BFRO expedition (the first NC expedition) focused on this area for a few days before moving on. They eventually followed the highest ridgeline to a rainforest-like area near the Appalachian Trail where some distinctive sounds were eventually heard by most of the participants.The Pisgah Nat. For. zone in western NC is mountainous and sparsely populated. It is north and east of Smokey Mountains National Park, which straddles the Tennessee border. Portions of the Pisgah region get a lot of rain. Those areas are mossy and ferny and full of wildlife. The distinctive sounds on the NC expedition were heard in one of these rainforest-like zones in the high country.
