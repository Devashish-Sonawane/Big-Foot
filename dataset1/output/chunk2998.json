This mountainous area that the eleven thousand-foot Mt. Graham is located in, is an island in the desert southwest, and its roads are closed from November through April due to the deep snow conditions.  This area has numerous springs and also has elk, deer and bear with in its natural boundaries.  The main reason Heath reported this incident is that the screaming sounds that he and his friends heard were on our BFRO web sight, and they were identical to the screams that was witnessed on that 1995 camping trip.
