            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for about 30 minutes and found her to be very curious about her sighting and also very detailed. She describes herself as having camped and hiked her whole life. She's very comfortable with the outdoors, very nature oriented and said the group as a whole were all very \"outdoorsy\". There were three men and three women in their party. They were camping in Malakoff Historical State Park in a remote, very large site for a total of 4 days/three nights; the mentioned incident was on the 2nd night at around 11pm. She heard a definite bipedal sound like a very large man running up behind her through the brush west of their campsite (off trail). This would have been downhill from their campsite among bushes and trees. She said despite the terrain the animal  ran cleanly and without impediment. She said that everyone in their group heard it. She shined a flashlight in the direction of the running and 10-12 feet away from her saw illuminated a pair of yellowing green eyes roughly 6 ft off the ground. She say no other body features. She immediately went into a \"fight or flight\" response, dropped the flashlight, and ran behind the group. Immediately after this a small rock was thrown behind the group and they then heard a quiet, bipedal retreat of the animal. She says the first night they were there they all heard several tree breaks n the distance, but just assumed they were \"regular forest noises\". She also mentioned that at the time she was menstruating and had woken up a few times the previous night and had urinated in the general vicinity of the sighting. ",
