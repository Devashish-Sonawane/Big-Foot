            "Follow-Up Report": "On Wednesday, April 22nd 1997 BFRO Researcher, Scott M., contacted the witness by phone for a follow up interview.  The story remained steadily consistent with the original report of nearly a month ago.  A few more details about the animal seen were described:  The witness described that the animal did not appear threatened by them at all, and as they ran (the two brothers) the witness looked over his shoulder and the animal appeared to simply watch them, then it went about its business as it was doing before (running its hands through the may apple patch)  The submitter did correct something from his earlier report, he stated originally that his brother also saw the creature, but when asked if he actually saw something, he stated that he did not, but he ran because his brother (the submitter) simply yelled at him to run.  The animal witnessed was 5 foot to 6 foot tall, and medium brown in color, it was stocky but not fat, but appeared \"in shape\".  It had a low forehead, like a gorilla and a square jaw, it was described as looking like a cross between a man and a gorilla.  It had long arms, but not overly long like a gorilla, and its arms were covered by shaggy hair.  No facial features were discerned, and no attempts to return to the site to look for either the creature or evidence of it were made.  The witness is believable, and stated that he cannot rule out that it was a man in a costume, but he feels that is highly unlikely since the location was rarely visited, and a person in a costume could have had a long wait on their hands, and no one knew they were going out to the location.  The inhabitants of the area were older farmers, and not prone to wearing gorilla costumes on the farm.  As stated, the witness said he cannot rule out a costume, but he feels it was actually a bigfoot, and not a hoaxer. ",
