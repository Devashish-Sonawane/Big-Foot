            "Observed": "I never gave much thought to bigfoot, especially living in Kansas.  I heard stories when I was a kid.  I was out for a walk by myself on a nice spring day enjoying nature and getting some peace and quiet away from my children.  I like to walk down to the Ninnescah River, so I went to the closest bridge by our house.  I walk quietly so I can hear everything around me, I practice listening to everything and using all my senses when I walk.  I got to the edge of the bridge at the river and I stopped as I saw a figure squatting down at the edge of the river.  First I thought it was a homeless person or local, but then I noticed they were covered in hair, so then I wondered why someone would be dressed in a bigfoot costume at this remote area by the river, then I looked around to see if there was anyone else filming trying to pull a hoax or something- you never know what the teenagers will do these days.  There was no one, and that's when I started noticing other details that pointed to the reality of the situation.  The bigfoot was breaking open mussels or clams or whatever and then eating them, which made me think 'Who would eat that raw from this dirty river where there is trash laying around?'.  That's when it fully dawned on me that this was not a human.  It was covered in a brown hair/fur.  It was squatting with its back towards me the whole time, it never looked back at me, and I didn't move until I turned and left to go home to try to get my phone to take a picture (which it was dark by the time I got home and there was nothing there when I got back).  It just kept opening mussels and eating them, and it would hit them on the rocks to break them open.  It had long arms, and it squatted flat footed, which I thought would be a difficult position to hold, as I squat with my heels up off the ground.  It's hands were shaped more like human hands, but the color was darker and the texture was kind of like gorilla/ape hands.  I couldn't say for sure how tall it was, but it seemed younger, probably 6+ foot or 7 foot tall, but I'd have to have someone help me determine how big it really was.  When I came back I didn't want to get down in the area because there are snakes around here.  I couldn't believe what I had seen, and didn't tell anyone, even my family, because this is Kansas.  I did make them squat to see if they did it flat footed- ha!  I also take them to the river whenever we go for walks.  I tried to get my husband to go for walks with me, so maybe he would see one, too, but he won't go for walks with me.  After the show aired I told my family about what I saw, now he might go for a walk with me!  I didn't think about reporting this to your site until Finding Bigfoot came to the very river I saw one at, and it clicked that Matt was the head of the BFRO and you might want to hear about this incident.  I saw it and I still can't believe it, why would anyone else believe it?  We live a couple blocks from the river, so if any investigators want to come check it out, you are welcome to stay here or base out of here.  I do have three children at home still, but we have a clean, nice, newer house with a couple guest rooms.  If anyone wants to search around the Ninnescah River I would suggest doing it in the spring or fall when we have more wildlife and the weather is nicer.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length. She did provide extra details during our conversation, and in an additional email the next day.When she goes for walks, she \"walks in silence\". Likes to hear nature, not her footsteps. She felt like this was the reason the creature never saw or heard her. It was hyper focused on eating the clams/mussels. It was no more than 30 feet away, its back was to her. It was breaking the shells open with its hands, and also breaking the hard to open ones over a rock. Some it ate by just pouring it into its mouth, as a human would eat an oyster. Other times it would hold the shell in one hand and pull the meat out with the other and feed itself that way. The hands were leathery, absolutely human/apelike. The hair was brown/reddish brown. The red came out as the sun hit it at certain angles. The \"undercoat\" was matted and a bit darker. She did mention that it reminded her of the color of an orangutan. She felt it was a female, and that was due to mannerisms and a \"slight\" physique. She \"just felt the movements were gentle and feminine\". It could have been a juvenile as well. There was no genitalia viewed that would give her a clue. She saw the muscles rippling as it moved in its squatting position, mostly legs and arms. The arms were \"very long\", \"longer that humans, more like apes\". It did not lean forward much to get the mussels, as its elbows \"almost reached the ground in it's squatting position\". It had \"very thick legs\". She was amazed that it could squat flat footed, and she tried to repeat that stance when she got home, and found it very difficult, if not impossible, to repeat that position. The sighting lasted at least 3 minutes, and perhaps as long as 5 minutes. It never looked back at her direction, or at anything else for that matter. It was just focused on eating. She backed away slowly until it was out of sight, then turned and went home to get her phone camera to video it. By the time she got home she had gotten distracted by home life, and the thought that it would be gone by the time she got back, and no one would believe her anyway. She sat on this incident until she saw the Kansas show of Finding Bigfoot, and finally realized that this actually happened. The entire time we were speaking, she kept saying the whole thing was surreal, like a dream, and could not possibly happen to her, especially in Kansas.",

            "Observed": "I think it was in the spring of about 1998-99, my ex-husband woke me up at about three in the morning. We lived in Atlanta at the time, which is about half way between Gaylord and Alpena. He woke me up and was visibly shaken, he was saying \"Come here to the back porch, you gotta hear this\". I went with him to the sliding glass door on the back porch and heard the most God-awful sound I have ever heard in my life. We had 40 acres on a corner lot and this was comming from the state owned woods to our south-west. It sounded like someone or something was dying. It was terrible and it went on every 30 seconds or so for almost an hour. I have heard the other animals in the area before....bobcat, coyote, fox, birds, etc., this was nothing like that! It was very eerie and haunting. Also, that following summer when I was comming home from work, I was comming down one of the many dirt \"back roads\" to get home and I saw, what at first I thought might be a horse, running very fast through some VERY THICK swamp. I truned to look at it and it was out of sight or had stopped and was hiding. I think it might have decided to squat down and hide once the car stopped. It was HUGE and moving faster than any person or bear could.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke at length with the witness by phone. The incident where she heard the screaming, may or may not be sasquatch related.  The home was only a couple miles through the woods from her brief sighting.  The sighting occured while she was coming home from work.  She was traveling a back way home, on a rather remote, secluded road.  At first she thought of a horse while watching the animal running through the woods because of the size and speed it traveled.  She then realized what she was looking at was upright and running bipedally.  She clearly seen the arms swinging as it ran and could see the legs moving from around the knees up.  She had her windows down and did hear one loud crack as the animal apparently stepped on a branch.  The witness only seen the animal from a side view but was amazed at how thick the upper torso was.  She estimated the height at around eight feet.   The color appeared black or very dark brown, but was in a shaded area, so exact color was hard to determine.  What impressed the witness most, beside the size of the animal was how fast it was able to negotiate the thick wooded area it ran through with lots of brush and debris. The witness looked away to watch the road for a second and when she looked back, the animal was gone. At that point the witness just wanted to get home, which required traveling through this secluded area and she feared running into the animal again, which she did not.  I recently traveled to the area of  the sighting and it is a mixture of thick swampy terrain and thick hardwood forest.  It would provide plently of hiding areas, as well as plentiful food sources.   It is also in a general area of several other sightings.Atlana is known as the \"Elk Capital of Michigan\" because of its famous elk herd in the Pigeon River Region of the northern Lower Peninsula.",
