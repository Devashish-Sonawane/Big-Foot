It was a small and shallow brook layered with 5-10 lbs rocks, so we washed off, cooled down and as we were leaving the brook it was out of sight but not sound, we heard some noises of rocks moving and colliding or being tossed into other rocks. We were nervous of a wild animal. As we approached we heard like a hog running off, only we caught a glimpse of an ape like mammal charging through and away from the brook. The rocks on the bank and in the water were moved and jumbled in a very distinct way.  Because of the leaves, there was no other prints except one upper left side of a left foot imprinted in the mud touching the water.  We tried to preserve it, but as we returned to the cars, the mud had fried and cracked, we had no camera, sorry.",

Upon coming to the brook they heard what they described as 'a hog running off' but instead witnessed an 'ape-like' mammal on two legs charging through and away from the brook and into some thick brush, which lasted only seconds.-They described it as being 'about 7 foot tall, with bulky shoulders and huge body'. It had black, hanging, or 'fuzzy' hair and their overall impression of the creature was that it was 'strong'. They stated that it had 'big' hands but they could not see the feet and lower legs because of the thick brush, and they both commented on how surprised they were that it could get through such thick undergrowth so easily. -They stated that when it 'charged' through the brush, it was very loud in that it broke thick limbs and small trees in its path and left an 'indescribably bad, trashy' odor behind. -After the sighting they found a partial 'mushy' heel print near the edge of the brook that was 'big' and 'twice the width' of their heels, and they also stated that the rocks on the edge of the brook were 'disturbed and moved in a distinct way'. -They were in the confines of the Apalachicola National Forest which is bordered by the Ocala and Osceola National forests, a combined acreage of almost 1.2 million acres of undeveloped forests, swamps, rivers, lakes and inlets.
