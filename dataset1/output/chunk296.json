            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. He was riding dirtbikes on Poinciana Rd. with his friend when they came to a dead end. The witness happened to look back to where they just came from and noticed a large dark figure crossing the road at the bend. As this figure was crossing, a car was coming from the opposite side, and the figure picked up its pace and as it approached the far side of the road, it reached out as if to grab the fence post. The witness could see a road sign just past the figure, the figure was taller, and he described the color as dark brown with grey. Even at the distance of 200 meters, he should have seen clothing colors. He did not. This surprised the witness as it was out of place and he knew there was nothing but a field where the figure crossed. The witness' friend was on a dirtbike next to him and he yelled to see if he'd seen it, but his friend was looking down at his GPS. Since the witness' dirtbike was still running, he put it in gear and was at the spot within 15 seconds. He looked to where it should be and saw nothing. The tree line was 400 ft away and it didn't seem possible that this figure could have jumped the fence, and crossed the field that fast, even at a dead run. The witness had no explanation for it. ",

I grew up in Hunt County, Horton Bottoms. Every ten years, it vocalizes near my mothers house and I have had numerous run ins with it. As of now, it is very active here. Less than a week ago, we met again. To me, it sounds like a human on a bull horn calling cows in for the night, but gosh it's so friggin loud, it vibrates your whole body.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness and hiked with him in one of the several locations that he is researching. I found him to be very credible, possessing excellent knowledge of local flora and fauna. His woodcraft and tracking skills are superb. An avid hunter and fisherman, he often spends a week or more in the field, searching for artifacts, fossils, and bigfoot evidence. He has had many encounters but says he has yet to experience a clear daylight sighting. I also spoke on the phone with his father who has had numerous encounters, many when with this witness and some alone. Most of what they have experienced are vocalizations, but the witness showed me an excellent track casting he made that is approximately 14 inches in length. He has photos and video of dead coyotes that were killed and left, for him only to find, he believes. Their bodies indicated evidence that the coyotes were crushed and bones broken by hands. He compares his hands in the video with the markings on the coyote body and concludes that the grip span was far larger than his own. He surmises that they were left to intimidate him.  I hope to spend more time investigating with him in the future.",
