I came around a corner in the path and got scared because I saw what I thought was some large dark person laying down next to the path taking a rest and looking at me.  I could not discern any features and could not tell if it was a log or a person, but something made me stop and stare.  I kept blinking trying to get the nerve to get closer, but I could not see clearly enough.  I went back the way I came.  Since this was a path I used regularly I couldn't remember if a log was there or what that could have been.  This might not be worth mentioning.",
