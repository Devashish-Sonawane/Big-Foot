            "Follow-Up Report": "===================================Here's the link to download and discuss this footage is:http://s2.excoboard.com/exco/forum.php?forumid=160123===================================After seeing this footage I traveled to this location in Daniel Boone National Forest, to set out some \"no glow\" (Reconyx RC60 - totally invisible) trail cameras on the same hillside. I was there for a few days, and was on that hill every night ... every night there was severe summer thunderstorms. Nothing notable happened for the few days that I was there.I set up four separate cameras at trail choke points. The plan was to leave them there for about a month, or at least through one full moon cycle. The cameras were retrieved 5 weeks later but only got a couple of feral dogs and some other animals. No humans walked by the cameras.There was moonlight when this footage was obtained. You can actually see the moon in the footage. It's the object that looks like a single bright light high up in the trees. In some shots it appears above and to the left of the eyeshine.  The moon appears smaller in this footage than what you would expect. That effect is caused by the optics of the camcorder.The camcorder sweeps by the moon a few times in the footage. Chuck makes no mention of it as he pans around.You can also hear vehicles driving by in the distance. There is a highway about 1/3 of a mile from this ridge. At one point in the footage you can see the headlights of a car moving along the highway. They appear well below and to the left of the eyeshine.Many witnesses have described \"glowing eyes\" rather than just reflective eyeshine. In those cases the witnesses were confident that the eyes were glowing because the eyes were relatively bright, in situations where there was no bright illumination to reflect. The eyes were often amber in color.In this case there was some illumination -- the infrared illuminator from the Sony nite-shot camcorder. Pam's inability to see the eyeshine may have been due to obstructions from her viewing angle, or because she didn't look in the right direction at the right time. Or it might have been reflected infrared light from the nite-shot camcorder.  Or the eyes may have been a very dim red (as has been describe many times by eyewitnesses) and thus were not bright enough, nor distinct enough for Pam to notice them when she looked in that general direction.  Through the eye of a Sony nite-shot, all sources of illumination will appear white, no matter what their true color. The nite-shot is also much more sensitive to light than human eyes. Thus even a small amount of dim red light will appear relatively bright and white in color through this type of camera.In case you missed it above, the link to download and discuss this footage is:http://s2.excoboard.com/exco/forum.php?forumid=160123",
