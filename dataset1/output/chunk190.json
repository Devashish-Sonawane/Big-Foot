            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness via phone. He's a police officer. His report is brief but factual. He and a buddy had gone to a family pond and found numerous fish broken in half on the bank. They were bones only and no meat was left. But they were broken nearly perfectly in half and just left on the bank. They were not stepped on. The skeletons were intact and the supposition was they were cut or broken upon catching them and the bones/carcass were dropped on the spot. They had not been moved as far as they could tell.After about half an hour, his buddy had to run behind some trees to relieve himself. While he was waiting for him to return, he heard a noise. He looked over in the direction of the noise and saw the creature. It was standing behind a tree which did not fully hide it. It did the standard tree peeking, but moving from one side of the tree to the other. It then stepped back, took a stride to the right and became fully exposed. That is when the witness took off running back towards his friend's grandma's house. The color was a \"dark reddish brown\" and brunette somewhat sums the color up. There was a low hanging branch on the tree and it was checked out later, and 8 ft. in height is accurate. The entire event lasted around 15 seconds. He sat on this for the last 10 years and being in a small town He did not want the attention and or ridicule he knew was coming. His dad had been on him to come forward, and he finally did. Good for him. I could sense it was a relief. ",
