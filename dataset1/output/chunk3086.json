            "Follow-Up Report": "Investigator Jim Thompson and I went to meet with the witness in February 2018. Upon arriving, I asked him to explain the events to Jim so he had a better understanding of the situation. I also played some howls for him to use as a comparison to what he had heard and the 1994 Ohio Moaning Howl was nearly identical. He also explained the screams he heard which sounded like a woman's screams. After he told us what all had happened since early Fall, we walked out to the area where he had seen the tracks and heard the screams and howls. Having grown up in the area, I am familiar with the terrain and lay of the land. This particular hollow ties together several small communities and eventually leads to the Ohio River area. The hollow stretches for approximately 20 miles with several other deep hollows and ravines branching from it. There are several creeks, streams, and ponds as well as an abundance of wildlife. The majority of these hollows follow Wheeling Creek. At times the terrain can be very hilly and thick. One other report filed with the BFRO (currently under investigation) reports a road crossing about 3-4 miles from this location. Looking down into the hollow:Photos of the tracks taken by the witness on January 21:Photo of a possible track remnant taken by the witness a few days later:We walked over to the area of the woods he stated the tracks came out of to get the vantage point of any animal that would be leaving the woods to come into the open. Photos of one's vantage point as you would approach the edge of the wood line (where the tracks came out of):It was a well hidden area that I could see about a 270 degree view of what was in front of me with little chance of anyone seeing me. An animal, creature or human could easily duck into cover quickly if they needed to remain hidden. There were remnants of possible tracks when we were there, but there were several days of heavy rains prior to our investigation, so they could not be casted. The witness was very sincere about what was going on and agreed to keep in contact with me if any other evidence appeared.",

            "Observed": "While out deer huntning myself and my wife found a set of tracks alongside Forest service road 2302. This road starts on Forest service road 406 and travels for approximately 1.5 miles before dead-ending on a hilltop. The tracks were approximately .75 miles up the road just past a clearing. These tracks were about 16\" long and 7\" wide. The toe prints were clearly visable. It had rained earlier that morning and had light showers intermittently throughout the morning. The tracks had no water puddling in them and appeared to be fairly fresh. I have been a avid hunter for many years and can distinguish between fresh and old tracks. I never have been a believer in the Bigfoot stories and legends but have since changed my attitude. I didn't really believe what I had found until I took my wife up and showed her. She agreed that they could, in fact, be Bigfoot prints.",
