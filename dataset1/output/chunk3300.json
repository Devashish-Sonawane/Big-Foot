            "Observed": "I was hunting in my uncles timber. The time was about 5:30 so I decided to head out. I was walking back to my truck following a well traveled trail and heard a noise on the north side of the dried up river bed. I looked over and drew my gun thinking it might be a deer. as i followed it with my scope, I noticed it was way bigger than a deer. It probably stood 2 foot taller than a deer or human. It was sollid black, covered in hair, and was running away from me at an incredible speed. the reason i'm saying that is because it was in dense brush. i got scared, because i couldnt explain what i had just seen. so i ran to my truck and left.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "In a phone interview witness added important details to his report. The dried up riverbed that was between witness and the creature was 30 to 40 yards wide, with trees in the bottom. The creature was therefore 30 to 40 yards away when observed. Witness returned to the area with a friend and stood next to trees where the creature had been seen. His height was nowhere near the height of the creature. Witness could not see the face of the creature as it was running away, but it had an elongated head. It was running very fast, like a person would move, through dense woods quite easily even though there was no trail. The creature held its arms up at shoulder height and made boxing-like movements as it ran. Its arms were muscular and good definition could be seen through the back hair. The same was true of the legs, with the lower legs as thick as the upper. Witness has not been able to go back into the woods without someone else, stating that something with that much mass could do a lot of damage. Once the creature was out of sight witness took off in a dead sprint back to his truck. Witness was 24 years old at the time of the sighting and has a lot of outdoor experience. The witness is credible. The area of the sighting is a small third order perennial river that drains into a larger tributary river of the Mississippi River in the southeastern portion of Iowa. The valley is densely wooded and surrounded by farmland. The greenbelt formed by the timber along the river is contiguous all the way to the Mississippi River which is approximately 30 linear miles away if you follow the general path of the rivers. The weather was unseasonably warm in the Upper Midwest during the fall of 2006, with a mean average temperature in the area of the sighting of 51 degrees Fahrenheit in October and 44 degrees Fahrenheit in November.",

            "Observed": "It was the middle of the day on a summer day when I pulled into this park that we used to frequent as teenagers, frolicking in the falls. There were only two cars in the parking lot including mine. This park was never known to be crowded. I went and sat on top of a picnic table that was parallel to the start of the winding path toward the falls/creek. I lit a cigarette and was only sitting there for about a minute when I felt this urge to turn around. About six feet from where I sat I saw this Yeti from the waist up only because there was a four foot drop-off where the winding path continued. When I saw it, I turned back around in disbelief then turned around again to confirm that I did see this thing. It's eyes were a gold/yellow, it was covered in brown fur, and in a hunched position. I was so scared I couldn't move. I was frozen in fear! Just at that precise second a bus full of disabled teens with their caretakers were exiting their bus and proceeded to walk on the path a few feet in front of me. I tried to open my mouth and tell them not to go down there, but I was still in shock by what was so close behind me. Once their group had passed me I somehow got up and ran to my car which was only about 100 yards from me. I have never been back to that park since that day.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness noted that the creature's eyes were gold/yellow in color and looked almost luminous. The face was flat with hair on the cheeks and the skin was a light brown in color. Since the creature was standing behind a four foot wall it was easy to estimate the animal to be between eight and nine feet tall. It was very bulky, with medium length hair. When the group of disabled teens and their caretakers walked by nobody noticed the creature behind her.",
