            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and I met at the location.  The fence post was not very thick or strong so the break was not too impressive.  The post may have broke when it was used as a guide to clear the fence. The barbed wire that was found pushed down the next day had already been repaired. The height of the dark brown/black creature was estimated by comparing it to the witness' Ford Bronco and the 4 ft. tall fence.  Very credible witness who has spent his life fishing, hunting and ATVing in this area.  The location is very close to a school and brand new housing developments, but it is also close to protected wilderness and farms.  Thru this witness I have been introduced to other witnesses and told of other sitings in this same general area.   ",

I was traveling 35-40 mph and the animal appeared to glide across the road at an extremely fast speed. It was literally a blur until it was directly in my headlights. It appeared to be running on two legs with a heavy upper body. It also appeared to cross the road in two strides. I slammed my brakes and turned towards the farm field it ran into. There was nothing in site. The ground was frozen which is why I believe there was no tracks. There is not any animal that lives, that could explain what I saw.",

He remembers the color to be black and brown, with hair longer on the top. The shape was that of an upright figure, quickly striding across the road, approx.50 feet in front of his vehicle. He saw the figure for 4-5 seconds. The movement was fast, upright at first, then ducked down as it moved. The upper part of the body seemed much larger than the bottom, and because it was tall, was above his headlights. There were street lights on the two way road providing some visibility. He estimated the weight to be well over 400 pounds.When stopped and out of the car, he said he felt nervous, said it looked \"as wide as a large couch standing on end.\" He did not see any facial features.This sighting is relatively close to the Eastern suburbs of Appleton.
