Our son was in the vehicle but he was lying down in the back seat.  When we reached a set of guardrails something suddenly appeared directly in front of us.  It was tall and dark.  It then disappeared off to the east.",

They were driving south on M-156 when they seen a dark-haired figure move across the road in front of their car.  They estimated that it was definitely over 6 feet tall, and probably between 7-8 feet tall.  They were driving about 50 mph and it appeared right in front of them. They thought they were going to hit it; the figure moved across the road extremely fast, in about 3 steps, and was gone.  Overall, the sighting lasted only a few seconds.  There was another witness driving another car the opposite way, who was farther away from the incident.  That witness stopped his car after the creature crossed the road.  They were never able to get in touch with this witness.  Both witnesses remember this as if it happened yesterday.  It remains very vivid, and they say they will never forget it.  ",
