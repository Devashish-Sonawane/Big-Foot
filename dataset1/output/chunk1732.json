            "Follow-Up Report": "While speaking with Mr. Robertson, he added that the bottom of the canyon is very moist with seeps, marsh, beaver ponds, and lush grass.  The surrounding vegetation includes conifer/aspen on the north facing slope and sage on the south facing slope.  The canyon formerly was his usual hunting grounds due to the regular movement pattern of the local elk herd and remoteness from human traffic.The screams were heard within a 30-second time frame. There were between 3 and 5 screams and they were very similar to recordings he heard about 1999 on www.bigfootsounds.com.  They originated from the canyon below and \"the volume blew us away\";.  The sound went from a low range to a high range and \"rocked the canyon\";.  It didn't occur to them at the time to go down into the canyon to look for footprints where he is sure they would have been visible in the soft wet ground.Mr. Jackman, the hunting partner, was most impressed by the \"sterility\" of the woods after the screams where usually they're quite \"fertile\", referring to the disappearance and silence of the usually abundant wildlife.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness (H.M) had a second sighting in a 3.5 year period at the same location, behind his home. The first sighting occurred in early fall around 6:30 pm. The witness was cooking hot dogs while camping. HM heard a growl coming from behind about 10 yards away. Following the sound he spotted a large figure about 7-8 feet tall watching him. HM thought it was someone playing games, he called out \u0093Hey\u0094, the creature then ran into the tree line. At the time no real visual description was seen just a tall bulky figure. The next day HM went to where he had seen the creature and he found possible footprints, comparing his boot size (13) and adding an additional 6\", made the foot depressions 18\u0094 long. Due to heavy leaf litter no casts were made.The second sighting took place March of 2013 around 9 pm. HM had been outside and heard something heavy crunching leaves. He was surprised to see a large 8-9 foot figure standing under a security light watching him. HM described the creature as very large, around 500 pounds, arms past its knees, dark brown in color, a side view of a chest 1 \u00bd foot wide, with a slight \"beer belly\" The hair/fur was described as about 3-4 inches long and fluffy like. The head came to a point, sort of oval.  The witness whistled at the creature which turned to look at HM, then moved off to the wood line with a long stride. No vocals were heard and no tracks or other evidence was found.  The creature had been walking behind some trailers that sat close to the edge of the woods, near some trash dumpsters. It was apparently using the trailers for cover. His mother confirmed this event with me, although she didn't see anything.The area has a 3 mile strip that is populated then turns into acres of timber. There is an elk farm just a few miles down the road. Plenty of deer are present, along with many water resources.",
