            "Also Noticed": "Unusual things, like that feeling of terror, no other sounds, or smells. Also, there were no tracks, because the ground was too hard. The trail was very old and it had been used a lot. One area had worn steps that were out of sync to my steps.  I just had that bad feeling and the hairs on the back of my neck stood out.  I have never had that before or since. This animal was not afraid or interested in me. I could find the trail again, but I will not divulge the location except by stringent interviewing.",

I found this trail that was going up the mountain, where their were large steps in the trail that were throwing my climbing stride off. At this point, this side of the mountain, that I was on, was bald and it was open ground with no trees or brush close by to hide behind.",

Some of them are: that bear dogs would not run these animals, they would just whine and rub up against there owners legs, acting terrified. A young girl saw one cross road near dusk, and go into the dark woods.  These people seemed honest about what they saw.  While living in Takilma Oregon, in my cabin on the Illinois River, I heard a call sounding exactly like a great ape out of a zoo.  On another night, when I was in Young\u2019s Valley California I heard a hooting call repeated several times coming from Preston Peak area, this also sounded exactly like a great ape out of a zoo.",

I have combined the both of them here.  Lou was very adamant and sincere about what took place on that California mountain trail in the spring of 1978.Lou was very believable about his prospecting activities in that area, because I can relate to some of what he is talking about. Lou seems well educated and informed in that field and knows that area.  Lou stated that he was never armed while on these prospecting trips.Now, as to what Lou experienced on that mountain trail in 1978, I will have to leave that up to your knowledge of this creature.  I made this a Class \u201cB\u201d report because he actually never saw it, he just heard it walk by while he was in a fetal position, with his hands covering his eyes.",
