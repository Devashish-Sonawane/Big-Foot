The sounds of twigs breaking started as soon as their own feet were quiet. He said it sounded like they were surrounded. They would first hear a snap on one side of them, then the other. However, the witness'  feeling is that it was one animal, making it seem as though there was a second. He is not sure how he could not have seen what was chasing him.Concerning the vocalization, he told me that it started low and grew in intensity. The witness said that it conveyed to him that he was in no way supposed to be there.He wanted to cut his stay at his cousin's home short, leaving not long after this. His cousin continues to brush the incident off.",
