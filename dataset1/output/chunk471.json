            "Observed": "I currently have a job as a test driver and i spend a lot of time driving on alligator alley (I-75 between Naples and Ft. Lauderdale) and on many of the other roads out in the everglades. One about 2 weeks ago I was driving east along alligator alley when something got my attention out of the corner of my eye. Off to the right side of the road I saw what appeared to be a hairy animal standing about 6 ft. tall, it appeared to be standing in a clearing about 20 ft. south of the canal that follows the roadway.",
            "foot size.2": "n",
            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was contacted about this sighting and the following additional information was provided:\u0095\tThe witness travels this route on a regular basis for his test driving job. This particular day he was traveling eastbound caravan style with three other vehicles, which made up the \u0093driving group\u0094 he mentioned. The weather was sunny, temperature in the 80s.\u0095\tSomething caught his eye to the right of the roadway, and he turned his head and viewed the creature for an estimated 3-4 seconds.  He estimated the closest distance between him and the creature to be approximately 50 feet.\u0095\tWhat he saw was upright and \u0093casually walking\u0094 in the opposite direction (westbound).  Swinging arms were seen, \u0093somewhat longer than human arms.\u0094  He could see the entire body down to the ankles where tall grass concealed the feet.\u0095\tIn addition to his height estimate of six feet, the witness estimated its weight to be between 350 and 400 pounds. \u0095\tThe witness had the impression it was hair-covered, and likened the texture of the hair to that of a \u0093coconut.\u0094  The color was dark red to brown, with a lighter color in the chest area. \u0095\tIt did not look toward the highway, and he was not able to identify any facial features.\u0095\tHe felt it was not a man, and could not have been any animal he has ever seen before.\u0095\tWhile it did catch his own eye, he thought what he saw was visually subtle enough to have blended into the background vegetation where other motorists could have easily missed it.\u0095\tThe clearing was surrounded by heavy vegetation which the witness felt would provide ample concealment, but the trees in the clearing were relatively small.\u0095\tThe nearest development in the area is a rest stop a few miles to the west.\u0095\tThis witness seemed very credible in relating the details of his sighting.Of note, this report location is near the following reports:   720,   2856,   14271,   16303",
