            "Observed": "In the fall of 1994 I was hunting deer with friends north of Hotchkiss, CO. This area was called Wolf Park. I had never hunted this area before but my friend had grown up in the area. It was the September muzzleloading hunt which runs from the second to the third weekend of the month. We had drove in quite a ways. We hunted the morning and I had seen nothing.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "Two of the three witnesses were interviewed. Witness 1 is an experienced hunter and a member of the military. He said the bigfoot family was at least 600 to 800 yards away, across a draw and downslope from his position.\"The first one we saw I have to say was a male. It was the biggest of the bunch, standing out there about a quarter of the way on top of the dirt slide or old tailings. He was looking at us, which kind of caught us off guard. Then we saw another, smaller one, which I imagine was a female. It came out of the brush about 10 or 15 feet. After a few minutes, the male started moving up the hill. Then two or three young ones came up out of the draw.\"He said there was \"no question\" in his mind about what they were seeing.\"I've hunted for years and I've seen about every animal you can see. When I jumped out of the  truck I knew what I was looking at. I was ready to do a jig in the road, I was so excited.\" Soon thereafter, he said, a pickup appeared on a road below the witness and slid to a stop. He speculated that the driver would only have been able to see the male as the female and the young were downslope in the draw.\"He slammed on his brakes, stopped for about five seconds, then took off like a bat out of hell. He must have been 50 yards away and had to have seen it from about the waist up.\"The witness said when they drove down to where they saw the bigfoot family, they found large tracks on the hillside that dwarfed his size 10 foot.  \"They had to be at least a half a foot longer than mine. They were in loose dirt and they slid. I had to jump from each of his steps.\" Since publishing this report, a second witness was also interviewed. He said that he and his wife also got a chance to look at the creatures through binoculars. Witness 2 said he only saw 3 individuals, not 5. \"They were upright and their arms hung to their sides. They never went on all fours. They walked upright and were very skilled. They went down a hill - it was very very steep and made of loose shale and adobe dirt. Their tracks were slide marks. They covered that bald face probably from the top to bottom and did it at pretty good clip.\"They covered 500- 600 yards walking at a good pacethe strides were real long.\" Witness 2 said he identified two apparent adults and 1 adolescent. Because of the distance, he was unable to discern facial characteristics but clearly identified a large head and wide shoulders on an upright body.\" \"The thing is, we all agree on is what we saw. There were no trees, no obstruction of view. We were up on a high ridge overlooking this. There was nothing between us. The contrast between them and greyish brown dirt was high.\"Archery and muzzleloader season coincide in Colorado. Primitive arms hunters must wear blaze orange; archers do not. The witness said in his opinion it was highly unlikely that the three figures he saw were archers in full camoflage. \"It would have had to been three men in gorilla suits. But we didn't see anyone else up there. The only reason we were down there is we weren't finding much luck up high on deer. So went down low, in winter that's when we hunt.\" One of the most puzzling things about this report for me has been the vegetation in the sighting location. The incident occured at on a lower elevation slope where the habitat transitions to an arid, desert-like shrub and sage landscape. However, conifer and aspen forest characterize the top of the mesa above the sighting location. Witness 2 speculated that the presence of hunters at higher elevations may have caused this family group to head downslope, where they came out into the open and were spotted.\"I was a complete non believer. I thought - this is a wives tale, this thing doesn\u0092t exist. Then I was shown otherwiseI do believe it\u0092s a missing piece of the puzzle we don\u0092t have.\"",
