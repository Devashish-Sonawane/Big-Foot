            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for approximately one hour about his experience. Although he wasn\u0092t exactly certain whether his encounter took place in 1978 or 1979, he was able to recall in great detail events of his encounter.Just prior to spotting the deer, he noticed that the woods had gotten extremely quiet; there were no squirrels, birds, or any of the normal sounds that he could hear associated with being out in the woods. He told me that after spotting the deer and seeing it spook, it suddenly took three or four steps \u0093straight back, turned in a whirl, and ran away\u0094. The witness told me that he\u0092s never seen a deer ever do this before, or since that day. Immediately after this he noticed the sounds of heavy breathing which he described as \u0093real raspy, coarse breathing\u0094. He commented that the animal wasn\u0092t \u0093humped over\u0094 but that its shoulders were kind of \u0093leaned forward\u0094 and that it stood \u0093really erect\u0094 with no visible neck. Although his written report stated he was uncertain of the animal\u0092s weight, he told me that he would have estimated its weight to be in the neighborhood of 600-700 pounds.The witness said that he was close enough to the animal that he could have nearly touched it. He went on to say \u0093I could have reached out and scratched him he was so close\u0094. The witness said although he was terrified, the animal wasn\u0092t at all aggressive. He went on to say he believed that \u0093it kinda was like a curious animal just looking to see what I was doing up there\u0094. The witness said the animal was covered in a \u0093pine straw-colored hair, maybe a little darker than the orange look\u0094. When I asked him to compare it to the color of an orangutan he said it was a little bit darker than an orangutan\u0092s hair. He said the roots of the hair were darker than an orangutan\u0092s hair, but the ends were lighter than an orangutan. He commented that while the hair wasn\u0092t very thick, it was coarse. The hair length over the entire body was probably four to five inches in length except for the arms and legs, where the hair was longer. He said there was no hair around the face except for the fact that \u0093it had a mustache\u0094. He said the nose, mouth and eyes were very visible.The witness described the animal as having a dominant ridge in the eyebrows and that its eyes were \u0093set back\u0094. He described seeing what he thought were the pupils and his impression was that they were all black with no white whatsoever in the eyes. He described the pupils as having that \u0093deep coal-black look\u0094. He stated there was no similarity to a human's eye.The witness said its nose was flat, but it might have been \u0093turned up just a little bit\u0094. He said it looked more like a human nose with just a little \u0093flat\u0094 to it. He went on to describe the nose as \u0093mushed in\u0094. Although he didn\u0092t really see nostrils, only the top part, he made a comment that at the end on the nose it kind of \u0093tilted up just slightly\u0094. I asked the witness why he dropped his gun and he said he felt like he could run faster without his gun than he could with the gun. Regarding the tracks, he said they were \u0093like a human, it narrowed in the center but widened back out, but it didn\u0092t have but three toes\u0094. ",
