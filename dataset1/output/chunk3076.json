            "Observed": "I had just finished surveying some timber to be cut and was driving back to file the survey when I saw several large footprints on the side of the road. Stopping to look I found over 20 some odd tracks that went into the woods on one side up the road then crossing the road and into the woods.I also noticed alot of deer hair,no blood. Alot of deer tracks were in and around the tracks I had found.The tracks had 5 toes on each foot.They went approx 1/2 to 1inch into the gravel and sand along the road. I left and went home to get a camera, I returned with a polaroid camera and took 5 pictures because I used the rest earlier that month.The tracks were larger then my size 12 boot, I also weight about 220lbs and could not get my boot to sink as deep as the tracks.",

Thinking it might be Deer that would dart out in front of me, I slowed down a bit. As I got closer I was astonished to see that whatever it was, was about 7 feet tall with Gray hair that covered the entire body. It turned toward me and it's eyes were large and seemed to be a reddish color. The thing ranted around like it was angry or something and I floored the vehicle. I was scared to death and I immediately drove to my cousin's house to calm down and tell him what had happened. I've traveled that road alot and never saw anything like that. I had a clear shot of the thing and was fairly close. I'm not one to usually believe these stories but this IS what I saw.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness Tuesday night (Feb 25, 2003) for approximately 30 minutes along with his cousin.  Both men are curious about what was observed along Highway 92.    Further detail is listed below.The color of the figure was of a light gray like in the inside of a sweatshirt.  It was first observed approximately 70-75 yards away and was thought to be a deer.  As the driver of the vehicle got closer, he felt it was either a mailbox or some sort of equipment there.  Upon getting close enough to see detail several things stood out.  They included the reddish glow of the eyes reflecting from the lights of the vehicle.  This made the witness feel intrigued but quite frightened as well.  The size of the creature was estimated to be less than seven feet tall.  Its build was medium but athletically muscular.  No ears could be seen and its head was not as wide at the top, it seemed domed.  Hair did not seem long but it was predominant through the face and skin was not observed.  Its head seemed large for the frame.  The observer slowed to an estimated 20 mph when he drove by the creature which was approximately 20 to 30 feet off the road and only several steps from the beginning of a tree line.It made a movement with its arms at this time.  It first drew its arms up to its shoulders and then \"pressed\" them down quickly.   As the witness drove by he watched both out the window and then in the rear view mirror to see it do this exact same maneuver again.But the second time it did this it grabbed its head (around the ear area on each side of its head and appeared to shake its head and shoulders.    It then pivoted and walked into the woods.  The locomotion was described ashigh knee action in a forced deliberate but smooth movement along with swinging its arms up to near shoulder height.  The knees were described as being bent through the observation.It was like a person \"playing charades and high stepping  and showing \"swaying arms\".  The location of the observation was in an area that floods regularly during decent rains.  When the observer got home he was nervous and talked to his cousin and soon after his wife who believed he had the experience.Another second hand observation was described by his cousin and hopefully more information from this area will surface.",
