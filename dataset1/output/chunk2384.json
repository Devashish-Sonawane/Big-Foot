It was grey, 4'-5' tall, slender, fast moving, able to hide, and made a screeching noise twice, once when I think it hit something while moving and again, far away when tons of dogs were barking. Could hear stones clicking, walking and breathing nearby after I went into my tent for the night. Our peaceful camping trip turned into us being frightened.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness on the phone and can add the following details to the report:July 6, 2005\u0095 Sometime after 10 in the evening, the witness saw a grey shape dash behind a tree about 20 feet or so away. It then ran off towards the river to the right of the tree. The shape was at least 4' or 5' tall, possibly taller, since it was down a slope nearer to the river. When the animal disappeared into the brush near the river, the witness heard a thud followed by two high pitched shrieks similar to a rabbit screaming.July 7, 2005\u0095 The witness wanted to get the experience \u0093out of her head.\u0094\u0095 A \u0093stinky skunk smell\u0094 was prevalent in the area.\u0095 The witness encountered a cleaning lady in the bathroom. The cleaner asked her how she slept, to which the witness replied she had not slept well, and then related a vague, brief description of what had happened the night before. The cleaner suggested that maybe it was a baby bigfoot. The witness thought this was strange since her description of the night\u0092s events was sufficiently vague to not suggest a bigfoot.\u0095 A friend who met them at the campsite said of the river bank area that there was \u0093something wrong down there,\u0094 and that he \u0093couldn\u0092t stand it.\u0094 He left early and went home.\u0095 A stranger camped across from the family warned the witness not to leave her kids alone in the tent. This person did not give an explanation for the warning.July 8, 2005\u0095 Shortly after 10 that night, the witness\u0092s daughter spotted the animal while the family was packing. It again dashed behind a nearby tree and ran off to better cover. The woman put her kids in the tent and continued to pack their things. The witness was frightened and had her \u0093hair standing up\u0094 on her arms.\u0095 After she finished packing, the witness heard rocks banging together making a \u0093smooth clicking\u0094 sound. The clicks came in groups of three, lasted about a second or so and occurred twice.Additional comments:\u0095 Both times witnesses spotted the animal, it looked the same. It was a solid grey shape, equally massed throughout its body except for the head, which narrowed. No facial features were seen.\u0095 The witness is taking classes to pursue a degree in anthropology. She is not sure what she saw that night, but it obviously made a strong impression on her and her family.",
