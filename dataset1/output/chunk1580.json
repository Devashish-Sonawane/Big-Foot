            "Follow-Up Report": "The following few notes are based on an almost hour-long discussion with the father and several e-mails exchanged thereafter. The location of this sighting is approximately thirty miles southwest of Pueblo, Colorado in the Wet Mountains of the San Isabel National Forest and along Forest Road 400. Over the years, there have been several reports of sightings in this general area.Their attention was first caught by what would seem to be eyeshine refection but of only one eye. It was moving as they approached but remained in place half-behind the large boulder as they got near to it. The figure gradually turned to face them as they passed and it was just turning to walk back away from the road as they lost sight of it. In their estimation, it clearly was not human yet was walking on two feet and like a person, was entirely dark-colored, and was of a very large apparent height and size. After a brief stunned silence, they both immediately agreed that they had just seen a bigfoot.The following morning, just several hours later, they returned to the location but found nothing significant to report, although that is when they were certain of the size of the creature they had seen because of the size of the rock that it was standing behind. That night they saw a bear scrambling up a slope above timberline above the Blue Lakes and near Greenhorn Mountain. They remained in the area for three or four days but did notice anything else that was unusual. \"By the way, the reason I mentioned seeing the bear the next day was to assure you I know the difference between a bear and what I saw the previous morning and the bear was much farther away than the Bigfoot.\"The father concluded with the following comment: \"I wish I could have given you more definitve info in both my report and on the phone last night because I know the details I gave are sketchy at best.  Still, I am absolutely convinced of what I saw.\" The son remains reluctant to discuss the matter, although he did contribute their agreed-upon conclusion: \"Occam's Razor says that the most logical solution to a problem, or answer to a question, is the one that makes the most sense, no matter how ridiculous or absurd sounding it is.  I have always had doubts, but of all the possibilities, seeing a Bigfoot makes the most sense based on what little we have to go on.\" David Petti",

            "Observed": "It was fall of 2006 - Hunting season and I was in the woods on a farm in Ashville, FL.  I had been in the tree stand approximately 2 hours and not seen any deer.  I have been hunting most of my life and am familiar with the woods, sounds and environment.  Approximately 4:30 pm as the light was fading, I heard two loud, distinct \"cries\" or \"yells\" that I have never heard before or since.  I could tell the general direction and distance was approximately 150 -200 yds in front of me.  As I sat there looking, the wind was blowing at my back so I did not notice any unusual smell, but anything downwind from me may have smelled me.  About 10 minutes later I heard the \"yell\" again.  Possibly a bit closer ~ 125 yds.  I remember a large Oak tree about 50 - 75 yds in front of me.  There was a small sapling (8 - 10 ft tall) next to the large tree, with surrounding grasses about 2-3 ft tall.  About 10 min after the last yell I noticed the sapling being whipped back and forth.  I took special notice due to being on \"alert\" from the noise - and further the sapling was violently shaking side to side - not in a constant direction.  Almost like something grabbed the tree near the base and started to  push / pull creating a whipping effect near the top.  I looked at the tall grasses surrounding the area and they were not blowing in the same manner.  This tree appeared to be moved by something. I thought at first it may have been a squirrel that jumped on the sapling - but it shook for about 30-60 seconds - then stopped, then again for another 30 seconds.  Since I did not see anything, I sat there (somewhat in disbelief) armed with a high powered rifle. After a few minutes I was so un-easy I got down and slowly exited the woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "     I spoke with the witness to this incident by phone, and he spoke very believably as he described his experience to me. He described himself as an outdoorsman who has spent thirty to forty years in the woods hunting and camping, and, as such, is quite familiar with local animals and the sounds they make.       The yells he heard that day were unlike anything he had ever heard before - two to three seconds long, very loud, and echoing.Although the calls were closer each time he heard them, the witness believes the sounds were coming from the same animal.     He did, in fact, imitate the calls he heard for me over the phone, and they were almost identical to a recording I have of Matt Moneymaker imitating a sasquatch call on the 2009 Georgia Expedition, which I played for the witness after he did his imitation for me.  Upon hearing my recording, he told me that what he heard that day was \"almost exactly like that\". [Editor's Note - Matt Pruitt: The call that Matt Moneymaker was imitating (and that the investigator is referring to) was a whooping call.]   The combination of the loud, unidentified yells getting closer, and something shaking the sapling violently caused the witness to feel uneasy about staying in his tree stand with darkness approaching, even though he was armed with a high powered rifle.",
