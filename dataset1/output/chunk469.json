I spoke with the teacher and the student/witness on the phone. The student had a very brief sighting but is sure of the following:- It was covered in hair.- The hair color was black.- The arms hung away from the body and were almost to the knees.- Its shoulders were wide and its middle section stuck out to the sides a bit.- Its eyes were yellow when reflected in the light.- The height of 8 - 9 foot tall was determined after going back to the location and measuring the tree limbs that it stood next to.- There was an odor, similar to a sour hog.This location has since been logged, making room for housing developments.
