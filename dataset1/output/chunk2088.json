            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to both the husband and wife by phone.The husband and wife were told by their son-in-law to go hunt this area as he had bagged a big buck one week before in the vicinity. The husband saw the figure first standing next to a tree and he slowed down. The Bigfoot ran toward their vehicle, came as close as the other side of the highway, then ran away making an arc of about 125 yards. They saw it for about thirty seconds. When it was closest, it was looking directly at the wife and she saw the most details. The midday sun was shining on it. She saw; red-brown eyes, closed mouth, square yet rounded head, hair as long as eighteen inches except on face and legs, high cheek bones, brow ridge above eyes, flat chin. Shoulders three or more feet wide with a smooth taper to the waist. Long arms, and every part of it was huge including knees, elbows, forearms, but everything in proportion. She did not see breasts. Both agreed its height was eight feet or more. She saw the bottom of huge feet come out of the grass as it ran away. They were bald and brown with a tint of purple on the bottom. As it ran, the hands were in fists with the thumbs up but bent back. Both agreed it ran smoothly and fast but could have ran faster. They could see muscles ripple in the hair as it was running, so it was not someone in a ghillie suit.  It ran in the direction of the dirt road they were to turn onto and the wife told the husband not to go there. They did not think to look for tracks. The husband said if there is ever a next time, he would stop so he could see more detail. But the wife got the feeling it wanted them gone, that it was the aggressor. They have not returned to that area to hunt. She has since been nervous to camp except in a camper RV.  The witnesses did not sketch, but found two sketches that are very similar to what they saw with the following changes. On the body sketch, there should be more hair overall that is much longer. On the face sketch, there should be less hair on the face but more hair that is longer on the head. They said if those changes were made to the sketches, and combine them, that is what they saw.  ",

            "Observed": "Observed a giant bi-pedal creature in the Cherokee National Forest in Unicoi County Tennessee near the North Carolina border. Creature was in the creek when I first saw it. The creature immediately sensed my presence and came out of the creek and placed its hand on a tree and hit the tree in a knocking manner approximately 4 times. I was trying to get my phone out and attempt to take a picture when the creature stomped the ground with its foot and growled something incredibly fierce several times. A growl I can best describe as a mix between a bear and a large canine. After the growl I started to retreat and as I did the creature took off in a run and vanished. I was in the very close range of 15 to 20 yards when I observed it. If there had not been running water I don't believe I would have gotten that close to it as it masked it hearing me and me hearing it. The time of day was 7 am and I was in the woods going to go trout fishing. I watched the creature for around 45 seconds and height estimate is at least 8feet and shoulder to shoulder 3 feet at least. The creature had brown and red hair that was very thick, yet had a shine in the coat, a flat face and a distinct, almost white nose that looked very wide and brown eyes. I am very fortunate to see what I saw and all the details of the creature as I was very close to it I am a believer in sasquatches and just feel so fortunate to have this experience. I didn't feel threatened by the creature just in awe of its massive size and agility as it lept out of the creek and how quickly it ran out of sight.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness on 3 occasions and find him to be a credible witness.At first sight the Bigfoot was in creek water up to its knees, they made eye contact with each other.It leaped with amazing agility out of the water and onto the bank.Next, the Bigfoot stomped its foot to the ground. The BF looked at the witness and gave what was described as a moan growl scream.The witness then saw and heard the Bigfoot step toward and strike a tree four times with its hand. It then immediately ran toward and into the thick forest.The hair at the head and shoulder was a lighter tint of reddish brown; the rest of the body was darker.",
