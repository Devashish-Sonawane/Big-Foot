            "Observed": "On the 19th of May 2007 at around 8:30 AM, My Wife and I were on our way to the local bait shop on the Flagler/Volusia county line in central Florida. Our usual route to this shop at Highbridge Rd. is via Old Dixie Hwy through Walter Boardman also known as \"the loop\". I was turning left off Old Dixie onto Walter Boardman and I looked ahead on the road and saw 2 vehicles approx. 1/2 mile in front of me on Walter Boardman. At that instant behind the vehicle  closest to me I saw a tall, dark figure on 2 legs swiftly cross the road from south to north. The figure that I saw was taller than the vehicle ahead of it and it appeared to cross the road in 3 or 4 stiff-legged strides. I said to my Wife \"did you see that\"? She replied that she had not as she was looking for something in her purse, by that time it was already in the woods. I sped up to reach the area where the figure crossed the road, my Wife and I scanned the woods where it had disappeared and saw no trace of it. I knew right away that this was not a regular animal or man because it was extremely tall, dark and fast, although it did not appear to be running, the strides covered a great distance.We continued towards our destination and arrived at Bulow Plantation Ruins, a state park where we fish. We mentioned what I had seen to the Ranger who dismissed it as a black bear. I disagree, it was lean and too fast to be a bear walking on hind legs. I wish that I could have gotten a better look up close but I have and will continue to look carefully as I drive \"the loop\" for another sighting of this very interesting creature.",

The figure was approximately two to three feet taller than the truck and walked on two legs so he estimated the height to be 7 - 9 feet tall. He has lived in areas such as Alaska and is very familiar with seeing bears, he firmly states that it was not a bear.  The witness has visited this location several times to look for evidence with no success.Bulow Plantation Ruins State Park is 150 acres through which Bulow creek travels before it empties into the Tomoka Basin. The park is part of a \"greenway\" corridor that connects to the nearby North Peninsula Recreation area on the coast. ",
