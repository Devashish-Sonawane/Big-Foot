            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness (boyfriend in the background) for about an hour. The conversation started out by recounting the history of occurrences around their home over the previous few years. They stated that there were numerous times that they heard a variety of vocalizations, everything from screams to howls. On one occasion they heard what they described as talking (but not understanding the words) from behind their garage. When her boyfriend and son went outside to try to record the sounds they quit. She told me of another time they heard something hit their door. They went outdoors and found a branch from a poplar tree about three feet long. Two odd things about this is that they do not have any poplars in the immediate area, and the branch had not been broken off but appeared to have been twisted off. They stated that there were many other things that happened over a couple year span that they couldn't explain. As well as the behavior of their dog at times. She then told me of the morning they had a sighting as they were leaving their home. She and her boyfriend were in the car and were pulling out of there driveway on to a dirt road to head to town. The morning was overcast and slightly foggy. As they got to the end of their drive her boyfriend asked her if the coast was clear. That is when she seen what she described as a tall, black, hair covered, upright creature walking on two legs heading down the road to their right away from them. When they first noticed it it was around 35 - 40 yards away from them and they both watched it walk away. As it did so it would walk down into the ditch then back up on to the road and then into the ditch again as it continued into the woods and out of sight. They said that they watched it until it was about a hundred or so yards away. They could not believe what they had just seen. They called her son who came out there with a friend. They were able to find a number of footprints where what they seen had walked down the road. The friend of her son had taken a picture of the best track which clearly showed five toes. The track was estimated at around 16.5 - 17 inches long. They estimated the height of the creature at around 7 - 7.5 feet tall. At no time did they see the face as it did not turn around. But they are convinced it knew they were there and was just trying to get away as quickly as possible in a steady stride. They have told me they would try to get a copy of the photo of the track, will update this report when I receive it.They live just outside the very vast Chippewa National Forest.",

            "Observed": "Three friends enjoying an all day ride up to the snow in Whiskeytown National Park. We were all on horseback. We spotted what appeared to be Bigfoot tracks in the snow. We got off our horses for close examination and could clearly see the toes in the snow. Two of the witnesses are RN's. I am an Appraiser. What made this sighting of tracks credible to me were the existence of so many other tracks, including bear, that gave good comparison to other critters and size.  The tracks came up out from the gulch, followed the road a bit, then back down into the gulch. Also my friend noticed smaller Bigfoot tracks coming down from a very steep draw on the left of the road. There were no tracks going up, just coming down, as if to \"join\" the others. It was still very cold when we first saw these tracks, but they were melting when we rode back through this area many hours later.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone in late January. We discussed a variety of encounters she has experienced or heard about from a lifetime of inquiry into the bigfoot subject. She stated that she is very aware of her surroundings when out in the woods and regularly examines all of the animal tracks they see while riding.  The discovery on January 7, 2013 of bigfoot prints was a result of this practice.I can add the following details about the tracks seen and photographed on January 7th:- There were three different sizes of bare foot tracks in the snow. They ranged in size from 17 inches to a very small track only 8 to 10 inches long. (note: tracks were found after the snow melted and refroze. This can be seen in the photos.)- The trackway originated from a gully on the right side of the road and continued along the berm for approximately \u00bc mile and then went back downhill into the ravine. Other tracks were seen on this road during a November 2012 ride. These photographs provide good images of what was seen and we are thankful for the effort to document evidence. They also serve as a reminder to other enthusiasts to use a scale item when photographing possible evidence. (A dollar bill, a quarter, your driver's licence, etc. Any item of a known size - and not your shoe or boot.) Single track from directly above. Witness estimated the length at 17 inches.Boot next to prints in snow.View of general scene from January 7th ride along snowy road.",
