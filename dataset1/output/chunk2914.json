Hearing the sounds i distinctively remember from the sound recordings and this one was similar to the low, far away moan type sounds on the recording.

The sound only continued for about another minute and as soon as it silenced, all the dogs in the neighborhood, even coyotes in the distance, all at once began to bark and howl. I decided to stay inside that night and the next morning went to the tree line on top of the river to see or hear anything else, but nothing more than.",
