            "Observed": "I was traveling home from work in Gallup to Bluewater, South Side.  The time was about 8 p.m.  As I was traveling on hiway 612, right when I was exiting the sharp curves, I noticed a figure moving by the road on the right side.  I thought it was a very tall person at first but when I looked I noticed that it wasn't human.  As I got closer it started to cross the road and almost hit my truck.  It stopped and I did not want to stop because the road was ice packed and I didn't want to get stuck or run off the road.  I seen the creature a few feet thru my trucks passenger front window.  The creature's face looked ape and humanistic.  He was probably 7 feet tall because when he got real close to the vehicle I couldn't see his face.  He stood way over the truck. I was overwhelmed with fear at this point and just kept going home.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness was interviewed by phone on April 14, 2011.At the time of the incident there was approximately two to three inches of snow on the road and it was snowing lightly. As the witness rounded a right-hand corner, he noticed an individual walking south along the right shoulder of the highway, approximately 100 yards ahead. His initial thought was to give this \u0093person\u0094 a ride and he was trying to figure out how he could get going again since his truck is two-wheel drive and the road climbs steadily at this point. Slowing down as he approached the subject, he was struck with the enormous size as well as the fact that this was unlike anything he had ever seen. The creature turned to its left when the witness was almost to it, giving him a clear view of it in the headlights. Details of the creature:\u0095\tSeven to eight feet tall, at least 400 pounds.\u0095\tCovered in long \u0093mop like\u0094, brown hair over the body with shorter, grayish (possibly due to snow) hair on the head.\u0095\tLong arms which swung as it walked.\u0095\tHuge legs.\u0095\tMassive chest and shoulders.\u0095\tDark eyes.\u0095\tGray/brown skin on the face, with not much facial hair. Pronounced brow ridge.\u0095\tLooked like an \u0093old man\u0094 or \u0093old warrior\u0094 with an angry expression.\u0095\tDid not notice the hands or feet.The creature looked directly at the witness as he neared. Passing within five feet, the witness could see the creature\u0092s chest through the passenger window of his truck. As stated in the report, he was very scared at this point and was worried about spinning out on the slick road. He did not see where the creature went after driving past it.The witness and his wife returned to the location the following morning to look for footprints. Since the snow was already melted they were unable to locate any. However, there was a loud crashing noise in the trees on a hillside to the east of their location that he believes could have been caused by a large rock being thrown. At this point he decided it was best to leave the area.Driving this route daily for the past two years, the witness is very familiar with the typical wildlife present in the area, which includes a large number of deer and elk. He had noticed in the months preceding his encounter that these animals were not to be seen. There are numerous water sources in the immediate area, which is located at an approximate elevation of 7,200\u0092 in a forested area. ",

I was in the woods playing explorer with three other kids. All of a sudden, it got very quiet in the woods. We also got very quiet, but continued to walk through the woods. I was in front and we were walking single-file. We were following a deer trace. It went around a large tree in the distance. I started to smell something very malodorous. I rounded the tree and I almost ran into it. It was a huge, hairy creature, very smelly, over six feet in height and dark brown in color. It was NOT a bear. It had an almost human face. The creature spun around and I screamed at the other kids to go back, now, as fast as they could. We ran back to the parking lot of the lake as fast as we could.",
