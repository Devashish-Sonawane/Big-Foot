            "Follow-Up Report": "An unimpressive sighting report on the one hand but themore background one has on this report and the witness, the more amusing it becomes.  Miles B. was a student in my science class three years ago and received a basic treatment of the bigfoot enigma as part of a classroom presentation on scientific mysteries.  As with most students, Miles doubted that such creatures could still exist and he felt that the evidence that had been presented was not compelling.Then, on a recent summer night Miles was out with friends making mischief in the rural fringe of Portland. Their rural road sign stealing escapades were cut short by a terrifying series of events that occurred at very close range. Miles visited me at work soon after to inform me of the details and to offer that they returned to the site several time since and have not seen or heard anything significant (as I would expect).  He also informs me that although he laughed at the concept of bigfoot when we discussed the possibility in class years ago, he now has a very different outlook on the matter.Gordon Creek Rd. between Corbett and Aims, Ore. is an area with many past bigfoot sightings, particularly in late summer. Gordon Creek Rd. traverses heavily forested creek drainages in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains on the western slopes of Mt. Hood.This amusing event may suggests that bigfoots are clever enough to perceive the mischievous intentions of a teenaged male and then to display a sense of humor in the way it dispatched the larceny-minded teen.  If this is too much anthropomorphizing of the sasquatch, it is still gratifying to know that at least one sasquatch used its considerable powers of intimidation to protect the public's expenditure of tax dollars on rural highway signs. Even more amusing is the fact that Miles, the typical jaded American teenager, has a newfound respect for mysterious nocturnal creatures as a result of having the daylights scared out of him in a manner that he never thought possible. Miles, for one, does not laugh at the possibility of bigfoots any more.",

It was then that he smelled the awful odor. He saw nothing looking from side to side but upon looking behind him, toward where the mountain began and the cornfield ended, he saw the animal standing motionless and silent, blending in with the surroundings. \u0095 The witness described its head as large, oval shaped, with 4 to 5 inch dark brown hair all over its body. He saw no neck and described its head as sitting down on its shoulders. Its eyes were large, and round. Its hands were huge and he clearly saw four fingers and a thumb. Its shoulders were approximately 3 feet wide and slightly hunched over. He estimates its weight at between 400 and 450lbs. He saw no discernable waist as the animal was blocky in shape.  \u0095 The witness and the animal stared at each other for approximately 30 seconds before the witness bolted, running into a barbwire fence, tearing his clothing.  \u0095 He never heard the animal\u0092s approach. He speculated that it might have been in the area he ran into, or that it had been pacing him, as earlier he felt like he was being watched. \u0095 For years the question that has haunted him the most was the animal\u0092s intent. He doesn\u0092t believe its intention was to hurt him. He believes he was in its territory and the expression he saw on its face was one of curiosity and concern, as if it was trying to figure out what he was doing there.  \u0095 The witness said he\u0092s kept his silence all these years because he was a long haired, 20 year old at the time of his sighting, and he thought people would not believe him. Now, as a grandfather, he wants his grandchildren to know about this event. \u0095 The witness had nightmares about the animal for years and despite the passing of 32 years, his memory of the animal and the event, is crystal clear, saying, \u0093I just know what I saw.\u0094A news article, 'Bigfoot in Wilkes?', hit his local paper Wednesday, July 21, 2010, a month after his daughter helped him file this report. This witness initially called us because he does not have a computer.  The first sketch was created with the help of the witness. The second was created with the help of artwork submitted by his brother.",
