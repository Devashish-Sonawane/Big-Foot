            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to both witnesses on 9/10/08.  The following details can be added to the report:-The witnesses were traveling westward on Hwy 26, just east of Rhododendron, coming back from a fishing trip.-A jeep was stopped to the side of the opposite lane up ahead.-The witness in the passenger seat saw movement on the road.  He commented to the driver that the jeep must have just hit an animal, so he should slow the car down.-The witness' vehicle was traveling about 5 to 10 miles per hour, and was very close to the creature when it jumped onto the road, possibly as close as 10 feet, to run behind their car.  -The creature ran from the north side of the road to the south.-The car in front of them stopped, and the car behind them took evasive action to avoid hitting the animal as it ran behind the witnesses.  -The creature quickly changed its direction to avoid being hit by the car behind the witnesses. Its movements were \u0093inhuman\u0094 and had an \u0093animal's quickness\u0094.  -The driving witness commented to the passenger, \u0093That was an ape!\u0094-As the creature ran across the road, several of the witnesses in the other cars blew their horns, including the reporting witnesses. -The creature is described as having light brown hair (\u0093like a brown bear\u0094), very long arms, a stooping gait, and a thick build \u0093like a linebacker\u0094.  -It's face was seen by the driver as it sprang from the woods.  It had a wide-eyed expression on its face that the witness interpreted as fear and panic.  Its mouth was \u0093tight-lipped\u0094, and no teeth were visible.  The face was described as being human-like and light brown colored.  The witness compared the face to an orangutan's face, but again, very human-like.-The creature sprang from the woods on two legs, but it had a forward-leaning gait that left its hands barely off the ground.  -It galloped quadrupedally across the road by putting its right arm forward with its left leg forward, and alternating in this pattern.  It's back legs moved like a man running whether it was on all fours or running bipedally.  -When on all fours it ran on its knuckles, not on an open hand.",
