We were on  WA- 104 NE and came up to the Center Loop mid-point to get on Center Rd to head to the camp site. We made a right turn on to Center Rd but it curves south under highway and driving for just a few minutes and coming out of a long curve to a long straightway, approaching mile marker (#3) moments passing side road called Dabob Road, a rock no bigger than a small apple came flying out of the tree line and hit my truck on the top of the hood near the passenger windshield wiper. I wanted to stop and get out investigate but my girlfriend was a bit nervous about stopping and did not want to stop.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to both witnesses by phone: He was focused on driving so did not see the figure but he saw the rock flying from the tree line and hit the truck. He noted they were not seeing other cars on the road. His girlfriend saw a dark brown to black figure for about three seconds, twenty to thirty feet from the road at the tree line. It was in a crouched or squatting position like a baseball catcher. It was about four feet high with shoulders about three feet wide. She did not see ears or neck. She described it as big and bulky and was adamant it was not a bear sitting there nor a person. It was all dark, including the face and it seemed to have hair over the face. She did not see it move but then her focus went to seeing the rock come from the tree line. He almost came to a stop but she had a strange feeling come over her and did not want to stop. I had her look at sketches in The Bigfoot Sketch Project found on the BFRO homepage. When she saw the Bob Snyder body sketch (which is standing), she said that is what the chest, shoulders, face and head looked like. Because it was squatting, she could not see below the chest. If she would have seen the figure move, this could be a Class A report. I have been on BFRO expeditions with this couple and their credibility and observational skills are not to be questioned.Weather check for nearby Seattle, Washington on this date: Mostly cloudy, visibility 10 miles, zero precipitation, wind from S.W. at 5mph, no wind gusts. Sunset 8:13pm. ",
