We had set up camp in an area known as Lonesome Woods which covers about three counties. It was really cold and we had a really big fire going and we were all sitting around it to stay warm, when all of a sudden this weird moaning sound filled the woods. It sounded kind of like a siren except it was very loud. It let off a series of three moans starting low building and then dropping, pitch as well as volume, in three bursts.",

I cocked the hammer back on the .32 caliber carbine, shouldered the weapon, and began to press the trigger.  Something in my mind ordered me to not shoot the creature!  I call it Devine intervention.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After talking with this witness by phone on the 12th of September, 2008, the witness, \u0093R.R.R.,\u0094 answered most of the questions in his report, and so after 44 years, only a little more can be added to this report. The Observation section of this report was updated by the witness, and that took place before we talked.The creature was about 50 yards away from the witness, and it was between him and the sun as it was rising.  He said that it was a dark bodied thing, as it walked upright out of the thick patch of bushes and stood looking, for a moment, up and down the firebreak. He watched it as it walked across a fire cut which was below him, and down a mountain ridge that he was facing. The creature took two strides to cross that clearing. The firebreak was about 20 feet across.This animal also observed this witness, because R.R.R. spoke out loud when he first seen the creature enter into the firebreak. The creature then stopped, turned and looked at him, and then turned and continued to cross the firebreak. The creature then stopped just inside the brush on the other side, because the witness could see its dark form in the brush, and it began to watch this young man for approximately one minute. Then it went crashing off down the mountain, because the witness could hear it moving through the trees and brush; pushing them to one side or the other as it continued on down the mountain.What would you estimate its weight to have been?  \u0093I believe somewhere between 500 to 700 lbs.\u0094Did you see any facial and body features? \u0093Yes\u0094, as described above in the witness\u0092 report.Did you notice the arms and/or hands? \"Yes, the arms were long and the hands looked like ours, but the palms of those hands were light brown in color.\"Describe the smell. \u0093It was a very strong, wet animal smell, something much stronger and raunchier than a wet dog.\u0094Did you ever measure those two human looking tracks in the dirt? \u0093Never measured, but estimated them in the range of 16 to 17 inches long and real wide, much wider than my size nine boots. One of the tracks indicated that it had five toes, which were very clear.\u0094This witness was very credible and believable in the retelling of his encounter, and I do believe that he saw a Sasquatch while deer hunting on that mountain during the early morning hours. Please, be advised, that most folks wouldn\u0092t have had the courage to check out where an animal like this had just disappeared into the bush.Update: I just received an e-mail message from this witness on the 6th of October 2008, stating that he just finished reading a new Bigfoot book, 'The Hoopa Project'.  The following was his statement to me: \"I have found what I think is the best representative sketch of the creature I saw back in 1964 = Romeo's sketch, page 206!  It is pretty darn close to what I remember seeing so long ago, anyway.  R.R.R.\"This could be considered fairly conclusive information/evidence on what was seen by this witness during his sighting in Ventura County, California back in 1964.",
