I was fishing and I heard what was two bigfoots fighting and when i shined my spotlight across the creek, two large brown hairy looking caveman looking things ran swiftly up the hill and i reeled in my poles and got the hell out of there. I'm not going back there at all by myself again.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After interviewing the witness, I believe him to be truthful with his accounts. The sighting took place in an area that is very isolated with no houses or roads.  There are more than 600 square miles of forest with very few roads and almost no homes from the sighting location, westward.  The witness had to hike to his fishing spot. The creek where the sighting took place is actually a long, narrow, winding man-made lake about 200 yards wide. He had been fishing in the dark for about 15 minutes when the fighting sounds started. For about 30 minutes, the two animals were running left and right about 60 yards each way as they worked their way down hill towards the witness. The sound of tree limbs being ran through and broken was accompanied with growling and hollering.  The two would stop frequently and to the witness it sounded as if they were fighting each other.  Being a mature, lifelong outdoorsman, he could tell there was no way it could be deer or humans fighting. When he could tell they were in a clearing near the waterline across from his location, he illuminated them with a powerful spot light.  The light illuminated the left side of two 7\u0092-7.5\" tall bipeds facing the same direction (90 degrees to the witness).  They had dark skin.  Their shoulders were very wide and both had large buttocks and hands.  They were very lean and muscles could be seen in action.  Both turned and sprinted away, straight uphill as fast as deer, quickly into the forest where he could still hear them running away.  Neither of the two looked at his spotlight.",
