            "Observed": "It was February 25th 12:50am up at our family cabin which is located between the Ottawa National and Nicolet National Forest.  The Cabin is on a deadend street, a few roads off of an entrance to a lake.  I had woken up to go to to the bathroom an had to go really bad but the bathroom was being used so I went outside the cabin to go to the bathroom outside.  When I stepped outside I could hear a few dogs down one of the main streets barking frantically.  I took a few steps outside from our side door to go to the bathroom.  I heard a very loud knock (50-100yds) to my left (NW) towards the dead end side of the road.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Ben regarding his experience.The cabin, which is more like a house as he described it, is located on a dead end road in the Nicolet National Forest.  To the north of the cabin are dense, thick woods and the Ottawa National Forest. And to the east lies Lac Vieux Desert, a large lake on the Wisconsin-Michigan border.He woke up around 12:50 am to use the bathroom, but the light was on and the door was shut so he put on his coat and boots and headed outside.  To the west and north he could distinctly hear dogs frantically barking, which is unusual because normally its a very quiet area at night.  As he finished he had the distinct sense of being watched from the woods - the sense that something was terribly wrong.  The hair on his neck stood on end.  Ben started to make his way back to the house when he heard a very loud, indescribable huge wood knock noise he estimated to be within eighty to one hundred yards.  It was a sound he had never heard before, and he froze in his tracks. Totally creeped out Ben hurriedly made his way back to the house.  Since then he's tried to replicate the wood knock, but hasn't been successful.Since the February 2012 wood knock Ben explored more of the woods around the cabin, and about fifty yards to the northwest of it he found two mounds of sticks, one in front of the other, and each about three feet in height.  His neighbors have also reported hearing various sounds in the woods including knocks.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a population of 21,033, and a total area of 1,018 square miles (2,640 km2), of which 874 square miles (2,260 km2) is land and 144 square miles (370 km2) (14.16%) is water. There are 1,318 lakes in the county. Much of Vilas County is covered by the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest and the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest as well as extensive county forest lands. Vilas County waters drain to Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and the Mississippi River. The Wisconsin, Flambeau, and Presque Isle Rivers all find their headwaters in Vilas County. The economy in Vilas County is based on tourism centered on its high concentration of lakes and forests. ",

Just thinking about it now makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.''In addition to measuring it against a chain link fence, he said the animal's head stuck well above the bottom of a sign that was eight feet off the ground. \"This thing was just awfully tall. I mean it was thick, but it was tall. I'll never forget the way it walked -- very graceful. That's what really spooked me the most. I played basketball with a tall kid in high school. He was 6' 11'' and he was about as graceful as a bull in a china shop. He had big feet and whenever he ran down the court, you could hear him going, clump clump clump.''The witness said he saw eye sockets and a nose, but few other facial features. He said he could see its hands and feet, including bare palms and individual fingers.\"I could see its hands. It was swinging, arms like you'd be if you were walking along very fast -- not quite like power walking, but fast. Both hands were open. I distinctly remember seeing his hands and feet. When he turned the corner I could distinctly see a heel, like a man's foot.''",
