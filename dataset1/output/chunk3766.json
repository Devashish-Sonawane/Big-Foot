The vocalization was followed by at least one and possibly two response calls. The response calls were of a warbling or yodeling nature. At 01:40 MDT, I heard two strings of high velocity rifle fire from the same direction as the response calls. The area was searched and spotlighted to a distance of 2 Km north and south of our campsite without results.",
