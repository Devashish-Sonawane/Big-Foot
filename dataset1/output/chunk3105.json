            "Follow-Up Report": "There were five people present during the incident. There were two eyewitnesses. The temperature was near freezing. There was partial moonlight with a few clouds. The terrain is desert with ravines, with mountains visible in the distance.The two witnesses were a 14 year old and his 18 year old cousin. They were camping with his mother, Grandmother, and a family friend, and two small children. Investigator Craig Woolheater talked to the 14 year old and his mother on two different occasions. The 14 year old said he went outside the camper to get some soft drinks from the car. As he approached the car he saw a black, large figure walking on two legs through a ravine. The figure appeared humanoid. He could not make out any facial features or any other details. He said he thought the figure had to be around 8' ft. tall, because the shallow ravine the creature was walking in was 10 ft. deep. After the sighting, his cousin brought a flashlight and walked back out with him. The tall figure wasn't in sight. After a few minutes, a long, loud growl was heard, along with a digging sound. The boy said the \"digging\" sounded like what a bull/buck would do with his hoof against the ground when angered. The growl seemed both angry and intimidating.--------------------------------Arrangements are being made for these witnesses meet with the attendees of the upcoming New Mexico BFRO expedition in late December 2004. One of the areas targetted by the December expedition is not far from where this incident occurred. A small team from the expedition group will go to this site and look around for tracks, and a possible travel route to other areas where sightings have occurred.---------------------------------If you are a hiker and photographer, you might thoroughly enjoy helping the BFRO investigate this region for tracks, etc., as part of the BFRO expedition in December. If you are interested, please contact the expedition organizer. See expedition links on the BFRO homepage for contact info.",

            "Observed": "My brother, dad and I had spent the day hunting behind our home. A ravine ran through the deep woods where we were fox hunting. The pelts brought a good price in those days. I was about 11 years old. While we hunted I had noticed large tracks in the snow. I tried to report it to dad but he was a very intense hunter and ignored me. As my brother and I drove the ravine I had this strange feeling of being watched. We had no luck that day and headed back home. We usually unloaded our rifles in the back yard before going inside. It was at this time that my brother yelled, \"look.\" He was pointing to the back of the pasture behind the house. I saw something that I cannot explain. At first we thought we were looking at a bear lumbering on all fours but then it stood up. It was very tall and it was covered in a brownish fur. The fur on its arms was rather long. I could see the fur hanging from its arms as it reached out to touch the pasture fence in a posture more like a man. Then it stepped over a five foot fence and walked off into the heavy thicket completely out of sight. The pasture was owned by Jay Baker who is now deceased. My brother always called this the, \"Freak of Nature Bear.\" I have never seen anything like this since. There was a creek that ran through the part of the pasture where the creature was sighted. This was also where I first had spotted the tracks. I have told this story many times since to various friends.",
