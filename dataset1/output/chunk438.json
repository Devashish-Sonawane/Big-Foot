When asked if she thought it could possibly be an owl or another animal she recounted that the depth and strength of the sounds that carried over such a long distance had to be made from a very large chested animal. With her experience as a Large Animal Technician it is reasonable to believe that it was not from livestock. Also, there do not seem to be any farms in the direction she described hearing the sounds. The habitat in the area she described the sounds coming from includes a pond and river to the south and could plausibly provide food and cover for a large animal. The BFRO database has numerous published and non-published Pierce County reports. ",
