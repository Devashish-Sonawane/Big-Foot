There had been sightings of sasquatch near our home, and at that time my husband and I laughed about that never taking them seriously.  I lived at Scenic about 10 years and enjoyed taking walks by myself with my samoyed dog. That dog would chase bears away, running them up trees. I always felt safe with her around.  One morning, the dog went with my husband to work and I decided to take a walk down to the end of the road towards highway 2. It was a beautiful spring day and the snow still lay in places on the ground.  I can still see and hear this like it was yesterday.",

My husband and I were looking up towards the mountain wondering what was going on. I said to him what the heck is going on up there?

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have known Judy Walters Donnally all my life. Interviewing her near her Spokane home was a pleasure. I used to spend two weeks with the Walter family in the summer months being the same age as her children. Our two families spent a good deal of time riding our horses in the mountains around Scenic with Don or Judy acting as trail guides. My time with Judy, Don and family was always an educational experience of how to live in the high mountains. Judy's knowledge of the mountains, local history, foods to eat, what not to eat, the different animals and their behaviors were lessons I still hold to and practice today when in the mountains. Judy's husband, Don Walters worked as switch and maintenance man on the Burlington Northern Railroad during the years recounted above.She had recounted this story to me in Pullman, Washington during the summer of 1987 and I again interviewed her in person, June of 2001 in Spokane.  Her experience is still very impressive and quite compelling.",
