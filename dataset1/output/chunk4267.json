The woman said she got within about 70 feet before the creature saw her and disappeared into the woods. \"Her story sounds pretty credible,\" Everett said.  Last October, a man named Tim Ford from Redding, California was camping with family and friends in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest when he reportedly spotted a Bigfoot. His sighting attracted statewide attention when he reported it to the Department of Fish and Game.",

            "Observed.1  ": "Carter's ski tracks indicated that he had raced down the mountain, as one searcher described it in a story in the Oregon Journal. \"taking chances that no skier of his calibre would take unless something was terribly wrong or he was being pursued.\"  The speaker was Bob Lee, a Portland Mountaineer, who is a member of the exclusive international Alpine Club and who has led and advised U.S. expeditions to the Himalayas. In his wild descent, Carter jumped several gaping crevices before going right off a steep canyon wall.  Neither he nor his equipment was ever found. Several of the seventy-five men in the search parties reported they experienced an uncomfortable feeling of being watched the whole time they were in the area.  Lee said, \"It was the most eerie experience I've ever had.  I could feel the hair on my neck standing up... I was unarmed except for my ice axe and, believe me, I never let go of that.\" Lee said that both he and Dr. Otto Trott, the surgeon for the Seattle Mountain Rescue Council, came to the same conclusion:  \"The apes got him.\"  ",
