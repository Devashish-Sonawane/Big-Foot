The following details can be added to his report:\u0095  The witness and his girlfriend lived in Lamont, CA at the time.\u0095  The weather was cold and wet, and the ground was very muddy.\u0095  The creature moved from left to right across the road.\u0095  The creature was described as being between 6 and 7 feet tall, covered in long black hair, with very long arms and a large head.  \u0095  The headlights of the car illuminated to about its shoulders.\u0095  The creature had a slouched posture with no apparent neck, much like a \u0093lineman on a football team\u0094.\u0095  The creature\u0092s walk was peculiar.  Its legs were bent, and it took very long strides.  It moved at about jogging speed for a human, and moved \u0093smoothly\u0094 across the road in about four or five steps.\u0095  When the witness first saw the creature, it was about 100 feet away.  At its closest, they were only 20 or 25 feet apart.\u0095  The witness thought it might be a person in need of help due to a broken down car or something, but as he approached the creature he saw this was not true.  \u0095  The creature was obviously not human due to the thickness of its arms and thighs, the length of its arms, its sheer mass, and its strange gait.\u0095  The witness was a highway patrolman for 15 years, and is now a junior high school teacher.Lamont is near the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains.  Bigfoot researchers in the 1970's used to mention reports from this region. They mentioned various places in southern and central California with a similar geographic pattern --  orchards and vineyards at the base of mountain ranges.  It was thought the bigfoots would come out of the mountains on occassion to feed in the orchards and vineyards at night.",
