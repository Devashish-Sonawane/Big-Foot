When they startled it on the road, it sprinted and covered nearly 60 to 70 yards very quickly. He said while the creature looked similar in nature to the bigfoot in the Patterson footage, this one moved significantly faster toward the woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with this witness, he has had three different incidents...a sighting, footprints and vocals. All in different locations in the area.  Evening sighting:  While he was driving home around 9:30 pm from his father-in-law's house, traveling on County Road 1, he was approximately 21 miles from the city of Rice when his headlights caught a figure crossing the road ahead.  His lights illuminated a bipedal figure up to its knees.  He stated it had long, black matted hair. He could clearly see the calves and large feet of the figure because of the lights.  The upper torso was more shadowed but he could make out a large, human-like torso approximately 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall, long arms that almost touched its knees, which swung as it walked.  He estimated the figure to be about 3 feet wide, 500 pounds. The figure only needed 4 steps to cross the two-lane highway.  On the phone, he stated that it was traveling from the east to the west from a heavily wooded area, towards the river. The Mississippi River area has a high concentration of catfish, turtles and frogs. He also stated that the area has numerous wildlife, including a healthy population of deer, due to the corn fields in the area.  The terrain is hilly, forested, no caves to his knowledge, Mississippi River on one side, but there are also numerous abandoned farm buildings in the area.    Footprint:  While he was grouse hunting near Onamia, MN (2017) at a wildlife management area, about 35 miles from Rice, he found two footprints.  One on a hard packed trail, barely visible.  He found a second print, about 42 inches away from the first, in the soft sand.  He photographed the print:He stated it was 15 inches long by 6 inches wide.  Toes are visible.  It was approximately 3/4 inches deep. We believe these prints could have been made by a bear. Vocals:  He has heard vocals by his home which is located in a very remote location.  He has heard numerous howls, growls, knocks, and even chatter.  This has happened every couple of weeks for a year.  Thick forest is only about 45 yards from his patio.  His apartment is near Rice.This witnesses seemed very truthful, excited and very believable when I spoke with him.",
