            "Observed": "About 2001, I was up on Mt. Loop Hwy with my best friend.  We decided to go for a late afternoon hike that we were familiar with, Heather Lake Trail.  In fact, that was our routine exercise spot because we knew it was safe.  Before I explain that incident, there is something else I need to share...we went up there on another occasion and noticed a really LARGE kind of hut off the trail.  It was somewhat difficult to get to due to the steep terrain.  I can't even recall how we even noticed it because it was so well-disguised.  It was enormous, though.  We made it down there and explored it:  heavy amount of broken branches covered over a hollowed out tree stump, roof made of fresh branches, tons of more branches on the floor that appeared to be matted as if it was slept on, entrance was covered by more branches.  I'm 5-03\" and it was high enough to be a 2-story home for a kid's playhouse... about 7ft high.  It was amazing, but very eerie because it was obvious that it was recently built and used.  Also, there was a stinky odor (wet dog).  Within a few minutes, Cyndi and I felt like we were being watched and left the hut right away to continue our hike.  We thought nothing of it after that- didn't suspect a bigfoot at all because that didn't cross our mind.",

I found her to be very credible as she related what happened to her and her friend on the trail back in 2001.  The two women felt very afraid as they ran down the trail during the rest of the encounter.Her description of events strongly indicate to me that she and her best friend were being watched and then followed back down the trail by a sasquatch.Photo taken at Heather Lake:The trail head to Heather Lake is located on the road to Mount Pilchuck, which is along the Mountain Loop Highway East of the town of Granite Falls, Washington. The Mountain Loop Highway has a long history of Bigfoot activity, including the following reports:Report # 37101.Report # 26353.Report # 25882.Report # 23170.Report # 23017.Report # 16276.Report # 1880.Report # 1722.Report # 1672.I couldn't find a video of the couple's encounter that she remembered and referred to, so I'm not sure if all the details are correct. If anyone can provide a link it would be appreciated. Snow on the mountain is getting in the way of further investigation of the \"hut\".  The Mountain Loop Highway is a highway in the U.S. state of Washington. It traverses the western section of the Cascade Range within Snohomish County. The name suggests it forms a full loop, but it only is a small portion of a loop, which is completed using State Routes 92, 9, and 530. Part of the highway is also a designated and signed Forest Highway, and is known as Forest Route 20.The highway connects the towns of Granite Falls and Darrington. It is paved for 34 miles (55 km) from Granite Falls to Barlow Pass (2349') where the highway becomes unpaved for 13 miles (21 km), and then paved again for the remaining 9 miles (14 km) to Darrington. The unpaved section is U.S. Forest Service Road #20 and passes several USFS campgrounds. Portions of the unpaved section are often closed for periods of several years due to flood damage.",
