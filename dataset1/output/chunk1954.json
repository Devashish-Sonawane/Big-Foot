            "Observed": "On approximately April 22,14 I was at Fools Hollow Lake near Showlow, AZ I was out on the lake around the bend fishing where a storm was starting to roll in from the east as the storm was getting closer I was becoming more uncomfortable so I decided to start heading in. I was heading west when I spotted what I thought was a bear down on all four drinking water from the edge of the lake my approximate coordinates were 34.277763, -110.071018 and when I first spotted the creature its coordinates were 34.277126, -110.072090 off the point at the bend of the lake (the lake is a sideways \"L\" shape. As I got closer to the creature still thinking it was a large black bear I saw it stand up on its two hind legs and look towards me. The creature then turned and walked into the wooded area behind it where I lost sight of it. The small time frame in which I did see the creature walking depicted very similarly to the Patterson video this creature about 7-8' tall longer arm length reaching towards its mid thigh and walking with a very long stride and a hunch. The creature appeared to have a reddish brown color to it a few shades darker than an orangutan. After losing sight of the creature I was unable to catch it in my sight again. With the storm right behind me and lightning all around I did not want to be on the lake in a 12' aluminum boat so I headed back to shore.",

This subject was quite different in its size, color and movement leading him to be very confident that this was not a bear or a human. He did not see any other people on or around the lake during this trip.He estimates his distance from the subject to be around 250 yards and the distance he watched it walk back to the woods to be about 50 yards, allowing him to make a very reasonable assessment of what he was seeing....",
