            "Follow-Up Report": "Through the investigatory process, I was able to track down the individual involved in the accident. The person confirmed the event and all details as reported to me. At first, when I introduced myself and told the person that I investigated sightings of bigfoot and that there had been recent sightings in the area where the accident took place, the individual was somewhat reticent, but began to open up as the conversation evolved. The individual could give few other details other than those mentioned in the report above. The witness did not submit the report; I submitted the report due to the circumstances surrounding the event, chief among them being the willingness and availability of the individual involved in the accident.Additional details:* The individual remembered the face as appearing \"fuzzy.\" * Although the individual had no idea what was standing upright \"on the yellow lines in the middle of the highway,\" the individual completely ruled out a human as a possibility. The individual told me that \"even a drunk human\" would have budged when the horn was honked; this figure simply would not move, and the motorist gave way. The individual repeatedly told me that they simply did not know what it was.  * The figure was \"bigger than a child\" and was \"between five and eight feet tall.\" It should be noted that three feet is quite a variance in height, but the witness repeatedly told me that only the most obvious aesthetic details could be retained and height remained an uncertainty; \"five feet to eight feet\" was a guess. The figure was upright; had \"long hair like a woman;\" refused to yield its ground in the middle of the highway; was bigger than a child, but no taller than eight feet. No clothing could be remembered by the individual. The witness was adamant that the figure was not human, but was completely uncertain what it was.This witness cannot be accused of \"bigfoot on the brain,\" as some suggest of witnesses, because the witness did not file a report; I sought the individual out and used investigatory tools to pursue before finally managing to track the person down. While the individual was certain that the figure was not human, I remain uncertain and cannot rule out a human simply because it is my assessment that the witness could not remember enough detail to preclude a human, although the behavior attributed to the figure seemed certainly non-human. For this reason I have classified this report as Class B. Conversely, I do remain open to the possibility that the figure was a sasquatch, given the figure's behavior which was certainly animal-like in that it seemed to freeze in the headlights as animals often do, and a sasquatch does seem to match the description given by the witness. In addition, it seems improbable that a human would be standing in the middle of a highway winding through the Big Thicket at 04:30 playing \"chicken\" with a motor vehicle running somewhere around 65 - 70 miles per hour, although this does remain a possibility, albeit remote. Further, the recent spate of sasquatch sightings in the Big Thicket National Preserve also enables me to remain open about the sasquatch possibility. Finally, it is worth noting that when I made mention of the figure possibly being a sasquatch or bigfoot, the witness could not dismiss it.   ",

Mile marker 1 i just came from and before i get to 2 I park my car up on hill there, so I come down to the trail run over the bridege to mile marker 1, turn around and then run all the way to mile marker 3, then back to my car, so 6 miles. Anyway i was heading to the 2 mile mark (or kilometer mark, can't recall) and i was coming around the bend and i can see more than a half, maybe 2 thirds mile down the path, not sure, and i see a big guy weasring a coat. walking in the way i'm running. As i got closer It looked furry and i thought why would someone be wearing a coat it's 65 degrees or more out! As i jogged closer, the thing got bigger (it had it's back toward me) and I stopped, got the chivvers and thought...that is a bigfoot...then the thing went around the bend ahead where there's a small stream and retention pond. It was still daylight and i kept running thinking it couldn't have been...but i ran another mile and there was no one there...where did it go? On the way back i stopped at a whole in a fence by a stream and small pond and lookeed in there. it was pitch black and then i got the chills and thought that thing might be in there...i went back to my car and have not run on that trail since! Finding Bigfoot show reminded me of this.",
