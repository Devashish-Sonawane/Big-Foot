I have done research on these stories years ago, in fact the local paper here, the Paducah Sun, published one of the stories (The Beast of LBL) in a Halloween section of their paper some 17 years ago.  Origianlly I am not from here, so any tales of 'creatures in the woods' fasinated me to no end.",

Her sighting occurred somewhere between 10:30 am and noon.The sighting lasted from twenty to thirty seconds, with the animal remaining about 100 feet away in the shadows.  Although she couldn't see any facial features, she felt that it was staring at her - she had goosebumps, the hair on the back of her neck was standing up, and her legs were trembling with fear and excitement.The animal was \"eight feet to nine feet tall, at least,\" and was from three to four feet wide.  It was covered with hair that was darker than the tree trunks that were in the shadows.  It moved slowly and deliberately, and with caution, taking a few steps and then pausing, and then a few more steps and pausing again.  The witness saw it take about eight to ten steps in this fashion before she left the area.According to the witness, \"Land Between the Lakes\" is located about twenty miles, as the crow flies, from the site of this sighting.",
