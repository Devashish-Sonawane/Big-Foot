            "Follow-Up Report": "-After interviewing the witness and in response to my questioning, and consistent with my notes, he provided the following account in his own words of other unusual occurrences.  \"In November of 1992 or 1993, I was rifle hunting for deer near (edited), NE.  I again was near the Niobrara River. Late in the afternoon, I had shot a doe and failed to find it before dark.  The next morning I returned at first light with hopes of finding the carcass intact.  What I found near where I'd shot the deer was the following:  an area about 12-15 feet in diameter with the tall grass and vegetation flattened as if by a steamroller.  In the center of the area was four feet and partial legs of a deer, lengths of about a foot.  I picked up one of the legs to take a closer look and noticed it was wet, and had a urine odor.  I have found deer and other animals which had been devoured by coyotes and in all cases there was hair, blood, and body parts scattered about. This was not the case here.  All I could find was the four legs.  At the time I was confused about what I had found but did not link it to what I had seen in 1974.      In November of 1995, again hunting for deer in the same area near (edited), I was returning to the tree stand I had placed that morning near an active deer trail.  Before I left the stand I had placed some of my hunting gear (military web belt with suspenders with a small fanny pack, canteen, and flashlight) between the ladder part of my stand and the tree.  I was probably about 30 yards from my stand when I heard this loud grunt or sigh coming from a heavy willowed area about 40 yards past my stand.  I could not pinpoint the direction from which it came.  For some reason I froze and immediately had the feeling something was watching me. After a few minutes I moved on to my stand. I thought that maybe the sound could have been made by an elk which had been spotted in the area earlier that year.  Reaching my stand I found my gear had been removed from where I had left it.  It was about 3 feet away from the tree and was strung out.  I thought that maybe a deer had smelled the tarsal gland scent and somehow moved it from the tree.  I ascended the stand and began to wait for deer movement.     While in the stand I could often hear movement and limbs and branches being broken in the heavy willowed area to the south.  It was getting to be later in the afternoon and I wasn't seeing any deer coming from the active trail.  A few does came from the west towards the stand, none of them coming close enough for me to get a shot.  Finally a buck showed up and after a while he approached one of my tarsal gland scent markings.  I took a shot at him but missed and when I was preparing for another shot I again heard this loud grunt/sigh sound.  Immediately the buck bolted away from the sound.  At the same time I noticed a few other deer left the area in the same manner.  After a few minutes I descended the stand and left the area.  At the time I thought it could have been a cow or some other large animal dying or injured.  I also considered it could have been something of the nature of what I'd seen in 1974.     I returned the next morning with the idea to move my stand closer to the west.  After finding a spot in that area, I left my bow and gear and went to retrieve my stand.  I got my stand without incident, set the stand up at the new location and I placed tarsal gland scent markings around the stand to attract the bucks, ascended the stand to wait.  After about 45 minutes to an hour I noticed a buck deer coming through the brush northeast of the stand.  When he got to about 25 yards from the stand he froze and appeared to be looking at something on the ground behind my stand.  He was well covered by brush and I did not have a clear shot at him, so I decided to wait.  After 5 or 10 minutes passed he turned and ran away from the stand.  At this time I didn't know if he had scented me or what alerted him.  I used my grunt call to get him to return.  Immediately after using my grunt call, something ran up behind the stand tree from what appeared to be where the deer was looking.  The thing moved through the heavy brush very rapidly and sounded to be very big, breaking limbs and brush as it moved.  Instinctively I became very scared and couldn't move.  Something told me not to look at this thing.  I remember trying to look out of the corner of my eyes and I remember seeing my bow shaking.  I was never more scared in my life than then.  After what seemed like a long time I turned and looked around the area but could not see anything.  I waited probably 20-30 more minutes, descended the stand and left.    About 3 weeks later I returned to the area and found my stand.  It had been pulled from the tree and drug into a thicket of brush.  I regret the fact that I didn't look to see what it was, but I believe it was something of the nature which I saw in 1974.\"  -The witness no longer lives in the area but still prefers that the precise location not be revealed. \"There's something down there.\" He says the area is primarily very rural farm and ranch land which has seen little growth or development since the time of his experiences. He has not bowhunted again since the 1995 incident he described because he feels safer with a rifle.Coincidentally, the day after I interviewed this witness, another unrelated person unaware of this report told me of a family member who had apparently noted a sighting not far to the north on the Yankton Indian Reservation. Also, the Santee Indian Reservation is not too far to the east. David Petti",
