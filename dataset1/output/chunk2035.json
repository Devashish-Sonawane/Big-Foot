            "Observed": "R. and I were walking up the road at about 6:30 pm. We were doing a follow up investigation of the area after hearing of a sighting of bigfoot. We had some wood and paper but I forgot matches at the truck so we had to turn around and walk back to the truck. We had walked through a half mile of woods and through a clearcut about half mile wide. On the way back to the truck and upon leaving the clearcut and entering the woods, I felt the hair raise on the back of my neck and I thought it might be because it had gotten dark and my senses were playing tricks on me. But after walking through the woods a quarter mile and getting closer to the truck, we both heard very distinct and loud knocking of a piece of wood striking another piece of wood about 12 - 15 times. The noise was coming from near my truck. Then we heard two more and it stopped. We got to my truck and I realized I had left my dome light on. We grabbed my spotlight and waited near the truck for a half hour to hear more knocking and we also knocked two pieces of wood together ourselves but couldn't get a reaction. I shined the spotlight into the forest and suddenly we heard what sounded like a big man take off at a sprint though the woods. I know what deer and elk sound like and this sounded like two feet running through the woods at a sprint. This was no deer or elk. My heart started pounding. We waited at the truck until 8 pm when another truck came down the road so we left. We didn't hear anything else but noticed the dogs would start barking in certain areas and then stop but I didn't think that was significant evidence of anything unusual.",

Its very remote, you have to travel down many back dirt roads to get to the campground .We have went camping up at Tippy dam for years, always in the spring to do a lot of fishing, day and night fishing. It was after midnight when we got up there in 2012 and we set up tents and the girls all went to sleep. Me and my brother and 12 yr old son took the boat out for some night fishing. We got back into this cove, the Tippy dam pond is huge, they call it the flooded forest. Its beautiful you could swear you were in Canada, very hilly. Huge hills back up to the water but all forest in every direction, very very remote. We were fishing sitting in the dead quiet when all of a sudden we were scared out of our minds!!! A huge rock that must have been the size of a bowling ball was thrown at are boat. At first we blew it off as if it were a fish jumping all though the distinct sound of a round ball hitting water is unmistakeable. So about 3 mts. went by when another one was thrown even closer to the boat. There was no way this was a fish, we shined a flashlight through the woods and could hear something moving fast thru the brush but could not make out what it was ..this area we were fishing is so remote there is no way any human would be out there let alone in the middle of the night ..I've never seen my brother scared, we are Michiganders, we deer hunt yearly spend days in the woods but we were scared that night. Something did not want us in that lil cove fishing and it was hurling huge rocks at us ta get us outta there and it worked lol. We started the boat and flew back to camp and woke the girls....",
