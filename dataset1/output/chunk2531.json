            "Observed": "We heard a strange sound the summer of 1975 on the Little Wenatchee River near Rainy Creek. My mother had come to visit and we took her to a replanted clear-cut at the base of Mt. Howard (SE of the bridge that crosses the Little Wenatchee River). The clear-cut was about 300 to 350 yards in diameter. We were going to camp near its base. We also had my mother\u2019s dog \u2019Lady\u2019 with us and its scent may have brought about the confrontation. We heard a very loud roar coming from the other side of the cut. The creature was hiding in the tall timber out of view. Imagine a very, very deep voiced man making a rough sounding lion roar. Imagine that he has a microphone, amplifier, and good speakers: that is what it sounded like. I thought it might be a black bear and so I fired my 357 revolver into the air 3 times to scare it off (generally I have found that enough to warn off a bear, especially in areas where they are hunted). But I was immediately shocked to find that instead of running the beast roared louder in rage and more rapidly: Raaaa! Raaaaa! Raaaaaaa! My 357 seemed to me to shrink to the size of a BB gun, and we threw everything in the car and left. I have heard lions at the zoo roar, but this was louder and more like something you would hear in a 1950s monster movie. I was young in those days and I didn\u2019t desire to go up an see the beast making that noise, but now that I am older and realize the real destination of life, I wish I had.",

            "Observed": "We were camped at an old abandoned mining town and mine near Deadwood Res. in Oct. 1996. Our son had an encounter with an unidentifiable being. My husbands company was helicopter logging near an area that was once an old town and mine out in the forest. It was opening day of the deer season, and our son, who was 14 at the time, got up early to go hunting near camp. We were near Deadwood River, which was little more than a creek. He took out with his rifle to see if he could get a buck that morning. He crossed the river and went up a hill to where he could get a better look at the river and flats below. Our pilots were camped down the river about a quarter mile from our camp.As our boy was looking down towards the pilots camp, he observed what he thought was a bear down on the flats near the river. He thouht that it was a little unusual that the 'bear' was walking very steady on it's hind legs more like a human. The more he watched it, the more uncomfortable he began to feel. As he was watching it, it suddenly looked up and started staring back at him. He felt sudden fear race through him as he felt it's eyes lock onto him. He told us that he has never felt that feeling before or since then. He said that it was very dark in color and was very tall and hairy,  After it had stared at him for a time, it proceeded in walking towards where he was standing. Realizing that it was moving in his direction, he turned around, and started racing for camp as fast as he could. When he got to camp, he ran into our fifth wheel trailer, shut the door and locked it behind him. He then closed all the curtains and blinds. He was absolutely scared to death that the thing that he saw was coming to get him. He wouldn't come out of our camper at all until I took him home two days later. He kept the door locked all the time, and the curtains drawn, even in broad daylight",

He said that it was about 3:a.m and he was waiting behind his truck for it to fill up.He had the floodlights on so he could see the hose in the water. He said that he had an overwhelming feeling that he was being watched.The Deadwwod River is quite shallow and not very wide, so the other side of the river is very close.(about25 feet across) He told us that he looked up and across the river to a set of eyes that were watching him from behind a tree on the other side of the river.It was very large and dark and had very piercing eyes. He said that it was much taller than a man, and moved upright and quietly from one tree to another, all the time, watching him. He said that he had driven water truck for many years, and he had never encountered anything like that before. He put in his resignation the next day after his sighting.",
