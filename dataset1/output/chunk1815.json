Being from Nebraska I am very familiar with most areas of the state because of my hunting and fishing habits.  I brought up the fact that most shelter belts would have a three strand barbed wire fence around it to protect it from cattle and he agreed that this one did.  I then mentioned that the creature would have had to step over the fence to walk into the tree line.  His reply was that he never saw the animal hesitate or change its gait to cross the fence.  The stiff North wind making the long hair blow in front of it was brought up several times.  The long arm length was also repeated by the witness.",
