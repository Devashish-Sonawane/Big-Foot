            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness for nearly an hour. Though we talked of course, a good bit about the incident, we also spoke of not letting this incident ruin his love of the outdoors and hunting. He has had time to relive the incident, and he has decided that he is going back out very soon to hunt and fish. I will go down the report line by line and add what was gathered during our conversation.As stated, he was in his stand, 16 feet up, back against a tree. Very wide tree and he and his stand cannot be seen from directly behind. 5:30-6pm in November so it is getting dark. He stated he sees pretty well at night. He was not using any lighting device at the time. Deer were plentiful and he saw several, including the small buck he mentioned. After the small buck entered the open field and looked/sniffed around at the direction he had come from, it left. He then heard something coming through the woods quite loudly, not being stealthy or covert at all. His initial thought was someone on a 4 wheeler or a big buck, crashing through the woods from the same general direction the buck had come from. Thinking it was perhaps a trophy deer, he froze and just listened. As stated, it stopped about 8 yards behind him, just past a small creek/river bank. As it stood there breathing, this is when he realized that it was something else, something quite huge. He could hear and almost feel, it breathing. It was \"huge, guttural, and you could hear the mass of the creature\". Even though 25 feet or so away, he knew this was not an animal sound he was familiar with. It then began sniffing the air, (conjecture here) both looking for the direction of the deer and perhaps sensing the presence of the witness. He was hunting scent free that night, meaning he was not masking his human scent.  Being 16 feet up and completely blocked by the tree, it is entirely likely the creature did not see him, but may have sensed (smelled) his presence. It began moving around a bit and as he started to grab his bow he heard two loud tree knocks. It did not knock on his tree, but one closer to the creek, or general area it was standing in. By this time he was still reaching for the bow and had his hand on it. when 2 loud screams rang out. \"Shook the entire woods and I physically felt it\". In his words \"it was like yelling at me hey.....hey....\" By this time it was almost directly behind the tree he was standing in, no more than a body length below him. It was pacing slightly, and began sniffing the air once again. It was loud sniffing, drawing in huge amounts of air as though it was on to something. Nothing he had ever heard or \"felt\" (breathing) before. As it began to move off to the west a bit, (witness was facing south), he looked to the left at his 11 o'clock position, and hit his headlamp. This is when he saw the creature, black, 700-800 lbs, from the back. \"Big, powerful, muscular\" and it went up the river bank, away from him, and disappeared into the woods. It was approximately twelve yards away when he saw it. He did not see the face.  He had an ever so slight side view for a split second, more like the back of the head and side where an ear would be.  He did not see an ear.  Hair was moving when he hit it with his headlamp, and it appeared dark brown or black.  Witness is an experienced outdoorsman and hunter, and as stated, 30 years in the woods, and is more than familiar with any and all wildlife in the area. He was truly physically and emotionally shaken by the event at the time, and vowed he was never going back into the woods again. He has since had time to reflect and decided that his love of nature and hunting has won out over any concerns he had over the event. For this investigator, to have a grown man, hunter and woodsman, admit he was frightened by \"something\" in the woods, takes a lot of courage, especially to a complete stranger. This, coupled with other known activity in the area, gives me no reason to doubt the veracity of this witness.Numerous reports from this area, Monkey Mountain Park Reserve is close by. ",
