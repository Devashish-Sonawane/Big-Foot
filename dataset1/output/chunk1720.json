            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length and found her to be a very credible observer, and quite certain what she saw was not a bear.  The witness was a counselor at the summer camp where this incident occurred, although at the time she and her adult friends were camping at another part of the ranch just off the water at a public beach.  She and her friends were in sleeping bags with no tents or vehicles, having climbed down a hill to access the camping area.  When the witness awoke and saw the creature, she was unable to wake any of her friends even after punching one with her fist.  In describing the creature she noted that \"It seemed very tall, slim in the middle with broad shoulders.\"  The witness was not aware of any smell, nor did she hear any sounds emanating from the creature.  The duration of the sighting was approximately two minutes total.  The following morning the witness, along with an over 6' tall male friend, swam across the river to look for tracks along the sandy bank.  The shore on the side of the river where the creature was spotted consisted of approximately 20' of sand that graduated into the tree line.  They were able to locate prints in the moist sand in the exact place the witness had seen the creature run the night before.  The male friend tried to duplicate the stride and size of the print with his own bare foot while running in a similar curved path. In comparing the two sets of tracks, the width across the ball of the friend's footprint was approximately 5\" across, however the width of the print left from the creature was 7\" - 8\" across.  The witness also noted that there were only four toes visible in the creature's track.",

The creature was crossing the road in the front of a vehicle that I was operating, it leaped from about the center line of the road to the bank which was on the right hand side I estimate the distance of this leap to be about 15 or more feet , a passenger was riding with me and had also seen this occur. It was obvious to me that this creature was making every effort to get out of sight into the cover of brush  and the darkness as fast as it could without injuring itself. The creature never went to a four legged position before it leaped or after it landed the creature remained on two legs for the brief period that it was visible.",
