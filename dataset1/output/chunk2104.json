            "Follow-Up Report": "After visiting with this witness by phone at length, she added the following:The creature was close enough to her car she could not see the feet due to the car hood. She also stated the length of the creature from front to back was not as wide as her car, but more than half as wide. She again stated the fact there was no \"flank skin\" on the animal and was very sure about there being no extended nose or jaw. The area of this siting is within a few miles of an area called the \"Devil's Washpan\". It is an area about 10 miles in diameter and is heavily forested. \"The young bigfoot caught on a game cam\" she is referring to is known as the Jacobs Creature. After my conversation with this witness, it is my conclusion that she could have seen a large juvenile bigfoot. ",

We were traveling up the hill where the rvs are sold on the right hand side near the gas facility. I was driving at 45 MPH When my uncle says \" what the hell is that?\" I asked what he saw and his reply was \" what ever it is it was walking on two feet. The sighting was quick no longer then 5-6 seconds at a distance of 70 yards on a cloudless moon lit night.My uncle said the subject was walking up the steep embankment that is covered in almost a foot of snow and bare of trees or brush behind the rv building on a horizontal path on two legs towards the woodline on top of the hill. He described the color as a uniform black. With no distinguishing clothing. The size he said was at least his size maybe bigger. my uncles is 6'4\" and 250 pounds and he even said it was the size that caught his eye. We can't think of any reason a person would try to traverse such a steep incline or even going to the top of the hill cause there is nothing but woods once u reach the top. My uncle said it was spooky because he couldn't think of any reason either. I laughed and jokingly said it was bigfoot and with that my uncle started rambling about even if it was. No one would believe us. So I am contacting u to see if you guys could maybe solve this for us.",

He added this to his account:Although when he first submitted the report he did so for his uncle, the witness did confirm that he had also gotten a glimpse of the figure. He said that what struck them both as odd is how it was walking easily up a snowy hill at a 70 degree incline without the use of its hands or arms, without zigzagging, and at a good pace in 6\u0094 of snow. It was dark out, but the moon allowed them to see its silhouette. He said it had very broad shoulders. The arms stayed at its side, and there was no evidence of clothing in the freezing cold weather. The witness suggested that they stop and look for tracks, but as they were unarmed, his uncle was nervous and didn\u0092t want to stop. ",
