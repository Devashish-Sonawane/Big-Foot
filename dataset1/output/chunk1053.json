The east side was less steep and heavily wooded but only had a rise of about 100 feet.",

They seemed unconcerned. They didn\u0092t talk or turn towards each other just walked out of the tree line and straight across and into the woods. I couldn\u0092t figure where they came from or where they were going, especially without equipment. They seemed black in color like I said from head to toe and it seemed to shine slightly as they moved, but didn\u0092t appear to be clothing.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After a telephone interview with the witness, the following details can be added to his report:The witness reported seeing the larger creature first, followed by the second, smaller creature as they emerged from the tree line and crossed the river.The creatures did not appear to look either direction as they emerged from the trees or as they crossed the river.  The witness reported they seemed to walk with great confidence and purpose.He reports the creatures' heads to be set upon their shoulders, with no visible neck.  He also reports the heads did not appear human-like in nature, as they had a somewhat conical appearance to them.  He stated, \u0093The heads were not rounded like a human head.\u0094The witness stated he was unable to discern any type of clothing of any sort on these creatures.  He reported the creatures to be rather muscular, with no change in appearance or color in their body covering from head to foot.He also reported they crossed the river with great ease, as if they were \u0093walking through a puddle.\u0094  He reported the water came to an area just short of their knees.He reported to me he observed no vehicles of any sort adjacent to the river in that area, nor did he observe anyone in or about the river.He stated he was alone at the time of these sightings and knew of no other witnesses to what he observed.The witness went on to report he proceeded down the highway a bit farther, stopped at the next location he could view the river and waited for a short time, but was unable to see anything unusual.  He reported no obvious human activity in that area at all.The witness further reported to me he is an avid outdoorsman, and a trained observer.  He stated he had never seen anything like these creatures before in his life.  And in that respect, it took him a couple of months to come to grips with what he had experienced that day in Northern California.",
