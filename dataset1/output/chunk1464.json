When he saw the creature, he noticed that it was walking away from him, 'leaning' forward walking into some brush and trees.  He knew it wasn't a bear or a moose, and based upon what he seen, he later  estimated it to stand near 9 feet tall.  The impressions later found in the soil were 2.5-3\" deep, while no impressions were able to be made by the witness or the others with him.  He had also heard some heavy, bipedal walking in this same area on another occasion.  ",

In the fall of 2002 in october at around 2am my wife stepped out on our porch it was a unusually mild night clear with stars shining . My wife called out for me to come out and join her when she did there was a loud commotion up on the hill beside our house. There was a series of loud screams and thrashing as if something large had been startled by the sound of her voice the screams were unlike any animal I have ever heard and whatever it was was running at full speed through the woods breaking branches as it went . We were both quite shaken and the next morning I went up to site to see if I could find anything but there were no tracks as the ground in the spot is hard and gravelly. I have hunted and fished the area for many years but have never had an incident like that nor have I ever heard any animal in the north country make a sound like those screams",
