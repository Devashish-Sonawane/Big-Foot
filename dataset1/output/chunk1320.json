            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness by phone.He and a friend were taking a long weekend doing some four wheeling on the designated trails in the Uwharrie National forest. He was traveling alone but his friend, friend's wife and 3 kids accompanied him. It was his first trip to the area, but the friend had been there previously with no activity. They were awakened their last night at about 1am.by bipedal walking around their campsites. The animal was not trying to be quiet, it walked very heavily breaking limbs and branches and was very large by their estimates.The three adults all heard it and were awakened.The next morning his friend asked him if he had heard it? He answered yes but was in and out of sleep. They tried to rationalize the sounds and ruled out deer, horses or bears as it was definately very large and heavy, and walking in a bipedal manner.The witnesses did not hear any vocalizations or knocks, no footprints were found.They did have coolers and totes of food but nothing was noticed moved or missing. There was only one other camper in the campground at the time..This campground is a modern facility with 48 campsites. It is surrounded by heavy forest to the East and Badin Lake just to the west.There are numerous water sheds in the area including the Uwharrie River,and Yadkin River which is dammed up to form Badin Lake and Lake Tillery. Wildlife is abundant including whitetail deer, raccoons,opossums, bobcats, black bear, and lots of migratory waterfowl.The Uwharrie National Forest has had a long history of Sasquatch sightings and activity. Montgomery County has nine reports in the BFRO data base. It is very close to the area where the Greene's Thermal footage was taken.",

            "Observed": "I was hunting the training areas in Ft. Bragg, NC. in 1995 and had planned to hunt a new area. I saw a valley on the map and plotted where I thought would be a good spot to set up a tree stand. I when in the woods about 0445 and got to the spot on the map and set up my equipment and climbed up about 24ft. All was quiet, and the sunrise began and the rays of the sun traveled across the forrest floor. I followed it with my eyes and as the sun reached in front of my tree stand a small, 3 ft., black, furry creature reared up from a sleeping position and ran away from the sun. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up!!! I don't know what it was. I have been hunting since I was 15 and have seen plenty of wild life in my time. I had a 30-06 semi-auto rifle and I was frozen stiff. Needless to say, I got the hell out of there and never went back. After all of these years, I now believe it was a \"child\" bigfoot.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "At the time of the encounter, observer was in the US Army at Fort Bragg, NC. In October 1995, the observer traveled to one of the available base hunting areas, XRAY2, to attempt to bag a deer. Observer describes the rural area as heavily populated with deer, fox, squirrel,and coyote; a bear population was also present in the area in 1995. It was then forested with pine and oaks typical of the region. Ample acorns and persimmon fruits were available for ungulates and other animals to forage. This location was chosen for hunting because of its close proximity to a gentle slope, field edges and a valley. Water sources were available in the area consisting of a small waterway (Horse Creek) and adjacent lakes and ponds. Observer arrived at the tree stand location in the dark, navigating with a red headlamp, (approximately 4:45 a.m.) and prepared all his hunting equipment. At approximately 6:45-7:00 a.m., observer states the sun began to rise and subsequent observations follow. Observer was located in a tree stand 24 feet up and looked down at an animal moving approximately 6 feet from his tree. He stated that at first view the animal seemed surprised by the sun; it jumped up on two legs and, \u0093ran a couple of steps, then went to all fours.\u0094 The animal was not, in his opinion, a bear or dog. He estimated the duration he viewed the animal as 6 seconds, and during this period it traveled an estimated 30 yards, its head down, moving towards cover until it was noiselessly gone from his view. Observer described the animal as thick and stocky, approximately 3 feet tall and weighing approximately 80 pounds. The head and face were not visible, no distinct neck was seen, and arm length was estimated at 2 feet long. Shoulders were clean of debris. The feet were small, hairless, had an undetermined number of toes and bottoms of the feet were colored dark brown. Hands were black in color. No unusual odor was apparent. Body hair was approximately 4\u0094-5\u0094 long, black, shiny and less coarse than bear hair, but not as fine as human hair. Forest debris (twigs, grasses) were observed on the rear of the animal as it rapidly departed the area. No vocalizations were heard as the animal moved away. The observer did not remain at the location and did not attempt to view any tracks or impressions.  It is this Investigator's opinion that this 1995 sighting was likely a juvenile bigfoot. This determination is based on the credible testimony of the witness and local evidence concerning reported bigfoot behavior. The area is capable of supporting such an animal population, and several BFRO Investigators have previously reviewed and documented reports of footprint evidence and witness sightings at and near Ft. Bragg.",
