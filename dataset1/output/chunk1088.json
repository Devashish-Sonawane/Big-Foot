This area has many large marshes interpersed by conifer forest and is therefore very conducive sasquatches.Though there was not a sighting, even a shadow, several sensory observations converge to make this event compelling:First, the dogs indicated that something was in the woods. Whatever was making the unusual \"scree, scree\" sounds, this sound was described in the interview as being \"louder and heavier than a bird call.\"  Submitter has lived in the area for a long time so he should be familiar with all the normal bird sounds. Second, the witness described bipedal movement from the woods, so not a bird.  Then there was the rotten smell that eventually dissipated.",
