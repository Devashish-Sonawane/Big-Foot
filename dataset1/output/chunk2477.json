Keep in mind there is a cornfield in that direction, but what I saw was not a cow or bear or anything I could possibly explain. They simply don't stand on two legs. Tall, black, and very foul smelling. It must have been there when I came down the hill, I only saw it after I had been there awhile. I looked, when I heard the rustling. Standing not twenty yards from me, was something I will never forget, nor want to. There was no screaming beast [except for me]; Just a being looking at me!  I did, however notice that this \"being\" was very calm, looking at me. I on the other hand was not calm at all. It made a gesture [raising of arms] that was all I saw. I ran up the hill to my grandparents. My granddad asked me where my bike was - I told him I didn't know.",

It had long arms that were not in the same proportion as a human's. His impression was that it would have weighed over three hundred pounds. The witness also said that its face was pale with a fleshy area around the eyes and nose. He commented on how the animal's face looked somewhat humanlike and appeared to be shocked at his being in the area.  The youth stood and watched the animal for about twenty seconds and then turned and ran back up the hill to his grandparents. ",

I could hear something following me off to my side in the bushes. At first I thought it was an armadillo or something like that but I could not see anything when I would shine my flashlight in that direction. The movement sounded to be only about ten feet from me. Everytime I would stop, it would stop. Whenever I would shine my light over there I could see nothing. After it followed me for about a hundred and fifty yards I got a little scared and turned the flashlight off and took off running the rest of the way to my truck.",
