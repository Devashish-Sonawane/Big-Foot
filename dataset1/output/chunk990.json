            "Observed": "My buddy and I use to do a lot of cat fishing along the banks of the Ohio river and during the winter we would fish down at the hot water discharge for DP&L since the boilers kept the water in the low to mid 80's. We'd arrive at dusk and fish until around 8-9 am the following morning. Depending on how cold it was we would sometimes build a small fire to keep warm and help us to see our lines. On this particular day it was very cold but relatively clear skies with little to no wind. After walking down the winding trail from the highway to our regular spot we began to setup our poles. I cast my lines out and began to gather kindling and driftwood for a fire. While walking the banks for wood I noticed small barefoot human like footprints in the sand just at the waters edge. They were approximately 5-6 inches in length but abnormally wide and surprisingly deep. I remember thinking that it was awfully odd that someone would allow their child to run around barefoot during the winter, especially in an area that was littered with random fish hooks and broken glass. I pointed it out to my buddy and we joked about it. We brushed it off as a freak occurrence and didn't discuss it any further. Only after our later experiences hearing vocalizations, wood knocks and having rocks thrown at us did I realize that we might have been experiencing Sasquatch activity, and that the tracks we observed that day might have been left by a juvenile.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking to the fisherman, it was apparent to me the man's experiences were credible. The prints he saw came from the woods, out into the heated creek, but did not return. The next fishing trip resulted in being howled at, tree knocks and rocks being thrown at them from the woods behind them. As a note the power plant, of course, sends out power lines and after following some of them, they pass in close proximity to other sites of reported sightings. He and his friend have not returned to the site since 2010, his apprehension stems from how close in proximity the howls were and the distance the rocks were being thrown from. They packed up and left soon after having rocks thrown at them. The area is heavily wooded, and the nearest home is some distance down the road.",
