            "Follow-Up Report": "I have talked with the Mr.S (the one who was driving) over the phone on 3/13/01. I asked him a few questions about his encounter. He said that the Bigfoot ran from his right to left. The road he was driving on was a four lane road with a median that was over grown. Thick woods on both sides of the four lanes. Mr.S said that they had a clear view of the creature as it ran across the road, and that it looked to be carrying a small one in it's arms. Mr.S said that it had arms like \"Us\" and that it was carying a child like \"We\" would do in it's arms. He said it took one look at us and kept going into the woods. Between the woods (on his right) and the median Mr.S said was around 100 yards and it only took a few steps and it moved fast. The other witnesses also saw the creature as it moved, and all say that it had to have been a bigfoot the way it looked and moved. They said, that this was no bear. Not on two legs and moving like it did. Mr.S was around 70 yards in front of it as it went across the road. To this day, he said he's never seen anything like it before. He has seen shows on bigfoot on Discovery etc. but never thought he would see one for himself.There have been a few reports in that general area of FL. The Gulf Hammacks is pretty close to this area and very thick with forest. I have heard of a few stories about hunters being out there and hearing sounds that they had never heard before. Making a note of this for a possible stakeout in this area.",

            "Observed": "I was 14-15 years old. My father and I were camping with another father and son along the Brazos River. It was after midnight and my friend and I were running a trotline we had stretched across the river. As we approached the opposite bank from our campsite, we heard what was to this day an almost indescribable sound on the bank. It was a combination of a low frequency howl with varying low pitch grunts and growls. We immediately froze and shined our flashlights at the bank. There was a steep drop off into the river with a patch of evergreen shrubs and driftwood about the size of a single car garage. This vegetation started a few feet from the water and extending two thirds of the way back up the bank. Our flashlights were poor, as were most from this time period, and we could see nothing. We were within 30 feet of the bank and we both knew exactly where the sound originated. Whatever we heard was behind the described vegetation, so it was obscured. A second vocalization occurred within 10-15 seconds of the first.",
