            "Observed": "On the last day of hunting season just before dark my friend and I were walking slowly on an old logging road. We were heading through an area where a small spring crossed under the old road. The forest was very dense on one side of the road and clear cut 30+ years prior on the other side so there was alot of brush, but still quite open. Just then about 50 ft into the dense thicket above us we hear a very loud breathy yell followed by what sounded like a large stick hitting a tree. We were so close that we could feel the percussion in our chests from its yell, and the knocks echoed for miles. We both checked to make sure that our rifles were loaded not knowing what the noise was we make our way back to our spots we had chosen to sit until dark. Over the coarse of about an hour it yelled about 50-60 times following each yell with 1-2 wood knocks per yell. There were no other people that had access to the area and we saw no one else all the way down the mountain. My friend never spoke a word of it to anyone and has since past away (RIP) it scared him so bad he never said a word to anyone what we had experienced.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness spends most of his time in the outdoors.  He is a long-time hunter and works in the logging industry.  He is very familiar with the local wildlife.  The details he recalled reflect his observant nature.  He was some-what reluctant to talk about his experience and still feels anxious when he thinks about this particular incident.  He and the other hunter could hear the subject take a breath before it bellowed, so they knew they were close and that it was big.  He further described the tree knocks as aggressive, estimating the number of knocks to be over 80.  There were over 50 yells and one to two knocks per yell.  They didn\u0092t know what it was, but weren\u0092t feeling much fear at the time since they had high powered rifles.  When they realized what was probably out there after seeing the show on the Discovery Channel, some fear crept in.  His friend was a big man who wasn\u0092t afraid of anything, but he never talked about what they heard, even to his own family.  His friend never went back to that area and never hunted again.

            "Observed": "A friend and I were walking home from Sunrise Elementary school in the spring. This is on South Hill in Puyallup. There was an area of woods we had to go through between gravel pits to get home. We were on an overgrown old logging road that had a ditch on one side. It was on our left as we walked. We were also not too far from some power lines. Both of us had sticks and we were chopping down dandee lions along the trail as we walked. My friend was in front and I was about 20 feet behind him chopping what he had missed. As I got to a big patch he missed, I stopped and started chopping away as my friend kept walking. The ditch was to my back now. Suddenly, I felt like someone was behind me. I turned around and was pretty much face to face with a bigoot. It was about eight feet away from me. My guess is it was sleeping or hiding in the ditch and just stood up to see what was going on. It could have reached out and grabed me with no trouble. I think it was just as surprised to see me as I was to see it.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for forty minutes or so. He said the animal was in the ditch that was covered in Scotch Broom (a plant). He said the road wasn\u0092t very wide and the ditch was perhaps four feet deep. He estimates that he was four to four and one half feet tall at the time. The witness couldn\u0092t tell the sex of the animal since all he saw was from the chest up. He said it was \u0093really muscular\u0094. He remarked that it had a \"really big, broad chest\u0094.When I asked him if it reminded him of an orangutan he said that it was similar to an orangutan\u0092s hair, except darker. He kept saying the animal had \u0093coarse hair\u0094 and when I asked him what he meant by \u0093coarse\u0094 he compared the term \"coarse\" to a dog's hair. He said the hair around the face was darker than the hair on the rest of the body. He said the lips were fuller than an ape's lips. The head was \u0093pointy\u0094 and the hair on the head stood up.He says had not heard of bigfoot sightings before his encounter. He was sheltered from the bigfoot story because his family had recently moved to Washington from Detroit, MI about one year before the incident happened.",
