            "Follow-Up Report": "On the evening of the 17th of December of 2002, I made contact with William P. and he went over his brief encounter that he and his step father had when he was about twelve years old, on the north east side of Mount Shasta.  After the incident, they stayed up until morning. That following morning, they found the camp in disarray, and could only find the carton of eggs missing, which was a complete dozen.  The eggs were sitting out on the cook-stove table. After a little looking around, they found the egg carton a little ways from camp, with the top torn off, but did not see any of the eggshells, anywhere.  Nothing was missing from the ice chest, which held most of their food. They looked for tracks, but couldn\u0092t find any, due to the pine needles on the ground.The damage to the pick-up truck was a football sized dent, about a inch and a half deep, located in the aft panel, behind the rear wheel on the drivers side of their 1965 Chevrolet truck. When the damage took place to the pick-up truck, William thought that he was hit by another vehicle, because the truck moved, and it felt like he was just in an accident. Summery: William P. seemed sincere and believable in his encounter with an unknown creature.  The main reason that I made this report a class \u0093B\u0094, was the damage to the truck, and the fact that William thought it felt like an accident, and the screaming sounds, plus the ice chest was not opened. I would think that a bear would have opened that ice chest right away.  What I find most interesting was the fact that this creature possibly ate the complete egg, shells and all.  The both of them were frightened enough to stay up until the next morning. ",
