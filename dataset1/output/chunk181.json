            "Follow-Up Report": "On May 29, 2003 The BFRO received the following email: \u0093I have a buddy in lakeland florida that has a hunting camp in the gulf hammock area of north florida, He is a Business owner in the area and would like to speak to a researcher in the area. He has plaster casts that he made in 91 of a possible bigfoot. He also has access to pictures that his buddy took of the same prints with a yard stick or tape measure beside them. I can put you in touch with him if you have someone interested in looking at them.\"The investigator\u0092s contact information was passed to the witness; the BFRO did not hear from him and the report was closed.On April 12. 2015, the Florida BFRO received this email:Sunday, April 12, 2015 5:55 PMTo: Info@BFROFL.comSubject: Floridaprint casting\u0093I have a friend that lives in Lakeland, Florida. He has a printthat I have seen. It has dermal ridges and he has agreed to have it looked at. If you know anyone in the area that is qualified to inspect the print. When you reply I will give you the contact information for him.\u0094I was able to contact the witness and fellow Florida BFRO Investigator Joanna Cuva and I met him at his house. We were able to hear how the casts came about.Photo of the casts:He unwrapped the casts that were in newspaper dated March 1991. A toe on one of the casts was broken.  He chuckled that he had them tucked in a closet and forgot about them until recently. He admitted that although he owns these casts and saw the track, he still can\u0092t explain what could have made them. He admits he is somewhat skeptic when it comes to Bigfoot, but that is the only thing that could explain the find.He is a very credible, honest and humble man. These casts are 25 years-old and it is evident that he is not looking for any publicity or notoriety. The family has remained quiet about the find for the usual reasons of criticism and ridicule. His step\u0096father had a hunting cabin in Levy County on Spring Run for many years. The family spent many weekends hunting there.On one particular winter weekend in 1991, his step-father went to the cabin to open it up before everyone else arrived. He discovered the prints, drove back to town and used a pay phone to call home to tell them to make sure that they brought a camera with them. Once the family arrived, they were amazed to see the prints. Someone took photos and another drove back to town to purchase Plaster of Paris. The right print measured 18\" long and 8 1/4\" wide, the left measured 17 3/4\"  long and 7 3/4\" wide.The tracks came from the north, walking to the left of a footbridge over the creek. The creek was muddy and they were able to make casts from the prints there. They only took two \u0096 one of each foot without considering to make more. The tracks continued around their cabin and headed southeast. The footprints were not always visible but they were able to follow its trail by following broken branches and trees. It wandered down, then turned east and circled around three other vacant hunting cabins. The owners of these cabins were alerted to the presence of the footprints. The trail turned north again and crossed the creek, once again to the west of another footbridge before heading north and walking through a barbed wire fence breaking at least five posts.None of the cabins had been broken into. Each cabin had compost piles of garbage and areas where they dumped the remnants of the hunted animals. It appeared the creature had \u0093toured\u0094 those areas.The men scouted the area looking for more evidence and found what appeared to be a bedding area made from palm fronds. Near there they discovered several palms that had been pulled up with the hearts eaten. This was in an area they referred to as \u0093Tangerine Island\u0094; it had a tangerine tree on it and was high, dry ground surrounded by a wet marsh.Video footage the witnesses filmed about a week after the original discovery is included in the following video. The family has additional photographs that will be added at a later time.The witness claims that hunting was always very good in the area, and they never experienced anything unusual except for the footprint discovery. The family did not have a set schedule for visiting the cabin so they find it very unlikely \u0093someone\u0094 did this as a joke because of the effort and timing.  The step-father\u0092s name was Bill, and the family requests that in his honor the casts be referred to as \u0093Bill\u0092s Spring Run Casts\". ",
