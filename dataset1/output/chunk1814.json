            "Observed": "My encounter took place while leaving the Lake Barkley Resort.  My family and I were driving back toward the main road that leads to Cadiz, KY.  I was going about 50 miles per hour when I saw a deer run across the road. I thought I saw a tree next to the road but it was running.  It was taller then the top of my mini van and looked right at me,  we passed it in about 3 seconds.  I was not really sure what I saw so I turned around to see if it might have been a tree or something but there was nothing there.  I remember afterwards that it was a large creature, with tanish/brown fur around 7 feet tall with an almost Neanderthal brow and flatish nose.  It was hard to tell what color the fur was exactly since my headlights are tinted yellow. My son who was in the back seat also saw it and commented on it.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness described the creature to be approximately  7 to 7.5 feet tall and 3 feet wide, stocky with matted medium brown hair. She first saw the deer break brush and run along side her vehicle quickly dashing in front of her van and across the road. She originally mistook the creature for a tree or bush, but realized the creature was chasing behind the deer. She said as it past right outside the drivers side window it seemed to have a surprised look in its eyes. The creature was so close to the vehicle she could have reached out and touched it. The creature did not cross in front of her after the deer and the encounter lasted a few seconds. She could no longer see it as soon as it was out of the headlights.  Her husband was also in the vehicle but only her son saw it as well. I found the witness to be very forthcoming and genuine describing the sighting she and her son had that evening. She is originally from Washington State and possibly had an encounter with her Mother as a child.The encounter took place not far from the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area, where there have been numerous sightings of Bigfoot and the Beast of LBL.
