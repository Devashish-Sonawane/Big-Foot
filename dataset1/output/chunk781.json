            "Follow-Up Report": "Talked with the witness by phone.  The following details can be added to the report:--The area is very rough country.  There is a 2000-foot difference between the creek bottoms and the ridge tops.  Witness spent 14 non-continuous months in the area doing his Masters degree work (camping more than 150 times in the area).  He saw very few humans during that time.  Only trails were those near mines.  The best way to walk was by using the historic ditches.  The area was so remote, he had to use flagging to get in and out of the area.  Did see bear sign, but little else.--The print had dermal ridges across the entire foot.  No instep was visible.  It had a very wide ball.  Track was about 10-11 inches long, with a 20-inch stride.  He compared the prints to those in Grover Krantz' book and they looked very similar.  Also checked a podiatry web site to check different human foot types, none had the straight across features that the prints he saw had.--Scream described as a high/low-modulating scream.  He has heard lynx and cougar before, and it was not like that.  The screams/howls on the website were not similar.--The feces were three inches long by one inch wide.  He can't believe it would be human, as it was located more than a 15-hour hike from the nearest road.",
