            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness' father on 9/16/16.  He did not witness the sighting but gave permission to speak with his daughter later that day.  The second call enabled me to speak directly with her on speaker phone. We reviewed the statement given by her father, elaborating on specific details which interested me. She stated the creature was 25-30 or so feet away from her position, viewed out a window in her home.  She observed it walking through their yard and looking back at the house. It had a totally black, hair covered face with flat features. She has seen a gorilla, differentiating between them as the gorilla of approximately the same size but looked much bulkier in the upper body. It had longer arms than a man and walked in a very smooth manner. At one point, it looked directly at her making eye contact, totally unnerving her. The sighting occurred at around noon, a time when typically no one is home. She regularly goes to work with her mother during the summer, but this day she did not. Her observation continued for about two minutes. The creature crossed a fence and continued walking behind the fence crouching in an attempt to hide as much as possible. This was her second sighting. The previous one was also shared with a fellow student while riding the school bus. They were both looking out the same side window and had a fleeting glimpse of a white haired covered creature hiding as the bus passed. They both discussed what was seen and had not spoken of it with others on the bus. She was certain the sighting we discussed was a young Sasquatch.  Her sincerity and lack of hesitation in discussing details make me believe her identification is correct.",
