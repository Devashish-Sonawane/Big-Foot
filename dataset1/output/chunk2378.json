One night Iwoke up for no apperant reason but Iset up in bed and no sooner than I did I heard this very loud and distinct sound. Never knew what it was until on your site and was listening to sounds recorded of bigfoot. Then I realised what I heard was possibly a bigfoot. It ws a very distinct sound. The window was open were I had set up in the bed it sonded like what ever it was,was righ outside the window. Never dawned on me what it could have been,thought it was an elk or something. But now I,m pretty sure what i heard was a bigfoot.",
