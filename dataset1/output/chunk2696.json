            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness over the phone and gathered a strong sense that the experience, though not visual in nature, was life changing for him. It was mid morning on a beautiful spring day in Moraine State Park. While sitting in his boat about 30-40 yards from the shore line, the witness heard what sounded like two distinct wood knocks coming from an unpopulated forest back on shore. Shortly after the wood knocks three rock clacks could be heard about 300 yards west of his location. This back and forth exchange happened for about 10 minutes in a consistent and repetitive nature. There were only a couple other boats on the water at the time. The witness was alone and the experience caused the hair on the back of his neck to stand up. He said, \"I didn't necessarily feel like I was being watched, but I felt like I didn't belong there either.\"The witness has returned to the location since this incident and has noted that the area is more heavily overgrown with brush since then denoting that little to no human activity is occurring in this particular location.

I was less than 100 yards away when I initially saw it and by the time I got up to where it crossed all I could see was the backside of the creature cresting a hill out of sight. This was nothing that I have ever seen before. It walked in big strides unlike any animal known to me. To me, it was a Bigfoot.",
