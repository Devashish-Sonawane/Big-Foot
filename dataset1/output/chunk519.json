There are abundant elk, deer, wild turkey and snowshoe hare in the area along with grouse.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I called the witness to interview her. The area is quite a long distance away, and since there had been enough time for the snow to melt and the evidence would be gone, I elected to not go to the scene. This is a great location for a visit at a later date. I asked the witness to send me the photos that they had taken, which she did. After examining the photos, I had found that there were no visible toes in the best picture, although the other factors were compelling. Some of the pictures which showed some melt-out did indicate that there were toes, but these tracks were not of good quality. I e-mailed the witness asking about toes. When she answered, she said that when they looked at the tracks, they could definitely see toes, but that the camera did not pick them up. This sometimes happens due to the angle of light, the intensity of the light, and reflection of the snow. Here are some of the photos:This is the best picture showing a track. Note that the toes are not really visible. However, the size is very large.There is more indication of toes in this picture.Showing the step length and foot placement.Showing the track-line. Yellow lines indicate the tracks, so as to not be confused with the human tracks along side.This photo shows the conditions at the time.Contextual Information. The weather was below freezing. The creature came from the forest to the south, across a power-line right-of-way, through an icy stream, crossed a fence, walked though the yard, and out the front gate. The tracks were larger than a human in both length and width. The witness said that there were visible toes, which show up in some of the photos, although there has been some melt out. The step was measured at 56\u0094 and stride at 112\u0094, nearly 10 feet. The track line went on for a long distance, heading north towards Interstate 90. There was the reaction of the dogs, and vocalization heard by the husband.Conclusion. The additional contextual information above makes it almost certain that this track line was made by a sasquatch. It is unlikely that there is a very large human running around in below-freezing night time temperatures, crossing a stream, ice, and then continuing over a fence through a yard and down the road barefoot in the snow.I will be following-up on some of the other information supplied by the witness.",
