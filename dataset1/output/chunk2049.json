I just crossed the Caster river bridge on the county road that now belongs to Golden Cat to transport their mineings. I saw a dark brown creature run across the road in front of me. It was on two legs jumped across the road and ran into the woods. Was gone in just seconds. I will never forget this, and have only told my wife until now. This is for real and I would like to hear from you!",
