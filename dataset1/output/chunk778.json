They did not have a computer at the time to send in this report. This is the  story as it was told to me (David Sidoti).When I first got started with the BFRO, I told a few guys at work what I was doing. After they all laughed at me, one guy came up to me later and said that I need to talk to his wife about some thing she saw years ago with her girl firend. This was her report after I talked to her personally at their home. I feel she was truthful in what she told me, and her girl friend stands by the story also. Her girl friend never talks about that day, and they have never been back in that area ever since.The area has been built up over the 15 years and there hasn't been any other sightings in that one area.",
