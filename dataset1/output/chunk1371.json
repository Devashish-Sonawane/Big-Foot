It's very flat in this area, although it does start to get somewhat hilly just to the north of where my friend lived--very few trees, just miles of open farmland, and very little population. He lived on a stretch of gravel road that extended about 2 miles west off of HWY 281, and there are a few other farm houses along the same road.",

He was at this friend's house 6-7 miles north of Aberdeen.  The friend was described as an outdoorsy type, hunting, fishing, and generally playing around outside.  They were talking in the basement, when they heard something better than one hundred yards distant.  I asked how he knew this, he said it's because the parents of the friend had a street lamp that illuminates a distance of fifty yards in each direction.  He said that the sound was coming from a field of corn.  I asked for a description of the sound, he said sort of like a howl.  I played the howl from Ohio in 1994, he said that it was similar, but different.  When I inquired how, he said it wasn't so loud, more controlled.   I asked about the duration of the sound or howl.  Witness said it had a period of about two seconds, but went on for about ten minutes, like whatever made the sounds was calling, attempting to elicit a reply, and trying to be discreet about it.  He compared it to a cow in volume, but stated that it was not a cow. ",

Next to the woods has always been a farm field, usually grown with alfalfa and around 150 acres; leading up to the brush pile is long, tall grass with sparse trees here and there with an old barn and old house nearby (both abandoned).",
