            "Observed": "I have reported before on this website. I live in a rural area in west-central Indiana. I have heard strange primate-like calls coming from the woods behind my residence for about eighteen months. About two weeks ago, I heard powerful whooping calls coming from our woods as I was changing a tire on my car at about 10PM. These calls were followed by wood knocks. The calls sounded like those I have heard on this site. I have been an amateur bigfoot researcher for many years, and am convinced that one, possibly more, are inhabiting the woods behind my house.",
            "YEAR 2": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness by phone about what he, and on some occasions his father, have heard near their home. They started hearing these whoops and howls in the summer of 2006.  These sounds always occur at night; sometimes starting after dusk and lasting until 3-4 am, or starting around midnight, but lasting only an hour or so.  Yet there is no set pattern on when these sounds will be heard.  In other words, it cannot be predicted when they will occur.The howl is described as starting very low and drawn out, and rising in pitch to a high scream, then tapering off (about 6-10 seconds in length).  If a response occurs, it is the same type of howl, and usually comes from the opposite side of the woodland behind the house.  This happens within a minute of the first howl.  The whoops (such as the ones heard while changing his car tire) are quick and high-pitched, usually 3 or 4 at a time.During July of 2008 the witness and a friend camped in the forest behind his house.  Prior to settling in for the night, they made their own 'whoop' sounds and wood knocks. About 12:30 AM they got 3-4 whoops in reply, which sounded about 40 yards away from their camp.  These were described as coming from something with 'a lot of lung capacity'.  After 10 seconds the whoops occurred again, along with some movement in the brush from the general direction the noises were coming from.  Nothing else happened that night.From another submitted report by the witness, he stated  - 'What struck me initially was the power behind these calls; it would take an animal with tremendous lung capacity to make them carry like they do.' This other report was not published.The area near the home contains many pockets of forests among the farm fields.  There are also many small waterways connecting these pockets, and the area is heavily populated with deer and turkey.",
