The submitter is very adept with field audio equipment, and several members of the BFRO have spent time with this individual in the field. Of particular interest to me is a recording of two consecutive moaning howls. This sounds incredibly similar to the 1994 \"Ohio Howl\" recording. This sustained moaning howl is one of the most commonly reported sounds related to sasquatches. I have heard this call myself several times in a few different places as far flung as Northeast Georgia and the Olympic Peninsula of Washington.I personally think that the moaning howls that the submitter recorded that night were being generated by a sasquatch.12:05 AM - Moaning Howls",

I was approx. one mile from the Stafford Creek Correctional Facility, on a long straight uphill  stretch of the road.  The lights of the prison turnoff were backlighting the crest of the hill.  There were no other cars of the road.  The road is a two lane road, with wide shoulders that could easily be additional lane width, so in essence the road is 4 lanes wide. I could easily see the road due to the backlighting and my headlights and foglights on my car.",
