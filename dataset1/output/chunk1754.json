As I came around the curb, I slowed down to pass this \"person\" and thought, \"Good Lord this is a big person.\"  The creature/person was so tall, That the hands and lower arm were at my passenger side car window.  (I drove a Nissan Cube.)  Since I had slowed down and moved over, I looked back and this creature/person, had crossed the road behind me and was already over a 4 foot fence and moving quickly through the field on the drivers side.",
