            "Observed.1  ": "Here is the original sketch of the creature witnessed on May 29, 2012, drawn by one of the primary eyewitnesses. The being was tall, dark, and covered ground with amazing speed while walking. A family out egg hunting last spring near their village of Kasigluk came upon an incredible sight \u0096 a large, dark, hairy creature walking upright was heading towards them. They \u0096 two teenaged brothers and their mom - were on the outskirts of the village riding their 4-wheeler when they saw it. It was approximately around 3pm, and the weather was beautiful, although slightly cloudy. School was out for the summer and the date was May 29th, 2012. Could it have been the elusive Bigfoot? \u0093We came across it by the lagoon here in Kasigluk,\u0094 said one the eyewitnesses. \u0093It was back there southeast of Fox Lake.\u0094 While they were out that day, the three family members saw other people who coming home from egg hunting. So at first they thought the creature was a person. \u0093After it passed, we looked at each other and thought, \u0091we just saw Bigfoot\u0092,\u0094 the eyewitness said. The creature was very tall and dark. Its long arms hung below its knees. It was approximately 75 yards away. The family watched it for about 2 minutes. \u0093It was walking towards us and then once it saw us it turned and started going to the other side of the hill,\u0094 said the witness. When it disappeared into the bushes, the family headed towards where they last saw it but it was nowhere to be seen. They didn\u0092t hear about anyone else seeing the mysterious creature. The following is the firsthand account about the sighting written by the mother of the two boys, one of the eyewitnesses. \u0093I wanted to go egg hunting, but didn\u0092t want to go alone so I had my two sons follow me since I didn\u0092t want to go alone. My oldest son said he knew of a place where we could go check so off we went towards the lagoon where there is flat land to the east. \u0093Upon reaching the lagoon my older son got off the four wheeler and ran off to see if anybody was in that area. He ran to the edge of the hill and soon ran back saying that somebody was already there. So we decided to go check somewhere else when that \u0093somebody\u0094 started running at an incredible amount of speed. No human person would have gone from down there by that flat land to already towards us up the hill. \u0093That \u0093somebody\u0094 was all black from top to bottom, kind of hunchbacked, like it had no neck and its head was cone-shaped. Its long arms went past its knees and it was incredibly tall. \u0093At first we all asked each other, \u0093Who is that?\u0094 Then after about 10 seconds as it was walking with long strides it would occasionally look towards us. The way it walked was fast and no human could cover that amount of tundra in the same amount of time. I asked, \u0093WHAT is that?\u0094 \u0093All that time we were awestruck and dumbfounded to what we were witnessing. Then as it was going to disappear from our view finally I said, \u0093I think we just saw Bigfoot!\u0094 As it passed in our full view it had covered the whole entire hill in a matter of about a minute. It seemed to be just walking but with big strides. \u0093We went up to the top of the hill but we didn\u0092t see it anywhere so we went straight home feeling kind of excited. \u0093That\u0092s my account. It looked exactly like the Patterson footage of Bigfoot if you\u0092ve ever seen it.\u0094 Big Foot or Hairy Man sightings are not unheard of in the Yukon Kuskokwim delta region. Last summer there were reports of a number of sightings in the Johnson River area and other locations.",

            "Observed.1  ": "There's a declaration that'll have friends turning away and snickering into their hands. Here in the Great Lakes State, as in most of the northland, if it hasn't been shot and dragged by the foot back into town for all to see, it's considered not quite real. But sightings of Bigfoot persist to this day. Just last year, a hunter in Oscoda County got a whiff of something stinky, then came upon a sleeping Bigfoot. Jeez-o-Pete! One was seen in Arenac County in 2003, another in Ogemaw in 2007 near Lupton. The reports keep trickling in, stoking the legend of Bigfoot. For fear of ridicule, few people are willing to make those claims publicly. Who's to say, though, that there isn't a 7- or 8-foot, apelike creature hiding out in our remote swamps? A team of researchers tried to flush one out in the Upper Peninsula in recent years, to no avail. Kind of like those cable TV \"reality\" shows where they never manage to find a live specimen of the creature of the week. That's OK. If Bigfoot were common, they wouldn't be legend, would they? Keep that in mind the next time you're deep in the woods and you see, smell or hear something that's Not. Quite. Right. Could it be Bigfoot? Maybe.",
