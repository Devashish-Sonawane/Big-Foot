As he drove around a corner about 2am his lights shined briefly on a biped a few yards off the highway. The animal was in a stance as if ready to dash across the road from right to left. The witness saw white reflections at what he figured was eye level of the animal but perhaps just catching the eyes at an angle.  He described the hair as light brown, similar to the surrounding sand and granite boulders. The animal appeared to be looking across the road and not at the vehicle.This witness is 6' 1\" tall and he believes the animal was much bigger than himself and taller than the top of his truck.",

All my husband and I could think was that whatever animal this was perhaps the storm confused it or forced it looking for food.  Maybe it wandered into our area because all the lights were out (and I mean every light was out, even the RR track lights weren't working).  So we would have heard it the next evening when the power was back on.  It seemed alarmed/disturbed by all the dogs barking (at it presumably) and almost seemed like it was \"responding\" to the dogs in a way?  All in all I think the storm and subsequent outage is key to this event.",

My husband heard \"someone\" screaming \"bizarrely\", very loud far off across our lake, so he opened our back sliding door to get a better listen.  That was when we both heard a, maybe 3 at a time, organized pattern of what can only be described as roaring screams. We knew immediately they were not human.   I had heard the Klamath audio before and this made my hair stand on end because it was exactly the same.  This animal was closer, just across a 6 acre or so lake/pond. We heard probably a total of 4, 3-at-a-time, scream patterns. The individual screams were alarmed, but not frantic.  It seemed to be almost 'responding' to dogs barking.  The 'runs' were all about .5 - 1 second apart.  The interval in between patterns was probably 1 minute or so. All was quiet for about 3 minutes and somewhere in the dark across the lake we heard something very, very large and strong tussle successfully with a dog. At the end of the tussle the dog let out a sharp yelp and we heard a thud.  At that point we (I flipped out) shut the door, locked all the doors, sawed a serious dowel for our back slider, turned on our kids white noise machines and went to listen from another part of the house.  We heard a few more screams but it sounded farther away at this point and then seemed to go away.",
