            "Follow-Up Report": "The reporter's mother initially noticed the animal as their dog was out running. She first noticed something against a nearby tree that appeared to have gray-black hair and it caught her attention because it appeared to be swaying. The reporter said from what she remembered, the tree was likely a mature water oak that was approximately two and one half to three feet wide. Her mother asked her to look at what she was seeing. When she did, she realized she was looking at something she\u0092d never seen before and her hair stood up all over. She then loaded her mother and dog into the car and they drove away. They drove approximately one mile before stopping to let the dog get out and finish exercising. Their speed was no greater than  50 M. P. H..  This time, within five minutes of stopping, both the reporter and her mother were positive they heard bipedal footsteps approaching them from the direction they had just come from, so they got the dog back into the car and drove away again. This time they drove for approximately two miles before stopping. Once again, they stopped and let  the dog out of the car, and they again heard bipedal footsteps, except this time something was running towards them. This time not only did she and her mother hear it, but the dog did as well. The dog appeared to be very frightened and  immediately tried to get back into the vehicle and upon doing so,  ran head first into the passenger side door of the vehicle. The reporter said the animal was originally sighted on the driver's side of the car, but the noise was heard approaching from the passenger side of the car both times.Note two other reports from adjacent counties/parishes:Report #1498Report #1341",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness, Jonathan, by  phone, the following details can be added to this report:Since he didn\u0092t have a cell signal inside, Jonathan was outside using his cell phone for a conference call.He had made the call at about 10:00 P.M. and estimates it was about two hours later (12:00 A.M) that the incident began. As Jonathan was facing west looking across the moonlit field, he caught a glimpse of something moving from his right to left, or north to south, which he initially believed to be a human. He then noticed another sizeable shape accompanying the figure, and assumed it to be a large animal until it stood up on two legs. The smaller figure remained facing in a southerly direction, bending over repeatedly to apparently pick things up (there is an abundance of blackberry bushes in the area). Jonathan then saw the larger figure crouch down in the tall grass about 150 feet away, all the while facing him. He also lost sight of the smaller one at this point. Jonathan continued to watch the area for several minutes until the large figure stood again, followed by the smaller one. At this point, the larger one reached over to grab (as if to lead) the smaller one as they began to move away towards some trees and an abandoned house to the southwest. Jonathan\u0092s sighting ended as they entered the darkness but  he remained outside for another thirty minutes or so in hopes of seeing them again. He places the total time of the sighting at around ten minutes.In describing the figures\u0092 physical characteristics and movements , Jonathan provided these observations:- The larger of the two was always watching Jonathan and appeared to have its entire torso turned in his direction even when its path was perpendicular to him.- Walked in a steady, unhurried manner with a slight \u0093bounce.\u0094 Strides were long and smooth.- Its arms swung as it walked but never lifted. The hands appeared to hang at knee level or slightly lower.- Color appeared to be very dark or black with shoulder length hair on the head.- Height is estimated at between seven and eight feet, based on comparisons to the trees he witnessed it standing in front of.- Shoulders were very broad and body was massive, much larger than any human.- The smaller one was probably between four and five feet in height when compared to the larger figure.- It had a much slighter build and seemed to be gray in color.- During the sighting, the smaller figure seemed completely uninterested in Jonathan and only concerned with whatever it appeared to be picking up.There was no sound or smell that Jonathan could detect, possibly due to a breeze from the south. Though very afraid, Jonathan never felt threatened or that he would be approached. He was also unable to determine the gender of either.About five minutes after the figures disappeared, Jonathan noticed that his neighbor had stepped outside, then walked around his trailer - this being in the general direction the figures were headed. Several days later Jonathan was talking to this man regarding their shared well and mentioned seeing him come out. His neighbor explained that one of their three daughters had come running from her bedroom to tell he and his wife that someone was \u0093laughing weirdly\u0094 outside her window so he had gone to check it out. He didn\u0092t see or hear anything. ",
