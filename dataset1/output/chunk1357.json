            "Observed": "On the first weekend of summer, 1999, two of my sons and a friend planned a Saturday night bonfire in our backyard fire pit to celebrate the end of the school year. They went out about midnight and started a wood fire to throw their books and papers into. After the fire was going, they began to throw the school stuff into the fire. The firepit is almost visible from the couch I was sitting on in the family room on the southwest side of the house. I fell asleep about 12:30 or so, and was awakened by the slam of the bathroom door at about 1:30 AM. I asked the boys what was wrong, and my younger son and his friend were crying. The oldest son was white faced and visibly shaken. They apparently heard what sounded like women screaming at the back of our yard, to the west, then north, then east, like the screamers were surrounding our yard and taking turns making the screams. The boys said that the screams sounded like they started high pitched, then descended into a low growl and were moving.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with one of the witnesses, now a young man, and his father by phone for a good length of time and have the following information to add to the report.  The witness explained the vocalizations were heard coming from the cornfield immediately after there had been a large flare-up of the bonfire.  The witness could not see anything from the direction of the noise since it was dark and there were trees also obstructing the view.  The witness described the screams as sounding like an unnatural chimpanzee's scream, but with great volume.  When asked if it was similar to that of a raccoon's high pitched snarl, the witness replied no, and that he has heard that particular raccoon sound before.  There were a number of screams and enough to send the boys running into the house before they heard the end of them.The father expressed that the vocalizations had a profound effect on his sons.  The father also added that there had been unusual incidents that had occurred while living at that location.  There was a huge log in the backyard that would, on occasion, get moved from one location to another.  The log was of such size that it would take at least three men to move it.  On other occasions, the household garbage dumpster was found in the corn field adjacent to the house, with the contents (plastic kitchen bags full of garbage) neatly piled next to it, with nothing having been strewn around, but obviously rummaged through.The residence is located on the side of a small group of houses off of a rural road.  A large farm field, usually planted with corn, is adjacent to the house and is separated by a thin line of various trees and bushes along the property line.  The corn was estimated at being 3 feet tall at the time of the incident.  ",
