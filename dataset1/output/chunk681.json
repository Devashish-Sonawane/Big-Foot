This lake is desolate and deserted except for a boat ramp and another man's cabin, on the northeast side of the lake.  It was almost dusk, and G.B., and two other friends were 20-30 feet from shore.  They rounded a 10-15 protruding point, half the distance to the south end of the lake to the boat ramp, when they heard a low, growling sound that would increase to a shriek.  Then G.B. and his companions heard a \"crunch, crunch, crunch\" sound through the woods and up a steep bank, thirty feet up, preceded by another vocalization just like the first.  The interval between the two howls was between five and ten seconds.  The sound of the vocalization had a deep reverberating quality, as well.  The end of the lake where these cries were heard is trailess.",
