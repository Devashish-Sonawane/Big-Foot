As I was approaching the Levee I caught a glimpse of something to my left it was about 200 yards away. I stopped behind a tree and peeked out to have a good look. On the edge of the levee was a creature that appeared to be about 6ft tall. It had shaggy dark brown hair and was walking upright. The creature was walking directly towards me. I was still watching the creature when it was about a 100 yards away. I wasnt scared at all because My shotgun was fully loaded.",
