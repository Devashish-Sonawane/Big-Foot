            "Observed": "It was about 2 a.m. on or about May 3rd 2011, I heard a noise as if something fell that was heavy, a thud sound in the back of my house. I thought it might be a bear or burglar. Me and my 21 year old son went out to investigate. I was armed with a pistol and my son had a shotgun. I saw a deer run as if it was being chased. Then I saw a huge figure coming out of the woods. This thing was at least 8 feet tall. I could not believe this! I screamed out to this thing to stop. It came towards us running. I told my son to shoot. He shot in its direction. It then ran to my left flank and continued to come toward us. We ran back towards the house. I was in terror because the thing was shaped like a man but was covered with hair. I do not believe in Bigfoot but I cannot explain this? I stopped and watched it walk away into the light and it was huge and there was an odor that really stunk in the air. It stayed in sight for about 5 minutes before it went into the woods. I investigated the next day and there are footprints that are about 18 to 20 inches in the field. Unless this is a hoax and someone was in a costume? We fired on this thing and it made a huffing noise and a shriek sound.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "For over two years Mr. T, an admitted bigfoot skeptic, believed a prowler was visiting his farm at night and causing trouble. In earnest Mr. T set out to find the person, but after months of trying he could never catch a glimpse of who was pounding on the walls of his home or throwing rocks at his family. He did however manage to track large bipedal steps through dew and tall grass on a number of occasions. And frequently those tracks would take a circuitous route away from this house, and past a bamboo grove before entering the forest.On the night of his encounter, Mr. T and his eldest son went into the backyard to confront a suspected prowler. Once there, a deer ran toward the witness, from the forested edge of a soy bean field, about 50 yards wide. Mr. T was surprised that a deer actually ran toward he and his son, who was standing 40 feet to his right.After the deer passed by, Mr. T spotted a large, shadowy figure standing at the forest edge. The figure began moving quickly toward Mr. T but to his left where a clearing gave access to another soybean field. At this point Mr. T grew panicked and ordered his son to fire his shotgun.Mr. T's son confirms that he fired his shotgun, but high and in the direction of the wood line. He said it was too dark to see well, but he did clearly hear the sound of running feet approaching. He described the sound as loud and as heavy as if a horse were running toward them.After the gun shot, Mr. T reports the creature veered to its left, and directly toward him. It drew rapidly closer and stopped just 15 feet short of where Mr. T stood. In the seconds before Mr. T turned and ran back into his house, he saw a massive creature, four feet wide, that dropped from two legs to a three-point crouch, placing one hand on the ground. And while it was too dark to make out details of the face, Mr. T felt he could see well enough to discern a surprised look on the animal's face as it looked at him, panting heavily.Mr. T did not fire his weapon but instead turned and ran as fast as he could back around his house and in through the front door. His son was immediately behind him. Upon speaking with his wife, Mrs. T later conveyed that Mr. T's face was blanched white with a look of terror and for some time he was unable to verbalize clearly. When he had calmed enough to tell her what he'd seen, he could only describe it as a big hairy demon. Immediately afterward Mr. T went to his back porch and observed the creature still in the vicinity, but farther away and moving along the wood line toward a street light. It eventually entered the woods and was lost to view.Mr. T reached out to the BFRO and after several lengthy conversations and a visit to his farm, a number of other incidents were uncovered which suggest a sasquatch has been visiting Mr. T's farm for most of the last five years. Common occurrences include loud slaps on the side of his home during the night. Large objects, like riding lawn mowers or trailers in his yard, mysteriously relocating overnight. Loud choruses of wailing howls that break out in remote forests around his farm, occasionally waking his family from sleep. In one instance a young daughter in the family reported seeing a large, hairy man outside the window, a claim Mr. T did not take seriously at the time. And in a separate incident Mr. T came home to find the upper window onto his back porch smashed in, and a bag of garbage stored there had gone missing. Some time after this, the door onto the back porch was ripped apart, and more trash bags were stolen from the porch.On another occasion Mr. T. and his son were in their front yard when rocks were thrown at them from the woods behind their house. Several rocks landed before his son began to pick the rocks up and throw them back. Mr. T notes his son's rocks fell well short of the tree line, which was over 100 yards away. But after he and his son threw a few rocks back, more rocks came from the forest, only much more rapidly than before. Mr. T and his son were forced to retreat into their home. Since then, they have occasionally heard rocks hitting the roof of their home, during the night.Mr. T is an admitted night owl and frequently up to the small hours of the morning. During two evening events, separated by a year's time, Mr. T observed what he thought was a very large Marine, wearing a backpack and ghillie suit, walking along the road in front of his house. On the first occasion Mr. T did nothing, and the \"Marine\" simply disappeared into the darkness. On the second occasion Mr. T yelled to get the subject's attention, whereupon it immediately began to move quickly away, not running, but walking very fast, until it turned and disappeared into the woods along the road.Over the course of several weeks, I held multiple phone conversations with Mr. T and arranged to visit his farm. During this period Mr. T related several stories he had uncovered from locals that involved possible sightings of sasquatch. One instance involved a fox hunter on horse back startling a large hairy animal that ran away on two feet, easily as fast as his own horse could gallop. Another neighbor, a long time resident of the area, admitted to multiple instances of seeing the creature over the course of 25 years. When I contacted the neighbor however, they were not interested in going on the record with their story and did not want to encourage anyone who might come and disturb the creature. A retired sheriff's deputy confided in Mr. T that he had experienced a road crossing while patrolling a mile down the road from Mr. T's farm. Mr. T also has friends in the local Army community stationed at nearby Fort Pickett. And through those connections he is learning of several anecdotal reports involving troops and employees on the fort who have encountered a large bipedal creature. Some reports involve troops in the field on night maneuvers. But one interesting report comes from a civilian cook who was terrified by a close encounter with a tall, hairy creature running quickly past as he exited the rear of the mess hall late at night. The fort's Military Police are said to be aware of the creature, but the term \"bigfoot\" is never used. Instead the locals refer to it as the \"Pickett creature\".While visiting Mr. T's farm, I spent a night camped in the soy bean field 200 yards from his home and adjacent to the bamboo grove he had followed tracks to in the past. During the first night of camping by the bamboo, my overnight audio recorder captured this series of ascending vocals that are highly suggestive of sasquatch activity: ascending vocalsOn the same night, a second recorder placed several miles away, on the edge of the Fort Pickett's training ranges, recorded another series of suspected sasquatch vocals emanating from the deep woods of the ranges.Before departing Mr. T's farm, a long duration audio recorder was left running in the bamboo grove, where it operated for 29 days. On the fourth night of operation, at 2:28 a.m., the recorder captured the sound of bipedal foot steps quickly approaching from the direction of Fort Pickett. In this recording they passed within 20 feet of the recorder before proceeding beyond the bamboo grove and into the woods. (This recording includes the sound of bull frogs from a nearby pond): bipedal foot stepsWhen asked about his encounter, Mr. T believes in hind sight that it was a mistake to fire a weapon around the creature. He feels that it probably meant no harm to him or his family, and that it was attempting to flee the encounter but was frightened, then confused by the gun fire incident. After re-examining years of events with the realization that a sasquatch occasionally visits his farm, Mr. T recognizes that if it meant any harm, it has had ample opportunity to do so.Since this investigation began, Mrs. T has caught a glimpse of a large, hairy creature diving headlong into the wood line near their mailbox. And Mr. T reports that the incidents, while diminished, still occur from time to time. The BFRO will continue to monitor the events at this location and Mr. T is endeavoring to capture video evidence of the creature in the future.Regarding the tunnel next to the creek bed Mr. T described in his report, after close examination I believe it to be a large erosional feature, created by rain water run off.",

            "Observed": "This incident happend in southwest Colorado in early spring/late winter 1989. I worked at the Gladstone mine North of Silverton Colorado and lived in Montrose Colorado. I usually car pooled with another individual at the time and we took turns rotating driving every other day I.E. we took my truck one day and his the next. We did this four days each week for two weeks on day shift and two weeks on swing shift. Anyway to get to the story and sum it up. I  ended up driving to work by myself that particular day because my car pool did not show up in time making me a little late or behind our normal time of leaving.  Whoever was driving in the morning had to be alert and wide awake because of all of the deer and elk along the road and crossing the road that early in the morning. The commute south on 550 from Montrose to the mine took about one and half hours which is about seven miles north and west of Silverton CO.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I discussed this incident with the witness for almost two hours and believe him to be entirely sincere regarding these observations.  He emphasized that he is a lifelong hunter and outdoorsman with much experience in identifying Colorado wildlife and is certain of what he saw. It was an obvious relief to him to have his account taken seriously.A brief flicker of an unusual orangish-red colored eyeshine reflection first caught his attention. The color immediately caught his attention because it was so different from the green color that he always watched -- the eyeshine reflection of deer and elk that were so frequently in the area. This was at a distance of about 150 yards as he approached at about 35 m.p.h. He stated that his lights were set higher than usual and were on bright, giving him an excellent view of the road ahead. No other cars were on the road in either direction in the immediate area at the time. The figure stepped down from the grassy slope into the loose gray shale and soil of the upper reaches of a roadcut. The figure quickly descended the fifty-foot embankment in about five steps and then stepped from the shoulder and across the road to the right shoulder in four \u0093very large\u0094 steps where it paused briefly to turn its entire upper body to look directly at the witness\u0092 vehicle, while fully illuminated in the headlights. The creature then \u0093didn\u0092t just jump\u0094 but carefully \u0093negotiated\u0094 the next step over the edge and out of view down the hillside toward the river and valley bottom. He estimated the duration of the sighting at about six seconds.The witness was able to provide some details concerning its physical description. The creature was \u0093massive\u0094 and, judging from the sign it passed in front of, which he also looked at on his later return, he estimated its height at not less than 9 to 10 feet tall. His estimate as to the weight was 800 pounds. \u0093It was slightly hunched over leaning forward, not standing up straight and tall\u0094 as it walked and its long arms seemed to be about 2/3 of its entire size in length with its hands and fingertips reaching to just above the knee. \u0093It seemed that its legs were shorter than its arms.\u0094  It was entirely dark-colored; dark brown or almost black but with a slightly lighter reddish tinge visible as well. He noticed the swaying of long hair, possibly 6-8 inches on the forearms and the back of the upper arms as it moved. He described the physique as very muscular like that of a bodybuilder. As it turned to look, it seemed that it either could not turn its neck or had no apparent neck. It was \u0093not heavily bearded but did have hair on its face\u0094 and the skin of the face and around the eyes was very dark, almost black. The witness was struck by what he described as a \u0093piercing gaze\u0094 which showed that the creature was \u0093obviously alarmed.\u0094The witness also noted an additional observation from last October just northwest of Rico in Dolores County and approximately twenty miles southwest of his sighting location. While hunting west of Sandstone Mountain above the upper reaches of Horse Creek just under Johnny Bull Mountain. He was startled to hear what sounded like wood-on-wood knocking from about 150 yards away. He reported four distinct knocks at about one per second, but then heard or saw nothing more.David Petti",
