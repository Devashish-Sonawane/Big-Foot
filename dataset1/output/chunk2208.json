The time was estimated to be between 3:00-5:00pm. The witness along with his son saw the figure standing in the middle of the railroad tracks as they crossed the tracks. When they realized that it was not a man or animal that they recognized, they stopped the vehicle to observe. The witness estimates that they watched the figure for five to ten minutes. It was facing them and remained motionless the entire time. He estimates that they observed it at a distance of ~150-200ft. The coloration was described as very light brownish/tan with some red. The hair was fairly long and shaggy. The build was described as \"tall and husky.\" The witness estimates that the figure was over six feet in height, though this is just a rough estimate. He recalls seeing arms hanging down at the sides, but could not see details of the hands or face. The witnesses drove on when another motorist came up behind them. The area on either side of the tracks is heavily forested. There are numerous creeks and ponds in the area along with a lake that is a short distance from this location. The witness is very familiar with the area and the native wildlife. He is aware that bears frequent the location where this sighting took place, but he is certain that what he saw was not a bear. ",

(my wife and I were at the spot the day before and the tree wasn't there..when we went the next morning we seen it in the river) It then landed in the water and stood there, it started towards them and they ran back to our cabin. Before this happened they heard rocks or something being thrown into the water. This occurred about 10-11 at night while the boys were in the river gigging. Which is knee to waist deep. These boys are all boy and spend nights out in tents at the river and woods.. This night they were extremely upset and scared and wouldn't stay in the tent. They wanted to leave that night and come home! I don't know what they seen, but I don't think they are making this up, they were truly scared!!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the young man and his father. Both very familiar with the woods and all animals residing there. In that they are familiar, there is virtually nothing they are afraid of. The young 14 year-old son, relived the events. I will add here, some of what was mentioned in the original report, as well as some following items remembered as he relived the events. The tree pushed over into the river was 20-25 ft. tall. Their attention was drawn to the area of the tree due to some splashing (rocks or objects being thrown into the river). As they shined their flashlights at the area, they saw the creature \"riding the tree down\" as it crashed into the river. (like riding a surfboard). The river was about 40 ft.wide, and the tree covered at least half the width of the river. They then heard something walking or moving in the river. River was about 5.5 to 6ft deep at that point. They shined their small flashlights in the direction of the sound and saw something moving from the base of the tree across the river at a diagonal direction away from them. They saw \"a silhouette and arm swinging movement\" and an upright creature that was blackish (it was dark) moving upstream away from and in front of them. At that point, they left in a big hurry. These are boys who are quite familiar with the woods, and pretty much scared of nothing. They have seen, and been in the presence of bears, and this was not a bear. When they went back the next morning, they saw the tree and there were \"large scratches\" on the tree. As stated in the original report, they had been to the exact spot the day before and the tree was not in the water. ",
