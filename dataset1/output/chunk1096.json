            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the submitter, the son, about the sighting his mother had on their property while deer hunting. It was 1:30 PM. Son was less than a mile away, also hunting, when his Mom saw the creature, and called him, very frightened. She saw it rise up up from a 4 point stance. It appeared to be looking over some tracks on the ground, in the light snow cover, stood, and looked at her. She described it as 600 pounds or more, large head, pointy ears on the side, and much larger than a bear. The creature had fur, and she seemed to have startled it, as she came upon it suddenly and was only 20 yards from it, when it stood up. She was scared, turned and ran to her tree stand and called her son.He arrived, and scouted the area. He saw broken branches, tracks in the snow, and noticed bad smells. He had the eerie feeling of being watched. He has smelled these smells before in the area. His mother said \"I have never seen anything that big before in the woods\".These two are very experienced in the woods.  They have seen bears, wolves and mountain lions.  This was nothing they had ever experienced.  Report #48085 is one of two reports close to this location that I investigated prior. ",

It sounded higher in pitch all most like a child making the sound. A few minuets later I heard it again. Whatever it was was far off. I was hoping to hear a deeper answer but didn't.

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness for 30 minutes.  He seems to be a very experienced hunter and comfortable outdoorsman, and the following details can be added to this report:Regarding the vocalizations:Occurred about 0600 in the morning, and witness heard two calls lasting approximately 2-3 seconds apiece, in short succession (about 3 seconds apart).  He described them as similar to a child's yell, but it sounded far away, and was coming from across the river in Alabama, where the vegetation is thick and there are no inhabitants. It did not sound like any animal he has ever heard, and he denied any similarity to cat cries.  No other out of place observations were made, including smells or tracks.Regarding the \"smelling\":  He estimates this occurred in the same area as the vocalizations, actually about 4-5 years ago. He was bow-hunting from a permanent hunting stand. The odor was described as \"raunchy,\" like a \"room full of dirty gym socks 100 years old.\"  The smell came and went, and as the wind never shifted direction, he believes whatever the smell came from shifted position behind his stand, where a creek bed was.  He did look for tracks the next day, but the rocky creek bed yielded no tracks.Regarding his cousin's experience:  His cousin had been hunting since a very young age and was very confident in the woods prior to his experience, which occurred at age 16 (about 14 years ago).  He was alone hunting in this same area, and apparently heard an extremely load \"roar\" at fairly close range, like nothing he had heard before.  It was his opinion that he was being \u0093told to leave\u0094 by the roar.  The incident shook him to the point he will not go into the woods after dark to this day.  Additionally, the witness relates second hand that this same cousin had a sighting a few years later at age 18 or 19 on a road a few miles to the west in nearby Walton county.  While driving alone late at night the cousin spotted what he initially thought was a \"large man with a fur coat on,\" standing in the road. The hair covered creature wandered off after a few seconds down a small trail into the woods. The cousin had to stop on the road to avoid hitting the creature. Additional experiences noted: The witness relates a few occasions during hunting when he has followed the blood trail of a deer he has shot, only to have the trail suddenly disappear with no trace of the deer in the surrounding area.  He had expected to find the deer, as he thought his shot was good for the kill.  The last of these incidents occurred in the same area of his vocalization encounter.   The witness also relates approaching a pond in the same area of the property last year, and hearing \u0093something big\u0094 exiting the pond, but he retreatted from the area before arriving at the pond as he did not feel comfortable encountering whatever caused the noise.",
