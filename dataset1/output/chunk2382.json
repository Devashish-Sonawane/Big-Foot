            "Observed": "I was 14 years old in 1976. It was either Nov or Dec 1976 and I had rode my dirt bike to what is known in Cooke County, Texas as the Old Toll Bridge located at the Red River. At the river stands 3 old piers that supported the bridge back in the 20's or 30's. I was standing by the edge of the river looking at the ice float by when I heard what sounded like to me as Coon dogs hot on the trail of something across the river on the Oklahoma side. As I looked across I saw a dark hairy animal, or something, running on two legs like a human. There was a dead tree log that this large animal jumped over. The coon dogs jumped across the log after it. As I watched in amazement I heard the lead dog let out a loud yelp. The 2nd dog came running back and jumped over the log back into the direction that they originally came from. The first dog never came back nor made another sound. At 14 years old it scared the hell out of me so I ran and jumped on my motorcycle and took off home. I told everyone at the house of what I saw and everyone laughed at me. I hade been back there several times after that but never seen or heard anything. The Old Toll Bridge Road is now closed off. I know what I saw and it wasn't human nor a bear. It was a Big Foot.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "There seems to be a pattern of bigfoot sightings between Grayson County and Cooke County along the Red River. Also, north of the River in Love and Marshall Counties the same has been occurring for quite some time. The pattern seems to start East of Hwy 35 and extends into the Lake Texoma region. Some of this area is remote, and near the river there has been good hunting and fishing areas for sportsmen. The witness of this account seemed sincere in his statements. He said, \u0093I can close my eyes and see it today as though it just happened yesterday.\u0094 There was no doubt in his mind as to what he saw. The witness claims the animal was about 150 yards or so away, and he saw it for only two or three seconds, but he was sure it was not human. He said the size could have been 10 ft. tall, it was that large. Also the footprint that was later found was reported to be at least a size 14 of 15 if compared to a human shoe size. This old bridge was reported to be a haunt of bigfoot according to local legend. It is no longer there, and the old road does not cross the river. It does seem, however, that the woods north of Gainesville, up to Walnut Bend and Callisburg, and extending up into the woods and river bottoms in Love and Marshall Counties, Oklahoma may be a temporary, if not permanent haunt of a large, yet undiscovered primate.

            "Observed": "Last year during archery season my 12year old son and I were elk hunting off Rampart Range road between forest rd 322 and Mt Herman rd and herd strange noises. I am an avid archery hunter and have hunted all typs of animals all my life and what we herd that night still sends shivers down my spine. I do alot of calling for myself and friends for elk so I am familiar with alot of noises in the woods, we had seen elk in the aera the week prior to this incident. We drove in to the end of a trail off 322 and parked the car it was getting late and having my son with me I decided to just go to the end of the trail that overlooked 3 beaver ponds and try calling. We got to where we could see the ponds and sat down to wait a few minutes and listen for bugling elk. After hearing nothing for a few minutes I decided to call, when I bugeled from the ridge opposit us we herd what seemed like part elk, part cat, whining, but it sounded like there was 20 or 30 animals on the ridge across from us all making this moening/whining type noise. It lasted about 15 seconds. I wasent sure what I had just heard so I bugeled again we heard the same noise again. I didn't recignize the noise and the hair on the back of my neck was standing up so I decided to leave. I also heard water splashing, it was getting dark and I looked all over the beaver pond through binos and could see nothing moving so we left. There is very few animal noises in the forrest that I do not recignize much less make me nervous but those noises we heard that night I will never forget.",
