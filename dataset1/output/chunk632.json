            "Observed": "My 15 year old cousin and I were walking in a medow below the ranch cook house. It was late october and the other ranch hands had left for the season, leaving my cousin and I to close up the ranch for the winter, there where no other people around the area. The summer backpackers had all gone. It was around dusk when we heard a noise, it started out as a low rumble, we almost felt it before we heard it.  But it then rose in volume and pich. it was like a babbling scream. It could almost sound like words, the screem lasted at least 30 seconds or more then rose to a shreak and ended abruptly.  It sounded as though it came from a point 50 or so yards from where we were standing, a thick grove of trees and deadfalls we call the island.  I could hear something moving in the trees and starting to circle the meadow we were in. IT screamed again and sounded as though it had moved to our right.  My cousin and I were shaken by the noise and we ran for the cook house. Sitting inside we heard it again and it sounded as  though it was now in the medow below us, but the darkness made it imposible to see anything. At this time we moved from the cooks cabin to a building we call the winter room.  We locked the door and spent the night there ( the room is bear proof and therefore safe). We heard it maybe five more times, around the ranch and once I was woken up at maybe three in the morning, by something outside our room. The next day I searched for tracks but the ground was frozen though it hadn't snowed yet. We found no tracks, but there was a hand print on the door of a store room where we keep food from bears during the summer.  The print of the palm was nearly as big as both my palms put together, and the fingers where as big as three of mine in length (this thing had long fingers).  The print was upside down near the bottom of the door as though it was trying to pry the door open from the bottom. (the print was still partily there next summer, At the time it seemed oily).  I am twenty three. I have been backpacking and camping since I was five.  I have grown up in the mountins and on the Ranch, I have heard mountin lions on more than one occassion, I have also heard a wounded bear screem (someone had shot it). The noise that my cousin and I heard was unlike any thing I have heard Ever. We call it the Yargle thing, and joke about it after the fact, but at the time it really scared us. (I don't scare easily we mountain men are from tough stock). I have heard and seen nothing since. This happend winter of 99.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness by phone and the following details can be added to the report:--Sound was indescribable, but sounded like the sounds from the Sierra bigfoot recording.--Doesn't think the creature was there for their trash since they ship it out by car and burn the rest.--No one else at the ranch has had any other experiences.--Has heard of other stories of sightings from the Sally Key Lakes and Ward Mt. Lakes areas.",

            "Observed": "There were six of us camping up on the Mt Jupiter Road in between the Dosewallups and the Duckabush rivers on labor day weekend, on saturday morning about 4:00am Ken heard a loud roar, just over the hill and down at the creek bed 500 yards from camp. on Saturday night their were six of us around the camp fire and heard the same roar as from Saturday morning, I told everybody that vocalization is from bigfoot, so we stayed up for a while longer and went to sleep in our tents at about 10:30pm. We heard the vocalizations again at about 11:00 pm Saturday night and this went on for about 45 minutes, then again at about 4:30 am for about 10 minutes. The vocalizations were so powerful that it seemed like they were about a 100 yards away but it was probably 500 yards away but it was loud and clear, then did not hear anything on Sunday night. When I heard the first vocalization the hair on my neck stood up and I got my hunting pistol ready for action, for fear it would come into our camp. The bank is too steep to try to collect foot prints or pursue the creature. I have hunted all over Washington state in the past 30 years and never in my life have I heard a vocalization like that before. When it happened I knew darn well what it was its bigfoot.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length over the telephone.  The group was camping on private land on Mt. Jupiter, a ridge in the eastern foothills of the Olympic Mountains, between the Dosewallips River (to the north) and the Duckabush River (to the south).  Both rivers run east into Hood Canal, a branch of Puget Sound.  They heard several series of roars which began 1) early Saturday about 4:00 AM, 2) Saturday night about 9:30 PM, 3) Saturday night about 11:00 PM which lasted 45 minutes, and 4) Sunday morning about 4:30 AM which lasted 10 minutes. Though a hunter, when the witness heard the first vocalization he was afraid to get out of his tent, and got his hunting pistol ready in case of attack.  Another friend who camped in the same spot earlier also heard vocalizations about 4:30 AM Friday morning.  The witness estimates that the animal was about 500 yards away, though if the listener didn't take the loud volume into account, it could have sounded as close as 100 yards.  At the first vocalization Saturday night, a golden retriever dog cowered by the campfire, showing obvious fright.Though the group has camped at the same campsite 3 to 4 times a year for 25 years, this is the first time they have heard sounds like these.The location is in a \"hotspot\" for Bigfoot activity.  There are several other reports from the area in the BFRO database.  Three of the closest are report #5299 from near the Dosewallips River, report #40378 from near the Duckabush River, and report #25462 from the same ridge as this report (Mt. Jupiter).  Reports of Sasquatch sightings, sounds, and other signs are widespread around the edges on all sides of the Olympic Mountains, where the river valleys support populations of salmon and steelhead, elk, deer, other animals which are potential food, and a wide variety of plants.  There is plentiful water (this is \"rain forest\" or nearly so, depending on the specific location), thick cover, and rugged terrain which is difficult for humans to penetrate.Due to the location, the repetition and duration of the calls, their volume and the fear they caused, it seems very likely that the group heard one or more Sasquatch over the 2-day period.",
