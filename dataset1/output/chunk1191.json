            "Observed": "Early on the morning of 10/13/2015 while driving through North Carolina I saw the unexplainable and it blew me away. At approximately 12:30am I was driving south on I95 near exit 2 or 3 just a few miles from the South Carolina border with a tractor trailer approximately 400-500 yards in front of me. I had been following this truck for awhile when it looked like something had either been hit by the truck, kicked up or maybe a deer crossed behind the truck. In quick order, first the right taillight then the reflective material in the middle then the left tail light went dark and came back on. Instantly I cancelled the cruise control, steered my vehicle to straddle the center line thinking I would either have to avoid some debris in the road or avoid a deer that could be standing in the road and leaned towards the windshield to get a better look. As I approached the spot where this happened there was nothing in the road, but standing on the median side of the road was for lack of better understanding a Bigfoot! It was hairy from head to toe and huge. At least 7' tall. As I got closer it took two huge steps and went down the side of the embankment into the median. I was literally no more then 10-15' away from it when passing it. I was able to hit the high beams as it took the second step. This entire scenario played out in probably 10 seconds or so.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness via phone on 11/8/15.  The witness stated that around 12:20 am while traveling south on I 95 he was approximately 400 yards behind a tractor trailer truck when he noticed something block the tail lights and reflectors on the rear of the truck traveling from right to left.  He assumed that a deer had crossed the road in front of him so he slowed down, straddled the center lines, and cut on his brights as to prepare to avoid a collision with a deer.  As he approached the location where he saw something cross the road standing in the median was a large hairy creature.  The creature took two large steps toward the center of the median in the direction of the north bound lane.  The witness did not see the face.  He said the head had no snout and was not shaped like a bear. He described the hair as blackish brown and molded looking like clay, not shaggy.  It had an extremely large chest and head with long arms.  It walked with its right leg first then its left leg. The creature walked in a fluid motion with great speed. He knew instantly that it was no bear. The witness estimated the height at about 7ft tall (the witness himself is 6ft 4 inches and 240lbs).  The encounter lasted for about 10 to 12 seconds.  He was so shaken by what he saw, that he stopped at the closest rest stop and tried to wrap his head around what he had seen and went to sleep.  The next morning he had to get it off his chest so called his wife to tell her about what he had seen earlier in the morning and continued his commute back home to Florida.  The witness explained that he grew up hunting and had never given any credibility before about the existence of Sasquatch, but in the moment that he saw the creature he knew without a shadow of a doubt that they were real.  At the time of his encounter Eastern North Carolina was experiencing heavy rains and he believes the rain had maybe flushed the creature out of a swamp.  He stated that he filed his report because he wants people to know about what he witnessed and that they are real. Robeson County boasts plentiful wildlife and large tracks of agricultural land.  There are also many local legends of Bigfoot like creatures in the area. ",

            "Observed": "Me and my fishing buddy went camping at French Meadows reservoir to get in the last days of the season.  In the campground we were alone and everything was shut down, nighttime temps were 32 and 29 the second night.  We were in the last campground on a dirt road a mile east of the lake.  Very few hunters were in the area because it\u0092s a game refuge and no other fishermen were in the area.  We got in camp around 9pm because the fishing was great and it took time to clean our fish.  As soon as we got there i gave out my whoop whoop whoop whoop, hoping to hear a return call.  This went on every hour and my buddy all the while half cracking up looking at me like I\u0092m nuts. At 1am my buddy was asleep in the sack [his Cherokee].  At 1:30am, I let out my last calls, you could here the echoes for 3 to 4 second's afterward.  10 second's after my call I got a woooraa back.  I was shocked to get my first return call ever, it sounded to be a good 300 to 500 yards out and with a two D-cell flashlight, Ii was not going to investigate.  The direction the sound came from there were no roads or camps.  I knocked on my buddy\u0092s car and got him up hoping he had heard it but all he said he heard was me.  From now on I will take a recorder.  I\u0092ve been hunting fishing and hiking all my life and that was the only time I heard this sound. It was not a coyote, a cat or an owl [I know them well].  In my heart I believe it was either a person or a bigfoot.  The remote area from which the sound came from tends to make me believe the latter.",
