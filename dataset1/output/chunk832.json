We just passed the agriculture inspection station in the town of Meyers, CA, when both my wife and I saw simultaneously a large animal crossing the road about 100 yards in front of us.  I thought it was a bear but wasn't sure.  So I asked my wife.  Her response was most unusual. She said that she saw it walking on two legs and that it looked like a monkey, about 5 1/2 feet tall, with light brown fur.  She has better eye sight than me so I questioned her further.  \"What else did you notice,\" I asked, very curious.  She said that it had walked rather slowly, across the road, and that it was definately an animal, like a monkey, and walked like a monkey would walk.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness by phone.  The following details can be added to the report:--Location was just west of the Agriculture Inspection Station.--Since it was a Sunday night, there weren\u0092t any other cars on the road.  The Bigfoot crossed at an obvious gap between traffic--They were returning from a weekend at Fallen Leaf Lake.--Witness thought it was a bear at first, but his wife\u0092s description made him realize it was something else.--They saw the creature in their headlights, from about 75 yards away.--Wife saw an animal that was fully bipedal, heavy set, and obviously a \u0093monkey\u0094 with light brown hair (not fur).--Wife is good at estimating height, and estimated it as being slightly taller than her, so around 5\u00926\u0094.--She did not see any gender or facial features.--Creature was already in the middle of the road when they saw it.  It had a slow, casual gait and was in no hurry to cross the road.  The creature did not turn to look at them, indicating that it was not alarmed by the presence of the car.--The creature headed up the Truckee River after it crossed the road.--The couple were already headed up Highway 50 when they realized what they had seen and unable to turn around.--After the witness related his story at work, a fellow employee mentioned a sighting in the Squaw Valley area.Additional follow-up:  Researcher Kathy Moskowitz was at this location that same night and arrived in the area at 10:15 p.m.  She and her team heard the calls of a bigfoot and followed the calls upstream.  If anyone saw or heard anything in that area around this date, please contact her at Kathy_M@BFRO.net",

He described the night as reasonably foggy, where if he were to use his vehicle headlights on bright, the glare would inhibit vision of the road. He said that because of the fact he was driving a new car, and knew the road to contain numerous deer, he was doing less than the speed limit until approaching and catching sight of the subject, where he slowed down dramatically to less than 15 mph. He described the hair color as a dark, dirty brown. The witness was clear and lucid regarding the encounter, and was relaxed during our conversation. During the interview I felt that his description was indeed an account of an experience he had two years prior. He told me that after this event, he discussed the sighting with family members and learned that the area was common for this type of night crossing.",
