            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed Joseph, and after thirteen years he is still shaken by his encounter.  Initially he wasn't sure what to make of the incident until recently when he came across \"Finding Bigfoot\" and after talking to people in the area. Besides his son, Joseph was accompanied by his hunting buddies including a law enforcement officer.  Joseph explained that he's an avid outdoorsman and hunter, and has been around big cats and bears before.  He has experience being in deep woods at night tracking deer.  But, this time was different.  This time he felt that he was the prey.  As he made his way to the bottoms the air temperature was warm enough that the water wasn't frozen.  At first he noticed that there wasn't any other animals around; any sounds of birds, no squirrels, nothing at all.  Then he noticed the smell, which he described as a smell so putrid that to this day he still cannot get it out of his head.  It was a very intense odor which hung in the air.  Joseph stated that as a former fireman he's had to remove bodies from burning buildings, and the odor he encountered in the bottoms was more overpowering and putrid.  It was like rotten meat and wet dog but really overpowering.As he started looking around for the source of the odor he had the sense that he was being hunted, which unnerved him to the point that he decided it was time to leave the area.  On the way out he felt as if he was being escorted out by some thing, but all he could hear was his own heart.  He raced out of the bottoms with his sidearm and rifle loaded and the safeties off.  Upon returning to the road, his son told him that he looked like death warmed over.  It was only about 10:30 am or so, and he was done for the day.Located in far north central Wisconsin, Oneida County has a total area of 1,236 square miles (3,201 km\u00b2), of which 1,124 square miles (2,912 km\u00b2) is land and 111 square miles (288 km\u00b2) (9.01%) is water. As of 2010 the population was 35,998. It's heavily forested and is popular with hunters and sportsmen.",

We had park our truck at the top of the hill and walk down the trail to the creek below. We had been fishing about a hour and had no luck when we decided to move upstream. We got our gear together and starting walking up the shoals and heard a large splash hit the water up ahead. We first thought it was a rock that had rolled of the side of the steep terrain when suddenly a large black/brown human like creature was slashing at the water with it's long arms. The creature never new we were there and we must have viewed him for 2-3 mins playing around in the water. We never moved only making eye contact with each other. Suddenly it darted off to the right up the steep terrain not knowing whether it had seen us or not. We never got a good look at it's face. It must have been 6-7ft. around 300-400lbs. and look very healthly. We were around 25-30yds from it. We kept this to ourselves for quite a while only shareing it with family members . We have returned to the area several times and have never seen it again but have seen unexplained markings when no bear is to be in the area.",
