He said as a small boy he would look out his window at night and see something walking between his family\u0092s barn and their pond. He also told me that he and a friend were followed out of the woods once and never saw what was following them. It would stop when they stopped and run when they would run. I don\u0092t know all the details of his other stories, but he told me that his other family members have had encounters also. From what he told me some of them were pretty close encounters with Bigfoot.",

            "Observed": "In 1988 my wife, fianc\u00e9e at the time, and I were visiting my grandmother who was in her mid eighties at that time. She was living on some property that has been owned by my family for over half a century. She had spent a good portion of her life on this property. It was dusk and we were about to leave so we decided to sit on her porch before leaving. After sitting on the porch and talking for a while we heard a loud AHHHHHHHWW! It was coming from just inside the woods behind her house. I\u0092m pretty familiar with animal sounds, but couldn\u0092t identify this sound. I figured that since my grandmother lived there most of her life she would know what it was. I asked her about the sound and she said that she didn\u0092t know, but she said that she takes all her scraps and garbage to the edge of the woods every evening and lately she had the feeling that she was being watched. She also told me she had started carrying a garden hoe when she went out there.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone 2/26/04. We talked almost two hours and I was impressed with his attention to detail, honesty and forthright answers to my questions. He is woods-wise and has been a hunter most of his life. He is a very credible witness. Location: Approximately 5 miles south of Karnack, Texas off Hwy 43. There is a creek flowing about 1/4 mile south of sighting location. The creek flows into Big Cypress Bayou just before it enters Caddo Lake. Both events he reports happened on the same property. First Event: The long vocalization the he and his fianc\u00e9e heard was about twice as long in duration as the normal panther scream that one occasionally hears around that location. No one living there knew for sure what made the noise. I was impressed that the grandmother carried a garden hoe for protection. That reminded me of my grandmother back in the 50's. She also took a garden hoe for protection from everything from snakes to stray dogs & to irate bulls. Those old gals could do a lot of damage with a garden hoe. Second Event: The witness had been in his deer-hunting stand for approximately an hour, still before sunup but had full moon for illumination. He first thought it was a person since it was walking on two legs. It was walking towards him up the pipeline clearing. As it got nearer, it took on the shape of an animal but not too clear as the only light was the moon. As it closed the distance to about 50 yards, he became concerned and flipped the safety off on his rifle. As he flipped the safety off, the animal heard it, immediately turned slightly to face him and quickly walked backwards for about four steps and quickly turned around and disappeared into the woods. The woods were thick underbrush with mostly young trees about 15 feet tall. One tree was larger at about 20 feet tall and it began to shake violently for about 3 to 4 seconds, then all was quiet. After sunup and when his hunting partner came up, they investigated the area of entering the woods to the tree that had so violently shook. They could find no prints to identify the animal and only small animal trails in the underbrush. The Animal: It was too dark to make out facial features. It was just a large bulky body walking on two feet. It made no noise. It gave off no odor that could be detected from the 50-yard range. Conclusion: I found it interesting that it could hear so well, react so quickly, take the steps backward to the game trail and disappear quickly into the underbrush. I believe these creatures drop to all fours and knuckle walk through the underbrush and game trails that we humans cannot walk through. I feel the violent tree shaking was just a warning to keep away, (it worked). Combine this with the ongoing events of the family who were on this land since the early 1900's and the close proximity of other sightings (within 6 miles) of several other Harrison County sightings. I am sure that he witnessed a Bigfoot. ",
