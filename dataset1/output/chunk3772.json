            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone who was around 12 years-old at the time of his sighting. It took place in the 1977-1978 time frame, in John A. Roebling Park, which is part of the Abbott Marshlands, a freshwater marsh adjoining the Delaware River. The following details can be added:*The figure seen was between 6 and 6 and one half foot tall, but not quite seven feet tall. The witness stated that he knew what a seven foot tall person looked like because he remembered seeing Andre The Giant, who was seven feet, 4 inches tall.*The figure had broad shoulders, a thick neck and a conical head. The figure did not have a V shaped torso. The torso was the same thickness from its shoulders to its waist. The figure was a solid dark brown color, with no breaks at the wrists or at the bottom near the ankles, as to suggest by the witness that it was not a person wearing dark clothing. No facial features were observed. The witness did not find tracks, rather what he described as rub marks, suggesting the being quickly propelled itself off of the trail, away from the area and into the brush.*Since the particular area in question connects back to the Crosswicks Creek and into the Fort Dix pine land area, the witness stated that he theorized many years later that the figure he saw may have traveled from the pine lands to feed off of the shad (a type of fish) who spawn in the Delaware River during the springtime. *The land around the area in question has further been developed since the incident took place, which is almost 40 years ago. Numerous highways have been built, including Routes 295, 29, 130 and a portion of the New Jersey Turnpike. ",
