            "Follow-Up Report": "On July 14th the witness and her husband met with me and Florida Investigator Caroline Curtis. She related to us the same story she detailed in her report and showed us the area mentioned. The witness lives in an area where great care has been made to blend the sub-division into the woodland environment. A large lake is located directly across from her home bordered by virtually impenetrable vegetation consisting of pines, palmetto and vines. The witnesses, (husband and wife) are both highly articulate professionals with backgrounds in science, engineering and mathematics. Behind their home is a medium sized retention area bordered by woodland with a grass buffer. Signs of wildlife particularly whitetail deer are abundant throughout the area. Based upon the witnesses account and other unexplained events behind the house regarding food being taken from a wildlife feeder it was decided to begin audio recording from the rear of the home on a nightly basis and to set a trail camera to capture images of whatever was removing food from the feeder. The investigation continues to this day and although we have not captured a definitive image something has been able to take apples and bananas from the feeder without getting captured on two different game cameras. I have analyzed hours of audio recordings and although a howl has not been heard again, there have been some sounds that appear to be wood knocks and other unidentified noises recorded during the night hours. Activity virtually died off after the passage of Tropical Storm Fay which caused large scale flooding through the woodlands of the Little Econ River forest. The deer have slowly begun to return to the area and recording will again begin if the unexplained events of the past resume. My conclusion is that the animal of our investigations either periodically visits or has migrated through this area and found an easy food source. Items the animal finds very appealing such as apples and bananas. This report is submitted as a Class B with the caveat that the investigation will continue if necessary and the report may be amended or even upgraded in the future. ",

            "Observed": "This was late morning 11:25. I am hunting a thicket facing East. The area I am hunt runs North and South, I am at the far West side sitting on a fenceline.There are 175/200 grazing cattle behind me.A few calves spook as I walk up the fenceline to the split at the base of a willow tree that I sit at most all the time.But the cattle are used to seeing me there, a few seconds pass and they kept grazing. I sat ther all morning waiting on a deer or my brother to show up. As usuall he was late, so I was eating the cookies I packed for him. All of a sudden the cattle behind me and the other part of the herd across the other side of the pasture started stampeding to the center of the pasture. The cattle met in the center of the pasture and continued a thunder like stamped southward. I knew it was not me that starteled them but what.As I turned slowly and looked over my left shoulder I saw something walking on the far west fenceline heading northward. It stopped Twice and looked in my direction.A ice cold feeling shot down to my legs. The 6 strand barbwire fence came to its thigh or butt area. This thing? was about 81/2 to 9 feet tall,solid black,and covered ground in a way I have never seen. I thought if this is a man he would have to be a good jumper, but it did not look like it was in a hurry, just moving on. I was so caught off guard that I did not think to lift my rifle to get a better look, all I could do was just stare with my mouth wide open. My brother shown up about 30 minutes later and I asked him \" HOW DID YOU DO THAT \". He said he just parked his truck and started walking northward where he knew I would be, 11/2 miles north of where I lived. So that eliminated him.",
