            "Follow-Up Report": "I have met with the witness, and have had several conversations with her about her experience.  She reiterated the details of the story to me, and we also drove the route she was taking on the morning of the road crossing.  It is indeed a country road, lined with trees, farmland, and scattered residences with long driveways leading to them.  It's a curvy road, and would've been difficult to see what was around the bend in a few areas.  Its the type of country road that most drivers will slow down before rounding sharp curves, for safety.  The witness, that morning, came around a particular corner, and witnessed a very tall, hairy figure crossing the street, virtually right next to her car.  She actually had to turn the steering wheel and swerve into the left hand lane to avoid colliding with the figure. Her first thought was that this was one of the area residents, possibly taking their trash to the curb, etc.  From where she sat in the driver's seat, she was able to get a clear observation of the animal's arm and a hand, at the same level as her passenger side window. When she re-positioned herself for a better look, the figure turned its head to face away from the headlights and the witness, as if to obscure its face.  The hair is described as dark, and initially, she thought it might be a heavy fur coat.  The apparent height and appearance made her reconsider this, though.  As she passed the area, she could see that the animal had made it over a 4 foot barbed wire fence, and had made rapid distance into a field, vanishing into the darkness.  She continued to use this same route in her morning commute for many months, and couldn't help but watch for another appearance of the tall, hairy figure every time.I find the witness to be credible, and she has been consistent with her account of the sighting every time she has talked about it.  I am appreciative that she chose to tell her story to me, and trust the BFRO to accurately document what she experienced.  The area is well-established as an active area for sasquatch research, as noted in the BFRO reports database entries for Jackson County, MO.Here is a short clip from a video interview that was conducted, while driving in the location of her sighting.",
