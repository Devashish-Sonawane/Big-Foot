            "Observed": "I was 15 years old visiting my grand parents up from Miami Fla, while on a walk through a remote forest section of lake Keowee SC at twilight I saw a very large shape walk up a section from the lake about a 20% incline from left to right across a dirt road and into the dense forest at a higher elevation to the right.  I was approx  50 yards away when it saw me the light was very low but I saw this thing was not human at all, at least 7 to 8 ft tall 450, lbs no neck and reddish in color. I bolted in a panic this thing ran up the hill and started to parrallel the road in which I running I will never forget the scream it let out the cove was like an ampatheater, but it sounded like a cow and a pig being killed on a rock concert sound system. afterwords many people my pastor among many  indicated that this creature had been seen and heard for many years in the area, I am now am a airline captain ex fighter pilot and hold a degree in zooology, one night I was watching monsterquest and heard a bigfoot scream my girlfriend said I turned white and started to shake. this thing is real, no question about it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on several occasions and I find him to be truthful. I went to the location of the sighting and found the area as he described.  Duke Energy flooded the area in the early 70's and many of the Native American trails and villages are now underwater.  This area gained fame during this era by the filming of the movie 'Deliverance' in and around the Lakes Region of Oconee & Pickens Counties. The area still remains fairly sparse, but has upscale homes along the lakefront now.  The witness described the encounter being in a narrow section of land.  I found the narrow section of land and the site of the old mobile home park that once was there.There continues to be reports coming from both sides of the lake and has recently been a flurry of recent sightings, possibly brought on by the TV series \"Finding Bigfoot\" or the encroachment of their land by lake development.Just north of this area is a road called \"Screaming Hollow\" and one across the Lake is known as\"Booger Branch\" which brings to mind the local lore of this area.  My property lies due west of here by a distance of 6 miles.  We have heard the screams as the witness described on numerous occasions.  The are quite unnerving and do sound much like a cow in distress, but lasts much longer and blood curdling.  Some of the recordings are posted on Stan Courtney's website from the upstate area.Many of the local Cherokee legends speak of the Slant Eyed Giant who inhabited these forestlands of western North & South Carolina.  The Cherokee Foothills Trail is in close proximity as well as the vast forest of Sumter National Forest to this report.   I will continue to monitor the area for activity.",
