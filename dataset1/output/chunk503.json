It was at night and something was walking up and down the bank moving undergrowth and staying out of sight of the spot light. He found it very peculiar that the undergrowth was not only being moved at the base but also at the top. The undergrowth stood 8-10 feet tall and some of it was a bamboo type plant. After deciding to leave the area it followed them all the way out of the bayou to a lake. When they got there something large hit or landed in the water. They used the spotlight but saw nothing.",

            "Observed": "It was a few days after hurricane frederic. I was 11 years old at the time. We lived in a trailer on hurricane rd. and my grand parents owned the hurricane landing & fish camp ( what is now perkins landing ). We were left without power after the hurricane so all our food was on ice. It was about 11:00 pm and my dad asked me to walk to my grandparents store and get some ice, so I grabbed a flashlight and took off walking, it was less than a quarter of a mile from our house to the store and I was very used to walking the route on a daily bases. So I'm walking down the left side of the road and I can here the dogs barking and really cuttin up, they belonged to an older man who lived in a little white house down the road on the right. He kept them in a pin behind his house so when I get in front of the house I shine my light across the street at and around the house, suddenly I see something very large run from behind the house on two legs. I followed it with my light as it ran toward the woods, and then it stopped and turned and looked at me. It's eyes glowed red in the dark, and all the sudden it runs straight at me, it was so fast, I mean it traveled about 30 or 40 yards in just a flash and then it stopped right at the edge of the road. I was scared frozen, I couldn't scream or run and we just stood there for what seemed like an eternity but in all actuality was probably just a second or two. Then suddenly it let out a load high pitched growling sound and then I screamed and it turned and ran and I ran all the way home. When I got home I was so upset I could hardly breath or talk, my parents finally calmed me down and I told them what happened but they didn't believe me. The next day my dad and my uncle went down there to look for tracks but they didn't find any. My uncle told me I probably saw a bear but even I know a bear can't run on two legs. The creature I saw was extremely large, I would have to say now that it was at least 7 feet tall very broad shoulders, covered from head to toe in dark brown to black hair, his mouth and large, square teeth kind of stuck out from the rest of the face and the eyes were sunk in. As a veteran I can tell you that I've never been so scared in my life.",

Somewhere down Co. Rd. 17 the pavement ends and it becomes a dirt road (if that dirt section has not since been paved) from what I recall. There are other dirt roads going off Co. Rd. 17. Lookout Mountain is just off one of those dirt roads on the left. I may have actually made a right turn somewhere off Co. Rd. 17 to get to Lookout Mountain. I don't really remember. Besides it was only the second, and last time I had gone out to this place.",
