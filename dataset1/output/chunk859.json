Right after that, the coyotes stopped and didn't bark or yip anymore that night.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "A.J. owns and operates a 1400 acre buffalo and elk ranch in Errol.  Clear Stream runs directly through his property.  A.J. indicated that the incident took place in the fall of 2014.  He couldn't remember the exact date - but indicated that it was either September/October time frame.A.J. stepped out onto his back deck around 6:30 - 7:00 pm - not quite sure the exact time - but, it was getting dark - it was a clear evening.  He could hear a pack of coyotes howling and yipping fairly close to his property - just on the other side of the stream. He indicated that it was approximately 200 yards away.  (He did indicate that they do sometimes take carcasses of deceased animals to a pasture on the other side of Clear Stream on their property.) The area for the elk and buffalo is surrounded by a 9 foot tall fence and he does have to go around and look for breaks in the fencing.  Moose have been known to take down the fence.While standing on his deck listening to the coyotes he indicated that he heard a very loud vocalization.  He heard a total of three vocalizations each probably 10 seconds apart.  He heard the first one and then went to the door and told his wife and daughter to come out.  His daughter, Zoe, 9 at the time - was able to hear one of the vocalizations with her father.  After the first vocalization he did not hear the coyotes anymore.A.J. is a hunter and familiar with the woods and the sounds of the forest.  He has heard coyotes, bobcats, fisher cats, bears, & moose and knows the sounds they make - he indicated that this vocalization was very strange and almost sounded \"backwards\". He even attempted to imitate the vocalizations for me - but, said that he couldn't do it with the force that this animal had. The vocalizations caused his chest to vibrate.A.J. indicated that he did not investigate what made the sounds but, did go out he next morning to look for sign but didn't see anything since the ground was starting to freeze.If he has any other experiences or hears any vocalizations he will let us know.",
