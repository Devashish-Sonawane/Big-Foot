            "Observed": "My husband and I owned 32 acres in rural Stevens county for almost 10 years. The property had been logged several times but still had a good but not dense, mix of Ponderosa, Larch and Doug fir. We camped there almost year round in a travel trailer while we were building a cabin. We dug and lined a large pond for irrigation which attracted lots of wildlife and had planted a small orchard and garden.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.She saw an upright figure about eight feet tall standing next to the shed about 100 yards away. She watched it for about twenty seconds to see if it would come toward her. When she yelled, it turned and dropped to all fours. It was in dark shadows, so was dark on its front but when it turned it was red-brown on its back. She could see about six inch long hair hanging from its triceps and from the elbow down. She did not see a neck or a nose. She does not remember the head shape. The shoulders were wider than the hips. When it turned, she saw what appeared to be hands but did not see arms swing. When it dropped to all fours, the back was straight or parallel to the ground. It may have been a bear.  The wood knocks made her very scared. They were all sixty to ninety seconds apart. She was so scared, she left the next day. There was no odor. She did not look for tracks. The nearest neighbor is one quarter mile away. She had never heard any hammering or other such noises from the farthest neighbor as the one suggested. Shortly after they moved the trailer onto the acreage, she found an oily hand print with fingers on the front trailer window. Others were found on the shed windows when she and her husband returned two weeks after the wood knocks. No pictures were taken and she wiped them off wondering who was looking in their windows. The hand prints were larger than either her or her husband's. They sold the property three years ago so are not aware of any ongoing activity. This report is farther west, but in the general area as report 50039. That report was in September 2015. I found the witness remembers details very well.  ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met the witness, at a parking lot near his home.  I was accompanied by a friend, who was a witness in a report investigated by Beth Heikkinen.  We followed the witness out to the site.  The witness had parked at a wide area that was an intersection of several roads. To the SW the road continues. To the south, another road is now blocked by large boulders. To the east is an old over-grown road that has turned into a path.  In order to get there you have to cross a creek.  The culverts that used to be under the road are piled up on the east side of the creek and you have to walk around them.  About 100 feet past the creek, there is a 4 x 4 trail that turns south and goes steeply down an embankment into a brushy draw.  The old abandoned road continues to the east on top of a wide ridge. Paralleling the ridge is the draw and on the other side of the draw is an old abandoned railroad grade. The witness and his six year-old granddaughter had parked at the rock pile. They crossed the creek and went past the culverts.  Past the culverts, they made their way down the 4 x 4 trail to the bottom of the draw.  The 4 x 4 trail makes a loop at the bottom and goes back up the way it came, like a cul-de-sac.  When the witness was at the bottom of the draw, they heard loud vocalizations .  He described them as an extremely loud screeching-yelling.  The vocalizations came from east of him and sounded like they were down in the draw.  There were two creatures.  He could hear the separation between them as they called back and forth.  The bottom of the draw is very brushy and is about 6 feet high.  The witness reported a feeling of intense fear because the volume of the vocalizations was so loud. He said that he could feel as well as hear the calls. Also, he could hear that they were moving towards him.  He grabbed his granddaughter and pulled her up the 4 x 4 trail to the top of the ridge.  The granddaughter was very frightened and was beginning to cry.  He stopped at the top and hid behind a tree.  From his position, he had a good view down into the draw below and would be able to see whatever it was.  He had a camera and was hoping to get a picture of whatever animal it might be.  When the creatures were about 100 feet from him, judging by the sounds, his granddaughter wailed, \u0093Those are African wild dogs.\u0094 (The grand-daughters mother had just returned from South Africa and had been telling her daughter about the African wild dogs).  When the little girl said that, the vocalizations stopped and the two creatures began moving away to the north-east of the witness. He said whatever it was, they were large. He could hear bi-pedal footsteps as they hurried away.  He said the foot-falls were very heavy and he had the perception of them almost shaking the ground.  He never did see them. The whole encounter lasted for 20 minutes. We looked the area over to get the lay of the land, and have the witness tell and show us exactly what happened.  We walked the area, taking photographs and looking for any track impressions or trails. To the south of the railroad grade is a large swamp created by a beaver dam.  Just south of that is the Nisqually River. Due to an unusually wet and cool spring, the grass is very high in the meadows.  There were numerous game trails with deer and elk tracks in them. About 300 yards from where the witness had been hiding behind the tree, we found a fresh trail through the high grass that was not made by deer or elk.  It looked just like what a human would make walking through the grass. The trail came from down in the draw to the south and proceeded in a northeasterly direction, crossed the road, and was lost in a very overgrown and almost impenetrable old clear-cut.  This seemed to be the likely trail of the creatures, although there were no distinct tracks, the grass was pushed down by something with large feet.There have been other reports from the area.  One class A sighting is the report referred to by the witness in his report. Report #20591  I believe that with the frequency of sightings and reports of vocalizations in this area that sasquatches use this area regularly.  What the witness reported was most likely vocalizations from two sasquatches, as no other animals make the sounds that this witness described.This picture shows the general movement of the creatures.  Red is where the witness was located. The photo is old and the roads have been altered by removal of culverts and being blocked with large rocks.This picture shows the trail through the grass that might be the trail made by the creatures.",
