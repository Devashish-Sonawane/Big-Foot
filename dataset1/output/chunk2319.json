            "Observed": "I was driving near the Puget Sound in Washington in the spring of 1993. I had just dropped off my friend at her house and was driving home on a 2-lane rd. I looked down to change the channel on my radio and I felt something push the backside of my car into the other lane. I looked up, scared, and saw something larger than a person walking quickly into the woods away from the Sound. I was terrified and drove home. I got home and was sure that there would be a huge dent in the rear of the car, but to my surprise there wasn't even a scratch.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Location and Historical background. This encounter happened in 1993 when the witness was a high school senior. Her father was in the Army, stationed at Fort Lewis. They lived in the town of DuPont, which is on the west side of Fort Lewis, which is now called Joint Base Lewis McChord (JBLM). She had just driven a friend home to Steilacoom, and was returning home on the DuPont-Steilacoom Road. This road is a very old road pre-dating the existence of old Fort Lewis and runs north-south through the west side of the area of JBLM known as North Fort Lewis. It is one of the open-to-the-public roads passing through JBLM. Be advised that getting off the road and into the forest is not permitted as it is U.S. Government property, and is patrolled. West of this road is dense forest all the way to Puget Sound. The distance from the location of the encounter to Puget Sound is .9 miles as measured on Google Earth. The Steilacoom/Lakewood/DuPont is one of the very oldest settled areas in Washington State. Steilacoom is Washington States oldest town. Although 19 years have elapsed, the area is not much different now than it was then in 1993. The Encounter.The witness was driving from Steilacoom, south towards DuPont. She was about 1 mile south of Cormorant Drive. It was 10:00 PM. Suddenly her car was shoved from the right to the left at the back end. It was a very hard shove, and she said she was startled and thought that she had run over something. Turning and looking over her left shoulder she saw a very tall, bi-pedal creature walking on into the woods behind and to the left of her car. It was illuminated by brake lights. She said that she was never so scared. Since she saw the creature walking away unhurt, and knew it was not a man, she did not stop. She kept on going and did not tell anyone for a long time. She only filed a report to the BFRO at her father's insistence.Creature description.The witness said that whatever shoved her car was very tall. She estimated that it was at least a foot taller than her Father, who is 6\u00923\u0094. It was gray in color and covered with hair. It did not turn and look at her at all, but just kept on going. It was walking upright on two legs.Conclusion.I am very familiar with this area, as it is not far from my home. I went there and drove down that road, re-tracing her route in the evening after dark. There is no creature running around the woods of Joint Base Lewis-McChord at night, who walks upright, is covered with hair, and who is strong enough to give a car powerful shove to one side other than a sasquatch. I have no-doubt that what Alicia encountered was a sasquatch who just happened to want to cross the road when her car was just at that place. Why would it cross at that instant, and not wait for her to get by we will never know since we can\u0092t draw any conclusions about its motivations or state of mind. ",

We were in a deep hollow that was heavily wooded, when all of us started mentioning this horrible smell.  Since there seemed to be no source of the smell, we decided to head back up to the car because we knew about the \"Mo Mo\" sightings that had been occuring in and around Louisiana.  No one was at home at my grandparents so we all piled back into the car.  My mom had left down the window and within a few minutes we heard something let out a scream.  My mom said it sounded like a panther scream, but between the horrible smell and the scream we did not investigate, we left in a hurry!",
