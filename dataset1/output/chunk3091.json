There were twenty Boy Scouts and one adult on this excursion between Payson and Camp Verde.The track was observed by all, in a very small muddy and grassy area next to the river.  The track was determined to be less than a day old, because the grass was still slowly rising from the depression.   The reason the track was so interesting was the fact that it looked like a large bare footed human track, and it was in a very remote and rugged area.  They could not see any claw marks emanating from the forward part of the track. After my conversation with Mark, I believe he and his troop of Boy Scouts observed a very large human looking track in a very remote area.",

I told Stacey the friend of mine and she looked and seen some red eyes looking at us. Whatever it was it was very large and kept peeking around a large tree at us.  This went on for a good 45 minutes or so.  Stacey also heard a knock and a scream coming from that direction, I could not hear it due to the water running closer to me.",
