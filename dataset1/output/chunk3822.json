The witness, is a professional  as is her sister,and their observation suggests an immature sasquatch. The round head may be characteristic of an undeveloped sagittal crest indicative of young specimens.Another consideration is the point of view that the witness had. She was downhill and looking up. This may have had an effect on her view regarding the size of the creature. The amount of time that's passed is also a factor. Its possible it was taller than she thought. Being backlit could also enhance the orange coloration observed.",
