            "Follow-Up Report": "I first contacted the daughter of the witness, who then put me in touch with her father and his wife who are the actual witnesses.   Her father and his wife have had a few different sightings of sasquatch from their living room, which looks out at a field behind their home.  The first sighting was several years ago and they also had two sightings last year.   One incident last year was while he was behind his home near the wood line there.  He saw what he thought was a hunter standing in the woods.   After a better look, he realized he was looking at a hair covered upright animal and as it started walking towards him, he walked back to the house. A few days later he and his wife were watching deer in the field behind their house when the deer seemed to spook.   They then saw a sasquatch slowly traveling along the woodline at the edge of the field.  The sasquatch seemed to frequently stoop over and appeared to be eating some kind of food item.  They were able to watch it for about a half hour.  It was black in color.  Both of these sightings occurred in November of 2009.   The earlier sighting was of a brown colored animal.   He had one other experience where he was out near an old shed that was at the other end of his property when he thought he saw a head peeking out behind a tree at him.   He stated that it happened so fast that he was not sure he actually seen what he thought he seen, but suddenly got a feeling that he needed to get out of there, so he went back to his home.  He also shared with me that he regularly puts out leftover food scraps for the animals.   The witness is a Native American, as are several residents in the area.   He said that most of the people in the area know that there are sasquatch in the area and many have had personal experiences with them.  They don't speak of it to outsiders and just want to live in harmony with them and have great respect for them. He also said that the local Native Americans hold different ceremonies in the woods where many of the sightings have occurred.   He stated that he would contact me if he had further sightings  or experiences.   I found the witness very honest and open about his experiences.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone about his experience, and found him able to recall these events very clearly.  The initial whistle sounds the boys heard started mid-day, and were thought to be possible peacock calls, but also having a 'chimp-like' quality to them.  These sounds were accompanied by 'brush popping', as if something was moving through the forest.  Since they were uphill from where they initially heard these sounds, they couldn't tell if it came from the ground or up in the trees.  The sound eventually got as close as 30 yards or so, and eventually stopped.At one point the witness' friend went to look down the hillside towards the noise, and that is when he stated \"something is moving down there\".  The friend, however, never went into detail about what he seen; when he was looking towards the area, his mouth dropped open, his eyes bugged out, and his demeanor became very serious.  He was very adamant about not going down to check it out, as if something scared him.  That night they heard the bird-like calls from opposite sides of their camp, about 30 yards away, which lasted about 45 to 60 minutes.   His friends have heard these sounds before while camping there, but never thought anything of it; they eventually all went to sleep, except for the witness' brother.During the night, his brother was lying awake when he heard someone or something approach the camp from the direction of the creek.  It stood at the edge of camp, breathing very heavily, before turning back towards the creek.  His brother thought it was their friend's dad come to check on them; however, he's never been known to do this, and the intruder came from the opposite side of the camp that the house is on.It is interesting to note that in other possible sasquatch encounters in and near Indiana, witnesses have described hearing peacock-like calls.  The area is very near the Ohio River, and the creek behind the campsite is part of a drainage system leading to the Ohio River.   In addition to his brother's possible sighting a year after this incident, the witness stated that he and a friend 'got yelled at' from 20 feet away while walking along some railroad tracks near the same area.The witness never talked to his friend about what he may have seen down the hillside that day; currently, the witness resides in the Pacific Northwest and is a member of the BFRO.",
