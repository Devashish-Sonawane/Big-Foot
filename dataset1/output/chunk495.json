            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the man about his sighting on the phone. On the evening of November 10, 2010, having left the Miccosukee Casino after 9PM, the man drove south on SW 177th Avenue (also known as Krome Avenue) in western Miami.  Google earth image of the location:When he and his friend were near mile marker 22, the driver noticed a tall bipedal figure cross the road on the outer scope of the headlights. The figure crossed left to right in about 3 strides.  It was dark in color, estimated to be 8 to 9 feet tall, and appeared to be \u0093jogging\". The witness claims the body build was proportional to its height, and its body was hunched forward.  It never looked in the car's direction.    Street view:SW 177th Avenue is a two-lane road that runs north and south, skirting the Everglades. Once a seldom used road, traffic has become heavier since the Miccosukee Tribe opened a casino and resort out in the Everglades in 1999. On the east side of the road, there is a canal and railing. The west side goes straight into the Everglades. The creature was already over the railing when the driver saw it in the headlights. The area the creature was seen is swampland.  Close to this sighting on the west side is Camp Krome and Krome Detention Center.  The Detention Center is an active detainee center where undocumented refugees are held until they are deported.  Camp Krome is now abandoned buildings and missile silos. It was used during the Cuban Missile Crisis.",
