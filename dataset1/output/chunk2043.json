There was one small Volvo or Audi parked at the trail head when we went into the trail and signed the Login Registration at the Trail Head. We had been at the location for 30 mintues, when we heard a very deep sound almost roaring sound from a very large mammel. I am an expericenced pack packer and had years of experience in boyscouts and have had many encounters with Bears, and on occasion, have had to take food bags away from a very large bear that stole a hikers food near avalance pass in the High peaks. I have heard Bobcats and Coy-dogs and this was no animal that I had ever heard, including a possible bigfoot sighting I had nearly 10 years ago.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke by phone with the witness J. W. He is a level headed individual with moderate experience as an outdoorsman, esp in the Adirondacks. When questioned regarding he and his wife's encounter he recalled a faint \"skunky\" type odor at about the time of the encounter, but indicated that it may have been the wet debris on the forest floor, but was stronger than he would have expected. As you will note, this is a \"sound only\" report. Nevertheless the witness is quite credible as to what he experienced and has enough outdoors expertise, esp in the Adirondacks to state clearly that was not dealing with anything he has experienced before including bear, moose, bobcat, cougar etc. He reported that the most significant thing about his encounter was the overwhelming volume of the call, he stated that it would be physically impossible for a human to make such a loud vocalization. He also indicated he experienced a profound fear response unlike anything he has ever experienced before, and that he has on occasion had to face down bears on his frequent camping trips in the area and is not given to being afraid in the woods. He was somewhat concerned in that this encounter took place less than 10 minutes drive from his house; for those (Bill P) who know the area, this is on the other side of Pilot Knob going East, near Hogtown road. He also indicated that the noise followed him and his wife as they exited the area and he had the distinct feeling that he was not wanted there. His fear would be palpable to anyone speaking with him. This is the typical NY State marked trail with a small parking area and log-in book, however, I know the general area pretty well; there are miles and miles of wooded wilderness where few humans go. I have often nightfished off the West (more settled) side of Lake George and have marvelled at the fact that through miles and miles of fairly high mountains there can hardly be seen any lights at all at night on the eastern side.

Anyone who has owned a malamute knows they are very bold dogs that basically aren't afraid of anything especially when there's more than one. When the dogs (near Oregon) tried to claw their way into the tent, it sent shivers up my spine and I must say I didn't get much sleep that night. Again, with the incident at Richardson Grove, the dog actually stood up on its hindlegs and \"walked\" while lunging forward up a steep bank dragging my friend who weighed about 170 lbs with it in its pursuit of the thing that left big footprints. Never had that dog do that before or since in spite of many wilderness adventures, bear, elk, deer etc. encounters.",
