            "Observed": "Saturday of Labor Day Weekend.  My family and I were on our way to White Pass, Washington heading East from Tacoma.  About seven miles or so outside of Packwood heading up the pass we rounded a corner on Highway 12 and saw something covered in fur standing on the passenger side of the road at about 10pm.  Going probably 60, we passed it very fast.  Both my wife, kids, and I could not believe what we had just seen.  After waiting for a car to pass I quickly pulled a U-turn behind it and by this time had the kids screaming in the back of the van not to go back.  As we came back down we were looking out the drivers side window to were we had just seen it when the kids all screamed \"there it is.\"  The car in front of us had slammed on it's brakes too, so I assume they saw it also.  It had crossed the road and was now again on the passenger side walking along the guard rail.  As we passed by it we got a pretty close look at it.  We again turned around and were heading back up but now it was gone.  I have no idea what it was other than to say it walked on two legs, was covered in brown hair.  My gut insinct tells me it was fake, but I do not know.  I have tried to find any rational explaination for it but I am unable.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted Mr. G. in late November 2001 by phone and gathered the additional information:Heading eastbound on Hwy 12, right before mile post marker 136 and next to FR 46, is where the sighting took place. \"It's a right hand turnout; dirt road goes up a hill.  Hwy 12 turns to the left.  Our headlights hit this animal and we didn\u2019t say a word for a couple of seconds - everyone was quiet.  My wife turned to me and said 'Oh my God was that what we just saw?'\u201d  The kids began to scream and yell.It was dark outside, and the first time they saw the animal it was facing them and standing on or near the white line on the shoulder of the road.  Mr. G. thought the animal was shuffling backwards.  It held its hand and arm up to cover its eyes as if the light had blinded it.  Mr. G's wife thought it was swaying back and forth, but Mr. G. thought it was backing up.  The witness thought the time had to be about 10:15 PM because \"We left Packwood around 10:05 PM.\"Mr. G's son didn\u2019t see it the first time, as he was asleep on the back seat.  But when they turned around and came back down the hill he got good look at it.  The kids spotted the animal for the second time.  Mr. G. and his wife were looking out the window to the left because that was where they saw it the first time.  Apparently, the animal had crossed the road and was once again on the left hand passenger side.\"We turned around really fast and came back down the highway but we were expecting to see it on the left side (driver side window) of the road at its original location.  But it had crossed the road while we were turning around and we weren\u2019t able to see that.  The kids saw it first and began shouting wildly 'There it is!!'  It was now on the passenger side once again.  We got to see it again.\" This time it was walking up the hill facing them between the guardrail and the sideline.  As they passed the animal, it turned its back to give them a side view, as if it didn\u2019t want dust or wind in its face, or possibly it was afraid they might hit it. \"We passed it about three feet away.\"The animal was reddish brown.  The hair wasn\u2019t much longer than 3 inches on most of its body; however, Mr. G. and his wife both felt the hair was longer on its back.  \"When it turned its back the hair flew up on its back and shoulders.\"  Mr. G. stated the animal's height at around 6' 6\" - not much taller than a tall man.After the second time they saw it, Mr. G. felt the animal had to have stepped over the guardrail to get off the highway fast.  \"I turned car around real fast to try to get a third view and it was gone.\"Also of interest is the second car.  The driver had to brake for the animal, or was possibly astonished by what he saw and hit the brake pedal.  In any case this person coming forward to report what he/she saw would be helpful for this report.The witnesses, a husband and wife, are both school teachers.  Their two children also brought along a friend.  The kids' ages ranged from 6-9 years.  I found the witness very credible and moved by his experience.",

It was march and it was just starting to warm up around the area and well we setup camp and head back to my uncles house, it was about a three minute ride by four wheeler. We get some food and tell him we are turning in for the night so we head back to the site. It was about 6:30 when we get to the tent. We get a good fire going and talk for an hour or two. we get in the tent at about 8:30 or so. About an hour or so later my friend wakes me and he tells me to listen and it sounded like big thuds and tree limbs breaking. It almost sounded like it was circling the or site. It couldnt have been about 40 or 50 feet away. But the woods are so thick back there we couldnt figure out what it was. It sounded like it was getting closer. My friend was laying in front of the tent opening and sounded like it was 5 ft away. It got quite and we are trimbiling. and then we heard deep grunts almost like a gorilla it was very strange. Then it sounded like it was moving away from us going towards a bottom. There is a creek that runs through there and it sounded like whatever it was it was headed that way. We looked at each other and my friend had tears in his eyes. We never went back to sleep that night and we were to scared to leave. As soon as the sun was peeking thriught the trees we took off to my uncles and told him what happened and he could tell we were upset. We take him back down to the tent and look around but we found nothing. The ground was to hard to leave foot prints and it was covered in pinestraw and leaves. I have nor my friend has ever experinced any thing like that in our lives. We only told my uncle about what happened until now.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a 23 year-old male and is employed as a  Blackhawk helicopter mechanic. During his interview he stated that he had the feeling of being watched that evening before turning in. He also stated that it was definately the sound of heavy, bipedal walking that they heard. Due to the loudness of the footfalls and the duration between them, he judged the creature that made them to be quite large. Both witnesses were too frightened to look out or leave the tent until daylight. Although the creature came very close to the tent, it did not disturb anything at the campsite. Since the incident he has become a bigfoot enthusiast, but may not go camping again. This location is in the panhandle of Florida, near the Alabama border.",
