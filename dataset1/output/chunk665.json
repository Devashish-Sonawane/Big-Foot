            "Follow-Up Report": "The witnesses were able to record some of the strange evening and morning vocalizations with their \u0093Flip\u0094 camcorder and sent their recordings to me.  I shared the loudest recording with some other investigators, one of whom analyzed it with audio software. Here is the recording:RecordingHe thinks the vocalization is what investigators around the country are calling the \u0093Horn Vocalization,\u0094 which is still considered a \u0093head scratcher.\u0094  There are a number of similar recordings made in areas with sasquatch activity, but the source is still unknown.  The spectrogram of the recording includes a chord of three different notes produced at the same time, which is difficult to do.  This vocalization repeats; other \u0093horn vocalization\u0094 recordings are similar, but singular.  It is interesting to note that the spectrogram of this vocalization also shows a possible tree knock.In contrast, an analysis by an engineer concluded the following:  \u0093I still think the sounds are cows.  I think the multiple notes are either an echo or poor recording.  Since it was a video, I would immediately suspect poor recording with a possible echo.  The alleged tree knock at the very beginning sounds like an artifact of the recording starting.  We hear strange sounds all the time as radios start to transmit until the systems stabilize.  It could be something as simple as a finger hitting the camera as the recorder started.\u0094The witnesses camped in an area I\u0092ve also camped at and have been to a number of times.  I\u0092ve heard similar vocalizations which do echo there.  On one occasion, some friends who are familiar with cattle, were confident that what we heard was a cow.  Other investigators also think the recording is of a bellowing cow, which would be the simplest and most logical explanation for the location and circumstances.  Analyses of cow vocalizations don\u0092t match the \u0093Horn Vocalization,\u0094 however.  Without witnessing the source at the time of the vocalization, it\u0092s difficult to positively determine what produced it, so we still have a bit of a mystery.       ",
