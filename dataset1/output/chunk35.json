There was no shortage of noteworthy stick structures. Here are the photos he took of the possible structures:The following is one of a series of 10 hoops over the trail, up the hill for an estimated 60+ feet - After speaking with the witness on the phone for 25 minutes I concluded that he is a credible observer.A repeated return sequence of one knock, then three knocks seems more than a random happening.  This is a smaller, less popular park, so there were unlikely to be many humans nearby, especially with something immediately ready with which to return knocks.While the final sequence of rapid knocks were faster, they were not nearly as rapid as a woodpecker could make, per witness.Submitter also attempted whoops after knocks stopped, but no reply.",

One day about 2 weeks ago we were traveling on highway 301 and I saw a sign that said Dead River [Road]. I glanced to look at the river as this was in broad daylight.  What I saw I'll never forget.  I didn't even believe in bigfoot before this.  I saw a big white furry animal standing straight up like a human crossing over the stream. We were traveling fast on the road so we couldn't just stop.  I told my husband I just saw an animal as I was in shock about what I saw.  He didn't see it as he was driving.  It took me two days to realize I just saw a bigfoot.  I think I was in shock about what I had seen.",
