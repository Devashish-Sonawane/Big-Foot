            "Observed": "Me and my brother and our cousin (11, 10 & 12 years old at the time) used to frequent a neighborhood across from ours called Acorn Circle. It was a heavily wooded area that only had about three homes at the time. On the Southeast side of this neighborhood there were no homes at all and was especially a favorite spot of ours to play since it had a few curiosities about the area. Just to describe the location a bit; this wooded area had a nice canopy of trees and was somewhat darkened even in the bright daylight. There was this large mound of eroded dirt that had a patch of sunlight directly coming through the tree canopy. About 15 feet away there was a large drainage ditch that was about five foot across and four foot deep, someone at one time had placed a log across this ditch in order to cross it. On the other side there was an old VW bug and van that had been there so long that small trees were actually growing up and through them. Further back from this was the scarce remnants of a burned down house, we rarely explored back further than this due to the increasing darkness, heavy foliage and swampy ness.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with all three witnesses by phone. Each witness gave me their own account of what happened while they were playing in the woods. The older brother stated that they heard a branch break and they looked up to see a seven foot tall, broad shouldered, dark figure watching them.  When the animal repositioned itself the boys took off running.The cousin remembers that the animal appeared to be very tall. He said it was brown in color and very unkempt looking. He thought they were maybe thirty-five to forty feet from it.  He had recurring nightmares for six years about their experience. The little brother was on the same side of the creek as the animal and about thirty feet from it.  He stated that being the little brother he was always being teased and left.  So when his brother yelled to leave the area he was determined not to fall for that \"old trick\" and he stayed put. He remembers watching the animal grabbing the tree and looking at him. He described the color as being cinnamon and brown, \"similiar to a grizzly bear.\" He said it was built heavily, like it was wearing shoulder pads.  He also believed the animal to be over seven feet tall. Only after seeing the animal did he also make a hasty retreat. ",

I was standing and looking out the upper bedroom window and saw a large greyish / brown hairy figure trotting through the edge of the woods towards the log cabin and turn to trot across the earth dam. I immediately went down stairs and ask my friend if he was attempting to play a joke but he was already down at the boat in another direction. The figure had been jogging or trotting at a moderate pace with a hunched over stance and I witnessed it for 6 to 10 seconds before it disappeared across the lake. I am a Marine Corp veteran from Vietnam and I have better than 20/20 vision I have been on many fishing trips in the area for about 10 years. when the figure was moving through the tree area it looked as though it was brushing some of the limbs with its body",
