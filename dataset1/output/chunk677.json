            "Follow-Up Report": "On December 9, 2013 I interviewed this witness. There wasn't much traffic - a car was maybe a mile ahead, and a semi was about a half mile behind. His lights were on low beam due to the proximity of the car ahead.  About a mile south of the large curve south of Mineral Point, he saw a large, black figure standing next to the passing lane close to mile marker 36. He knew that the figure wasn't a bush or shrub as he couldn't see through it. The car's headlights produced enough light as he passed it to make out that it was standing in profile as if it had been planning to cross the road, black with a thick torso (\"...like a laundry basket thickness\"), the right arm hanging lower down its leg than on a human, and a very clear hand which was not covered in hair as he could see that its skin was lighter than the creature's hair. The creature was tall enough that he couldn't see the head, and the hand was about eye level to him. As he recounted the incident, his voice became shaky and rushed. \"It scared the s**t out of me. My first thought was what the heck was that? Then, did I really see it? It was too close for my taste. I don't want to see it again.\"As an ex-law enforcement officer, this witness is a trained witness with an excellent eye for detail.  I found him to be a very credible witness.",
