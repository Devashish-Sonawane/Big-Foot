            "Follow-Up Report": "Investigation took place in the summer time, not in the winter time. The distance from the car to the observed creature was more than a quarter mile. However, even though it was summer, recreation showed that the subject was very visible. The witness argued emphatically that the size, as well as the spread of the legs could not be matched by the individual attempting to recreate the subject.The stand-in for the subject attempted to leap from the road's edge into the ditch, where the witness' husband said the next track from the road was found.  The depth of the ditch was approximately 6 ft. and the distance was more than 25 feet. The recreator could not do it after trying 3 times without falling. He also could not make the distance.  Her husband also stated that upon landing perfectly the subject took a short step behind a bush to disguise itself from the witness in her approaching car.  It then paralleled a game trail by 15 ft. to the side.  He tracked it for 3/4 of a mile, observing that stride lengths were between 4 and 5 ft. without dragging its feet. The snow depth was 18 inches with falling freshly the night before.His return route brought him back alongside the deer game trail. Where he had found a deer that had both front legs busted and twisted, and had a rear quarter completely removed.  He estimated it had been dead for a couple days. He noted that the innards had been removed and there were signs of small animals having scarred the carcass. From the distance that the witness observed the subject, a person could easily differentiate with the snow drop background, a human or a much larger sized subject. I believe that the witness could have seen the definition that she claimed she saw. She never claimed to see facial features or differing hair length.The immediate area is heavily wooded.  The extended area is a combination of woods, fence rows and farm fields. Farm residences are not close together and not densely populated. The subject crossed from a heavily wooded area into a low forest  with spots of swamp close to the road. The woods were square miles in size, and undisturbed. ",

Thought was wild life or maybe a person. Then looked up a video on YouTube of people using a parabolic sound dish recording Sasquatch vocalizing sounds when I arrived back home. Was able to recognize the sounds from the video to what I had heard. It was a terrifying sound. The best way to describe it was a howl sound between a man and a ape. This is the link to the video of the sounds I heard:",
