            "Observed.1  ": "The Bureau is offering a reward of up to $500,000 for information leading directly to the arrest of the giant, hair-covered being, according to the Parks and Rec Department. Bigfoot was last seen on the Brushy Creek Regional Trail and made \u0093loud, demonic-like howl sounds,\u0094 according to the FBI most wanted poster. Parks and Rec first alerted the public two weeks ago that park rangers found strange footprints at city parks and trails. Then, video footage was released showing a mysteriously large figure running on the Brushy Creek Trail. Recently, some Round Rock teens and other area families have shared videos of their search for the enormous biped.   According to the recently released FBI poster, Bigfoot is a \u0093menace to wildlife\u0094 and is accused of \u0093destruction of government property\u0094 and \u0093terrorism of campers.\u0094 The creature is allegedly \u0093armed and dangerous,\u0094 according to the FBI message received by police. But is the Round Rock Hairy Man really that ferocious and ill-willed? So far, there has been no evidence of destruction or vandalism by the big man on the trails. Not even any food or sign of a campsite has been found. Just a few oversized footprints in the mud are the only evidence left behind by the beast. The Hairy Man seems to be abiding by the \u0093Leave No Trace\u0094 camping principals: respect wildlife, take out what you bring in, and leave what you find. So is this creature Round Rock\u0092s Hairy Man legend of yore come to life? Is it Bigfoot? Sasquatch? Or is it just Harry trying to find his Hendersons? Only time will tell.   According to the Round Rock Parks and Recreation Department, Round Rock police received an email from the Federal Bureau of Investigation saying it has added Bigfoot to the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List.  A video clip purportedly taken by a Round Rock resident shows a furry creature sprinting near the Brushy Creek trail.    ",
