            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by telephone. He said that the recollection of the sighting was burned in his memory, and he was able to provide these additional details.The bigfoot was about 60 yards away in tall grass when he heard it, then saw it. He said that it ran upright like a human, with very long strides, lots of arm swing, and at a speed that no human could match. It disappeared into the woods. He described it as having a small head, no neck, and no protruding forehead. He only saw the head from the side. It did not look at him. The top of a four foot high barbed wire fence near it appeared to be just below its waist.As an experiment after hearing about the wood knocking method of interacting with bigfoot, the witness did 3 wood knocks on the sweetgum tree. After waiting for a response and hearing nothing, he went about his business. Two days later, he found the broken limb on that same tree. The live limb, as big around as his arm, was at least 8 feet from the ground and pulled straight down. One other incident occurred in 1997 or 1998. He, his wife, and niece were looking at the horses near dark. One of the horses seemed concerned with something across the road. From that area, approximately 300 yards away, they heard a very loud, unusual vocalization. It started with a sound like an owl, then a howl, and then a higher pitched sound like a coyote. The witness had never heard anything like it, although he has lived in that area all his life. The vocalization was disturbing enough that they quickly returned to the house.The witness is a hunter and very familiar will all the animals in that area. I found him to be very sincere and forthright in his recollection.",

            "Observed": "While Hunting Ruffed Grouse with friend near Bean and Bear Lakes outside the small town of Silver Bay we heard and then saw a large unidentified creature.  We were near an area where there were alot of berries and were making sure that we didn't stumble upon a bear (which we had done many timees, and let me tell you...this was no bear).  We heard a howling that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up...literally.  ee both hit the deck and reloaded our 12g shotguns with slugs.  Not a word was exchanged.  We were both rather scared.  It was nearing Nightfall, and we had a long way to go to get back to the car.  This is a very rugged and remote area.  The howling was intermittent, but we could hear the animal moving.  It was a couple hundred yards away.  Unfortunately for us it was directly in our path.  This is a swampy lake filled area with heavy growth.  I have travelled all over the world, and this is some of the toughest undergrowth that I have ever seen. We cautiously moved toward the trail (and the animal) and moved a quietly as we could.  We were both experienced woodsman, and we knew this was no Timberwolf, Moose, Bear or cat. We dropped the 3 grouse we had shot as a precaution and contiued along the trail.  Off to our right we heard movement.  I remember being terrified.  It was clear that it was a large creature, but it moved VERY fast.  Faster than any Bull moose I had ever encountered. It followed us on our right flank for a few hundred yards.  It was now approaching dark.  We had lights with us, as well as first aid kits. I turned to my friend and pointed.  At that moment we could see a complete outline of this creature.  The reason it was visible, was that we were in the growth, and it was following, but there was a clearing beind it (an old logging camp area) and the light was still brigh behind it.  We both hit the deck again.  I find it funny that the thought of shooting at it didn't even cross our minds.  We were scared.  I had worked as a wilderness guide, and this was nothing that I had ever seen before.  It walked on 2 feet and stood AT LEAST 7 feet tall.  There was no way to really tell the color (due to the lighting adn our perspective) but it was a dark color.  We continued on our way all the while listening to this thing in the brush following us.  It was amazingly stealthy.  Like I said we were VERY experienced woodsman for our age.  We didn't do drugs or drink like other kids our age...we went hunting and fishing. It finally stopped following us as we crossed a ridge toward a more travelled trail.  We both remember the day like it was yesterday.  We recently spoke of it.  We have both since reloacted to the West Coast (me to San Francisco and He to Seattle).",
