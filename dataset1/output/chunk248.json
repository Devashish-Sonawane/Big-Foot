            "Observed": "For the last three months I have been hunting a 100 acre family plot of land that borders 8000 acres of WMA (wildlife management area) and I had several encounters with what I believe to be a foul smelling bigfoot. First incident and the closest was when I was in a climber hanging in a palm tree of a new area near a swamp and thick bottom; 30 min after being up in the tree I heard hard steps coming through the woods afterward I heard two loud claps as if something was hitting two trees together. I thought that maybe I may be freaking out over nothing then 4 minutes later I was greeted with the loudest deepest growl I ever heard in my life. Immediately my hair stood up on my head and I was denying that this was happening. After a few seconds of praying and reasoning that this is a figment of my imagination, this animal behind me took a few steps closer then repeated the growl. The second incident happened because I was scared to go into the woods so I took two friends with me on an afternoon hunt. The exact same thing happened that had occurred 3 weeks earlier. To conquer my fear I went back out after four weeks later. I was heavily armed. From a distance I heard a growl around the same time (first dark). Then an animal growled again and immediately I started shooting. I left the woods and the animal moved through the clearing at a pace I never seen. All I know was something was spreading apart the pines like a bulldozer. This incident prompted me to contact someone to investigate this situation. I have often been met by black bears in the woods but never have I experienced anything like this.  I believe we have the prime ground because this animal has become very territorial and refuses to leave.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spent several hours at this location until the early morning hours with another Investigator, Cathy Betz. It was quiet with nothing to report. The witness has had many other \"odd\" incidents since he has made this report.The area had oak, pine, palm, and swamp areas. There was a small cluster of homes close by bordering this property. The property then met up with the Ocala National Forest in the north to north west.The witness showed genuine concern for our well being while there after dark, yet he was unwilling to stay with us out of fear. He stated he did not want to be there after dark with out a weapon. Located near the Ocklawaha River and the northern part of the Ocala National Forest, Fort McCoy is a small community about 20 miles northeast of Ocala.  Fort McCoy was initially known as Fort McKay, a stockade built in 1828 to protect settlers from warring Seminole Indians.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a heavy equipment operator for logging operations and an experienced outdoors man.  The area he described is at an elevation of 4200 feet and has plenty of resources.  There are swamps, lakes with fish, and a variety of other wildlife, including \u0093tons of rabbits and small game, moose, bear, deer, cougar, and lynx.\u0094 This night, he followed three sets of unusual tracks for a mile on his way to a new logging job site.  In his excavator, he was right over the tracks and had a good view of them.  He described three distinctively as different size foot prints. He compared them in human terms as about a size ten men's, for the small prints, a size thirteen men\u0092s, for the midsize prints, and size eighteen to twenty men\u0092s, for the big prints. The tracks were on a new, packed, dirt road, with about half an inch of powdery dust on top. The steps were farther apart than he could walk without hopping a little.  The witness is 6 feet tall. The tracks were along the edge of the road, overlooking a gully where a stream flowed. The smallest prints were not visible at times.  He likened it to going on a walk with his wife and kids.  Sometimes his kids would want a piggyback ride so they didn\u0092t get too tired. He could clearly see toe impressions.  The toes were spread apart with 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch gap between them. There was no arch on the bottom of the soul.  The toes looked like they were gripping the ground when they pushed off with each step.  Although there were some similarities, they were not human tracks.  The witness also noted that the creator of the largest tracks would stop and turn to the side every so often, which he thought was \u0093weird.\u0094  His thought was that it was slightly ahead of the others and was stopping to wait.  It may have simply turned occasional to check behind, staying alert to their surroundings. He didn't have his phone with him, so he was not able to get any pictures.  By the time his shift was over, it started raining, so the tracks in the powdery dust were hard to see. The witness also described some strange incidents and issues they had during their logging operation. \u0093The funny thing is that we only had issues when we had to work through streams, installing culverts and constructing our road.\u0094 \u0093I had to cut 3 trees that were blocking the road one day. They were about 12-16 inches across and 30- 40 ft. long. They were all broke off about ten or so feet off the ground and laid across the road in the same direction, with the butts too far away to have simply fallen over. They were about a 1/4 mile apart from each other on the edges of the swamp.\u0094  \u0093One of the last things that happened was a work light on the main boom of our excavator was ripped off the 1/4 inch steel bar it was mounted to. The bar was bent down and slightly twisted, the light housing had three long cracks on the top like where fingers had gripped it and it cracked from the pressure, and was laying face down on the ground with the glass not broken. The height of the light is 14 ft. at its low point with the boom all the way down. There were no sticks or branches that could have done it the area was clean, and there was no bark or evidence that something knocked it off. It was ripped off of its mount, ever tried to break the plastic those lights are housed in? Not easy it takes a lot of force to break one and this thing was ripped from its mount the bolt was still tight on the mount with the light bulb intact lying face down on rocks and was not even scratched, when the plastic case was in about 3 pieces. From 14ft if it fell, it would've shattered.\u0094",
