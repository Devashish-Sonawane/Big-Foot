            "Follow-Up Report": "  This is my follow up on sighting report # 264, taken on the 12th of September, 2000, at approx. 6:30 PM.   Talked with Michael W. Sharply, about his encounter with bigfoot in the Los Padres National Forest, past Frazier Park, below Mt Able, and down into the Sheep Camp area.  Michael and his friend Al do a lot of hiking in this area, and seem to know it very well.  I attempted to question Michael using Thomas Steenburg's format.  Who wrote the book \"In Search of Giants.\"*When did the above encounter take place?  \"Late Autumn, September or October of 1992.\"*Day or Night?  \"Day, late afternoon about 2:30pm.*Describe the area in which this incident occurred.  Pine forest and heavy brush.\"*At what distance would you estimate you were from this thing when you first saw it? \"One hundred fifty feet, and it was down the hill.\"*What was your first reaction?   \"I thought it was a deer at the first motion, but it wasn't, because it   had no horizontal aspect to it.  The sight of it really bothered me, because I have seen elk, deer and bear, and sheep in the wild and it wasn't any of them.\"*What was it doing?  \"It was moving slowly, Forging and looking for things walking out from the brush.\"*Were you alone when you first saw it?  \"Yes, but I was conversing with my friend, Al who was about 100 ft. away.\"*Was it standing on two legs? \"Yes!\"*Did you ever see it go down on all fours? \"No!\"*Was it covered with hair?  \"Yes! Dark brown.\"*How tall would you estimate this thing to be?  \"A full size large man. It would be like looking at a five inch doll down on the floor.\"*What would you estimate its weight might have been?  \"Heavy, if it was a six foot man, it weighed 275 to 300lbs.\"*Did you see any facial features? \"It just looked at me by cocking its head over its right shoulder.\"*Could you describe any facial features?  \"No! Its face was not jetting out like a dog or bear. It was something unknown.\"*Could you describe its arms? \"No! But, it had 4inch hair all over its body and arms.\"*Could you tell if it was a female or mail?  \"No!\"*About how long did you see it?  \"About one min.\"*Did it ever make any noise?  \"No!\"*Did it see you?  \"Yes! When I called out to Al to come and have a look at it.\"*Did you smell anything?  \"No!\"*Did you check for footprints? \"No!\"*Did you report what you saw to any Agency?  \"No! Just family and one friend.\"*What was their response?  \"Surprise.\"*In your own words describe what happened.  \"We hike in the area once a month.  On this trip we parked on the road going down to Sheep Camp, which is a deep drop off .  Al was very tired and was resting about quarter of a mile past the spring at sheep Camp.  I continued further down a small ravine to its edge, which was about one hundred feet from Al.  I was talking with Al for about five min.  I then saw this vertical creature moving slowly through the brush.  Then I called out to Al, and that's when the creature cocked his head by looking over its right shoulder, and it then looked down and just took off on a fast walk and was gone.\"",
