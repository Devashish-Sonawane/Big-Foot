            "Also Noticed": "Actually, there were several odd things that I reflected on later.  The first was that while I was listening for this strange sound, I realized later, that none of the normal Summer sounds were heard.  No crickets, no katydids, no bullfrogs....none of the sounds that we always heard on a Summer evening were around.  It was dead silent....until this thing let loose with this God-awful cry.   Another was this odor that kept drifting up, it was really offensive.  It's hard to describe, but it was like a musty smell, that also smelled like death too.  Anyone who has lived in the country, and has had a rat die within the walls or floors, knows what I mean.  Add a strong musty odor to this, and it's close to what I smelled that night.   The third thing that I noticed, and maybe this is the oddest of them all, is that my horse was standing near the barn, when all this happened, and he acted like nothing was wrong.  Even when these things were howling or crying, or whatever you want to call that sound, my horse just acted like he heard nothing.  He continued to munch on grass, as if he neither heard nor sensed anything wrong.  This has always baffled me.",

They said they had not only seen it, but heard it.  I found this strange, as black panthers are not indigenous to Kentucky, unless a traveling circus had lost one, at one time.  But so many people had told us this story, and it was certain, that they believed it. I know what we heard that night, was no \"cat\".  The grunts and raspy sounds were more similiar to a bear, but MUCH deeper and more throaty.  And that howl or cry, was unlike any wild animal I had ever heard.  It can still cause me to shudder and send chills all across me.",

He had just come out of the house and was headed back to this truck, when this 'cry' stopped him dead in his tracks.  He immediately turned and ran back to the house, to grab the shotgun & shells, and when he couldn't find the shells, is when he called me screaming \"Where are the shotgun shells ?\".     In 1988, my husband was outside, although I don't remember why now, and I was in the kitchen, when he came rushing in asking me if I wanted to 'hear that sound'.",

            "Observed": "We were hunting third split rifle in section 26 of Flat tops in 2005. I had not seen many Elk in area this year. I hunted an area I had seen Elk before in the early morning by myself and saw nothing. My brother Greg got up late and went to same area. He said in open grassy area on side of hill was a large group of Elk in plain sight. Greg took a shot at about 200 yards from a fence. He shot at a large bull in group. He thought he was successful, but nothing dropped. He walked accross Derby creek down a big canyon chasing them, but to no avail. He came back and got me from camp excitedly after looking all afternoon. I have confidence in my brother shooting, so I said lets go back and look some more. After, we got back, we went to side of the open hill and found two separate blood trails. Not one, but two, which is strange. You could smell what I thought was Elk heavy still in area, so I thought. I followed blood trail down the ravine towards Derby creek. As I got about 1/3 down on Elk run at a very steep angle the huge bull Elk from the group came running crazed up the trail and was on me in no time. It about run me over and I jumped to get out of the way and I fell down. Then after I got my wits back from nearly being gored. A bout 30 seconds later we heard the loudest angry howl or growl I have ever heard come from the hill below me from the heavy woods. It made my hair stand on end. Everyone heard it, it was a 100 times louder than an Elk bugle and sounded like an angry animal or human of some kind as it echoed through the ravine. It really was something. In fact, it was the most awesome sound I have ever heard in my life. It spooked the horses from our other hunters and the guides horses as well as the hunters. In my mind, we may ruined a another hunters hunt. This is why the second blood trail, and the foul smell and the angry yell. I will never forget that day and my brother and I speak of it often.",
