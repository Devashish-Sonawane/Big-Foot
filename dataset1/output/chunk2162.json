The sighting was at less than thirty feet but lasted only about five seconds as the animal crossed the road going downhill coming off of a worn game trail. She described the bipedal animal as being over six feet tall, with a slightly stocky build, and covered with dark hair which hung about six to eight inches off the forearms. The face was very human and reminded her of Chewbacca the wookiee. Local legend tells of \"The Butter Street Monster\" which is a wolf-like animal that walks on it's hind legs. Butter Street is about a mile to the East of this sighting. The immediate area is also known for strange vocalizations sometimes heard at night.",
