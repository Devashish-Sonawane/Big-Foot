            "Follow-Up Report": "A 16-year-old girl, whom I spoke to by phone, submitted this report.  I first spoke with the girl's mother who said without hesitation that she believed her daughter's account of seeing an animal who's description is included in this note. The sighting was made at about midnight during the summer of 2000.  The girl, her brother (not spoken to, but I hope to arrange it), and a cousin were being driven home.  The children were riding in the back of an open pickup truck that was being driven by an older cousin.  About 30 minutes prior to starting out for home, the brother saw a large animal on the road up from the house.  He commented on it to the others and said he didn't know what it was. Shortly after everyone in the truck headed down the \"sugar sand\" road (the opposite direction from where the boy had seen the large animal in the road), the girl saw a large animal just off the road in the weeds, crouching down.  The truck's headlights made the animal's eyes shine green.  The other children in back saw it too, and as the truck began passing by, the animal stood erect on its hind legs.  The animal was about six feet tall, possibly somewhat shorter.  It had \"dark, shaggy\" fur \"like a dog's,\" that was about three inches long.  Its \"arms were long\" and it had \"big shoulders.\"  The girl was very frightened - all the children were - and she could provide no information about the animal's head, neck, or face - except that the eyes shined green in the headlights.The sighting took place northeast of Cass Lake, Minnesota, on the Leech Lake Indian Reservation, which borders the Chippewa National Forest.  Black bears are common in the area but the girl is certain the animal they saw was not a bear and also that it was not a man.  The girl has since seen the Patterson/Gimlin film and said that what she saw was \"more slender...  not quite as thick\" as the film creature.  The driver of the truck did not see the animal.  No one returned to the area of the sighting to look for tracks. If the animal seen up the road by the brother was the same animal seen down the road from the truck, it had to have passed near the home the children were visiting during the approximately 30 minutes between the two events.  The girl was quite articulate and believable in her descriptions.  She is also a firm believer that bigfoot creatures live in the forests around her home.",

All around the perimeter of the trailer court was a canal and beyond the canal was wooded areas. In one area, we had a play ground. The play ground was separated from the woods by a dry canal. We would wonder through the woods and play war around the scrub palms. One evening it was just getting dusk, we had finished playing in the woods and were hanging around the playground. When one of the other kids said he saw something moving in the woods. We all climbed the ladder to the slide, to see further into the woods. I could just make out a shape, it was large, grey or brown covered in hair. It was moving slowly through the scrub palms we had been playing in, moving away from us. We, being just kids, freaked out and ran home to tell our parents. Only to be shushed and told it was our imaginations.",
