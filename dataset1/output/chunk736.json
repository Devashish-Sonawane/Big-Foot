            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on May 29, 2009. I found him to be very credible, and consistent in his reporting.He observed approximately 10 to 15 very large prints that were accompanied by smaller prints in a 100 square foot area. The tracks indicated that the animals were headed toward a more densely wooded area. The prints were about 1 inch deep in soft sand that was on top of harder ground. Upon further investigation, he noted that within the wooded area there were overgrown bunkers that were no longer used. He surmised that it would have provided excellent shelter. There were entrance doors on the backs of the bunkers, and slits on front so that soldiers could observe the exterior. The witness described them as cave-like structures. He stated that someone couldn't tell that they were there unless they were walking on right on top of them, as they were now covered with trees and vegetation.He feels that the prints were real, and that no one would be out in the middle of a military installment faking prints that may not have ever even been found.I spent several hours in the general area of the sighting on Fort Bragg and feel that this would be suitable habitat for an undiscovered North American Ape. ----[Editor's Note - Matt Pruitt]Fort Bragg has yielded many credible reports over the years. I personally know two different individuals who trained at that location who saw sasquatches there; one in the 1980's, and one in the last decade.",

            "Observed": "I was walking home from fishing, taking a different trail. As I got about 2/3rds. up the hill I had the hair on my neck stand up and a feeling like I was being watched. This was around 5:00pm. I just casually kept walking till I got home always checking my back. It happened again within a week. Maybe a few days. Did not smell anything cause I had been fishing or no smell anyway. Wasn't long afterwards I was checking on the clouds of a thunderstorm when lightning struck close to the trailer. By this I mean I had my head out the door. I heard a yell about 70yds. behind the trailer. It didn't sound like a cow but I checked anyway. No cows had been in the area for at least 6 months. The scream was high pitched without coming down a lot at the end. With my wife being there, I just closed the door and didn't say nothing. I would say the following Sunday afternoon, my wife went to church at 6:00pm. and I stayed home to watch TV. About 45 min. later, I was laying on the couch watching TV, when something had blacked out my window at the far end of my trailer. The window was 1ft. wide and 3ft. tall. I had raised up to look out my picture window above the couch and it turned the corner and walked around the steps at the back door. It was looking off into the woods and as it kept walking, it looked at the ground.",
