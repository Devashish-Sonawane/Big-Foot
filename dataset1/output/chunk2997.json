As I turned to see what had happened, I saw a large hairy arm reaching in. This all happened fast, so there was very little time to analyze what I had seen, and I just sat in bed, scared to even move. I was around 13 at the time of the incident, the room was long and narrow...roughly 10'L x 20'W, and the window was between me and the door out, so I would have to get across the room and out going past the open window...this took a couple of minutes, as I had to get up the courage to even get out of the bed.",

We lived on a 7 acre plot which had a small pond full of fish at the north end of the property. The land used to be farmland, so we had a couple of barns and then behind the barns was a large wooded hillside that led down to Bean creek...this whole area is quite remote, and we never saw anyone in the woods anywhere around us...but we played in this area often, even having a fort in the buckeye grove at the bottom of the hill. All the land across the road was farm land, and there was wooded lots to the north of our property...one thing of interest...at least to me... there was an old farm house a quarter mile to the north of us that an old farmer and his wife lived in...the floor was dirt and they butchered hogs in their living room...this shows how life was back at the time of the incident...very rural settings.",

            "Other Stories": "I never really put these two incidents together, but looking back...I thought I should report this too. Coming back from Adrian Michigan, a larger town 20 miles from home, a group of us including at least three other kids and two adults and myself, came around the corner and down the hill on Beecher heading for Kiel Rd, when we thought we had spotted a bear standing upright in the clearing by the river. All of us agreed we had seen \"something\"...but there have never been bear in the area before. I got only a glimpse of the \"bear\", but I didn't believe that it could have been a bear...we went camping twice a year when I was young, and we went to Yellowstone seven times, where I have seen many a bear at very close range...this one didn't really look like the bear I had seen...but I did only get a short glimpse, as the animal ran off as soon as we got to the bridge going over Bean creek. The land this happened on is almost straight across from Kiel rd, and borders on Bean creek. Across the creek and up the steep hill, was the old boy scouts cabin, and the land to the south was all densly wooded and swampy, with the Bean running through it, for at least two miles until it got to Hudson. It was an open clearing that had recently been planted with small pines...the pines were fresh planted the year or so before, and were only about 3-4 feet tall at the time. It looked as if the animal had something in it's \"hand\" as if it were eating.",
