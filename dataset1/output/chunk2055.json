            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness and walked the area where the sighting occurred. We spent the night in a primitive camping site a hundred yards from the footprint find. I have since made two additional trips to the site. In summary:\u0095 The animal was over seven feet tall. \u0095 The animal's weight was over 350 lbs.\u0095 The animal was very heavily built.\u0095 Hair color was dark brownish. \u0095 The footprint measured 19 inches long. \u0095 The footprint was 7 1/4 inches wide at the ball of the foot.\u0095 The footprint was 5 1/2 inches wide at the heal. [Stan Courtney measured the hole at four feet wide and two feet deep.]I called and spoke with Tim Cashatt, the Illinois State Entomologist, at the Illinois State Museum concerning ground hornets. He stated that although hornets would bring back sweet substances to the nest they did not make or store honey.  While on my first trip to the site with the witness he saw what he thought was a very large upright-animal step across the road behind us in the night.  The next day while I was with him we found a 26 1/2\" footprint near where the animal crossed the road. The print although very impressive and visible to me in the soft dirt and grass did not photograph well. The article can be found here:Southern Illinois Giant",

We were going threw the woods and I felt that something was watching us. I turned and looked in the woods beside the path and I saw a large man like figure deep in the woods. I told my girlfriend to pick up a little speed that I was not feeling to good. So we got the horses into a trot and I told her to go a little faster so we did. I did not tell her what I saw because I knew she would freak out. I still have not told her about it. I told my husband. He and my friends husband went to the hills were we were riding. They did not find anything. But my husband said that he felt like something was watching them too. I dont know if it was some one or maybe a bear. But I know that I dont go riding up in those hills by myself.",
