            "Observed": "Was hiking around a lake in the Leadville Colorado area. This lake is well above treeline, 13,000 ft area? Found what appears to to be a footprint in some mossy areas between the glacial rocks. Further investigation around this lake found more depressions and tracks.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Over the course of three days leading up to Labor Day, this family found and heard several types of evidence.  This includes three tracks of varying degrees of distinction and piles of apparently chewed moss stacked on boulders.  They also heard what is interpreted to be communication by rock-rapping each of the three times they arrived at this location.  It seemed that their arrival was announced and, perhaps, acknowledged from opposite sides of the basin.  Rapping was heard in combinations of three and four.I have spoken at length with the two adult witnesses - the daughter was unavailable.  Myself and BFRO Curators have examined the videotape, a moss sample and track cast.  I personally examined the places they were found.  We are more than impressed.The moss has been identified as Fontanella spp. by a University of Colorado bryologist.  One particular sample  exhibits index finger and thumb impressions where it apparently was held while the green portion was chewed off.  The nibbled-down remains were found in piles.  While pikas and marmots are known to leave piles of vegetation on rocks, I don't believe these animals are the culprits partly because they leave the greenery to \"cure\" in the sun before storage, whereas, these moss piles were found with the green portions already eaten.  The pika/marmot hypothesis is also suspect due to the walking-and-eating pattern of the piles.  That is to say, where the moss came from is not where it was left.  In addition to this, the videotape shows what appears to be a 4-finger scrape mark in a muddy area where moss had been scraped from a boulder.A cast was made of the first track found by the daughter.  Measurement is inexact due to the difficult-to-cast, mushy substrate.  Approximate measurements are 15\" length, 3\" at the heel, and 5\" at the ball.  According to analysis by Dr. Henner Fahrenbach, a foot of this length would correlate to an animal 7'6\" tall (see Statistical analysis of Sasquatch Dimensions and Traits, table 1.)  Investigator's note: track measurement corrected from earlier version of report.I personally viewed more impressions that are not conclusive enough to call footprints.  They were, however, adjacent to the cast track, followed one another as if left by walking, and the stride measured 4 feet if, in fact, they were additional tracks.Following their experience, this family has become very active bigfoot investigators.  They were quite impressed by this experience and experiences to follow, as I have been.  Investigations are ongoing in this historically active area near Leadville, Colorado.",

            "Observed": "This sighting occurred while doing a Paranormal Investigation at Octagon Hall in Franklin, Kentucky. Upon arrival, we talked to the curator of the property and he advised us that an investigator from the previous night had a possible Bigfoot sighting. He also produced a cell phone picture taken the next day of the fields about 3/4 of a mile away where the sighting took place. Around 2 a.m. a teammate and myself headed out to investigate the area in question. There is a large clump of hardwood trees and other foliage (about 3/4 mile long & 1/2 mile wide) in the middle of the otherwise barren field I vocalized a loud \"whoop\" a few times with no results. As time passed I decided to try the loudest, most guttural howl I could muster. I performed the call and heard two responses from a mile or so in the distance, but thought it could be the echo from the howl. A few minutes later my fellow investigator and I saw movement beside one of the trees about 30 - 40 yards away. We both stood still and saw a large silhouette of a humanoid figure peek out from behind a tree. It swayed left 3 times, paused; then sway 2-3 times to the right and stop.Since we weren't using our flashlights, our eyes were very attuned to the darkness.The figure was around 7 feet plus in height, the 1/2 of a large head, shoulder and arms that were past the knees.This activity continued foe a few minutes, to the point that I asked my fellow investigator if he was seeing what I was seeing. We actually took turns mimicking the movement as it happened. First me, then him. The timing and movement was exactly the same in real time as what we were viewing. We initially thought it could be a \"shadow figure\" of a large Civil War soldier, but the height, arm length and recent activity on the property prompted me to conclude that it was a flesh and blood Bigfoot sighting and not of a spiritual nature. When we tried to get closer to the figure it retreated for a final time     and was no longer there. We both went to the tree and there was nothing there that could explain the dark figure we both saw.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This observation occurred during a paranormal outing at Octagon Hall.  This Plantation Home was built in 1859 and today is thought to be a hot spot for paranormal activity.  During a check-in with the curator of the property, the witness was told of a bigfoot sighting that occurred the night before.  The picture shown to them by the curator was of the area where the sighting had occurred so they made their rounds on the property and performed a previously planned EVP session.They continued on to the area where the previous night's sighting occurred and made a few whoops and howls.  One of the calls they received was either an echo or a response.  It was recorded but when played back was too faint to be of comparative use. While debating which it was; they observed something \"peeping\" from around a tree about thirty to forty yards away.  It was 2 A.M. and with a slight moon, they described observing \"a silhouetted humanoid being swaying from behind a tree.\"  Half of the being was visible as it swayed.  They noticed the head was much larger than a human and the arms seemed disproportionately long.Since this incident, the witness has returned to Octagon Hall and had rocks thrown. The location is noted on the map below. They also photographed a possible footprint, also noted on the map. I am not including this photo because we found it inconclusive.Octagon Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was used during the Civil War by Confederate and also Federal troops, it served as a Civil War hospital. Built prior to the Civil War, it is now site of the Octagon Hall Museum & Kentucky Confederate Studies Archive. There is a slave cemetery, and historic gardens in season. Map of the location:",
