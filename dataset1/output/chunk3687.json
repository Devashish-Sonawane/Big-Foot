They have a small handbuilt cabin in Morrisville which they have had since the ealy 70's. They are only there infrequently, so similar events may have occured there that they are not aware of. The cabin itself sits in the middle of an open feild on a small plot of land (1 acre?), sandwiched between two farms (they are located of the far side of each). The nearest house is about 3/4 of a mile away. The feild is bordered on the other two sides by a dirt road and a heavily wooded ridge.",
