            "Observed": "It was early in the morning, I think around 6am. This happened to me in about 1984, it was in the fall. I was going to school at the time, and I'd have to walk about a 1/4 mile to get on the bus. That morning it was dark, and I was waiting for the school bus, I was alone. I was facing the roads and to the left in back of me was a grove of woods. I was standing there and I heard very heavy footsteps in the dried leaves. I moved down the road about 6-10 feet and it took about two more steps. Whatever it was, it was watching me. I was very scared. So I thought I'd walk down to the next bus stop, which was about 1/4 mile away. When I started walking, then I seen the school bus was coming. So I ran back to meet the bus and when the bus stopped to pick me up, I heard a growl behind me in the woods. That day when I came home from school, I looked all around for anything, and I could not find anything. I do know that whatever it was, it was watching me.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone, and obtained a few more details of what happened to him.  When this occurred, he was 16 years old, and  was alone waiting for the bus.  When he heard the footsteps, he could tell it was from something big and bipedal; he could hear the crunching of leaves underfoot as it walked, and estimated it to be 20-30 feet behind him in the woods.  As the witness moved along the road, the creature paced him in the woods.  While boarding the bus, he heard a deep growl behind him in the woods.  His ordeal lasted about 15-20 minutes, and he was very frightened of the whole experience.  The general environment is wooded, with sparse fields around the area.",
