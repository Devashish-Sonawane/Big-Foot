As they were driving, they all saw the animal on the side of the road as it stepped onto the road to cross. It was taking its time. When he hit the brakes to avoid striking the animal, it turned to look at them and kind of sped up or skipped, to avoid getting hit. When they turned around inside the car to look at it, it was gone.The witness estimated the animal\u0092s height at 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall. It was muscular but not stocky. The family is not originally from the US and did not know what it was. When they heard about the Manitoba footage they thought it might be the same kind animal.",
