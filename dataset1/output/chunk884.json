Just beyond the intersection of Kennesaw Street (noted on some maps as Kennesaw Avenue), the two men observed a very large, bipedal, hair-covered animal crossing the road from east to west. The witness noted that the creature's very large eyes reflected the light from the vehicles headlights very brightly. For a brief moment, the two men were able to see the creature fully illuminated in the headlights of the vehicle. The animal stood nearly eight feet tall, and was covered in dark red hair of various lengths. The hair on its arms was \"as long the hair on a horse's tail\" according to the witness. It was a large, massive animal, that moved quickly and fluidly. The witness was adamant about what he and his grandfather had seen. He is both curious about the animal he saw, and amazed by it. ",
