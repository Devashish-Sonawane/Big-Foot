            "Observed.1  ": "The size of the tracks and the distance between each track does suggest a theory, however. \"There were three of us that found them,\" said Brian Rogers. \"We were working on a trackhoe [clearing the creek bed of beaver dams]. It was when the snow was on the ground. We were walking along and said, 'Hey, look at that. You ever see anything like that?' We were looking at it, took some pictures of it. None of us had ever seen a track like that before. It was kind of shocking.\" Rogers wears a size 10 boot, he said. The tracks extended about three inches beyond the end of his boot. Evident in the photographs are five toes. The distance between each track suggests a creature taller than Rogers' five foot, 11 inch frame. \"I'd have to really stretch out to meet the steps this thing was taking,\" he said. The trio traced the creature's path for a distance. \"It came down, crossed over a pipe we put in a year or so ago and went up the other direction and went into a thicket in Boyd's Bottom,\" Rogers said. \"We quit following it from there.\" By his own admission, Rogers spends a great deal of time out-of-doors. But the prints were of a kind he had not previously encountered. \"I've seen bear tracks, deer tracks, horse tracks, cow tracks ... I've never seen anything like that,\" he said. \"In all the years I've been hunting, I've never seen a track like this.\" Does the discovery erode some of the skepticism Rogers owns regarding the existence of Bigfoot? \"Yeah, I guess,\" he said. \"But I still want to see one to believe it. I can't explain it.\" Fellow CDC worker Chris Carte echoed some of Rogers' remarks. \"When I first saw them I thought it was a little weird,\" he said. \"I've never seen anything like it. I've went out with Brian hunting this past deer season. We hunted the same area, didn't see anything like it. I didn't know what to think it was to start with.\" A self-professed skeptic as well, discovering the tracks also removed some of Carte's skepticism. \"Yeah ... some,\" he said. \"It's a little weird seeing something like that ... and there was a trail of them.\"",
