            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on the phone, and found him to be very credible. He recounted the incident which occurred nearly forty years ago with vivid detail. At the time of this occurrence the witness had an awareness of a large human-like creature, but had no idea what they were. In 1966, when he got back from Vietnam, he was hunting deer along the Missouri River on the Missouri side, across from Fort Leavenworth. He was walking in the woods at daybreak with a fresh inch or two of snow on the ground. On the way into his location he had not seen any other car tracks, so he knew that he was alone. He found a set of tracks that were human looking and large. The prints were perfect, and had to be fresh. His size 11 combat boots fit inside the prints and made his feet look small by comparison. He tracked the animal. At one point it back-tracked on itself, paralleling about twenty feet to one side of where it had walked. It did this for twenty to thirty yards and then stood for a while next to a willow tree which it stripped bark off of. It then headed toward the river through thick brush. The witness decided at that point to concentrate on his deer hunting.A few years later, in 1970, he was driving around with his nephew and two girls. They stopped at Dakota Point in Stone State Park on the north edge of Sioux City, Iowa. His nephew Bob stayed in the back seat of his convertible while the witness and the girl he was with took a blanket and headed toward an overlook of the Big Sioux River, a few feet to the west of the car. The parking area was gravel at that time, and the witness parked his car right in the middle of this small lot, headed out. It was probably around midnight or one 0'clock a.m. The weather was very dry. The gravel drive coming in was dusty and the grass was completely dry, with no dew. The witness believes that it was a female bigfoot that came upon he and the girl he was with, approaching them from behind him, from the northwest. There is a trail leading into the woods in that direction and the witness feels that the bigfoot may have come up that trail. No sounds were heard prior to the scream. There was total silence. It was very quiet. The witness said that the scream sounded like a monster from hell. The two on the blanket reacted with instantaneous terror, jumped up and ran to the car, leaping into it without opening the door. The witness started his car, put it in gear and sprayed gravel as they fled the scene, leaving the blanket behind. The witness was 24 years old at the time, and his nephew Bob was 19. The '62 Chevy convertible was a robin's egg blue Impala.The ground was level where the two were laying on the blanket. The scream came from above them, and so the bigfoot had to be within a few feet of them. No approach was heard. The witness couldn't compare the sound of the scream to anything. The loudness was like standing in front of a big speaker at a concert. The sound vibrated right through him. The scream lasted long enough for them to jump into the car, at which time the tone of the scream changed and it became much higher in pitch, which is when it sounded exactly like a woman screaming. The witness described other incidents that had happened right around the same time as this encounter. In about 1975 the witness spoke with a police sergeant in Sioux City who had been called to the scene of an occurrence in Riverside, which is a northern suburb of Sioux City not far from Stone State Park. It was a K-9 unit. A bigfoot had been seen on the porch of a house, and it had left the scene by going over the top of a ten foot tall fence. The police dog would not track it  (this event corresponds to John Green's incident #991084 dated 1974 available in his database). In 1974 someone shot a bigfoot with a high powered rifle (this event corresponds to John Green's incident #991083 dated 1974 available in his database), and four teenagers ran over a small one with their car (this event corresponds to John Green's incident #99108 dated 1971 available in his database). The witness states that there have been no reports of bigfoot since these incidents. An incident involving a visual observation and tracks from 1997 is recorded in John Green's database (#992833; Sioux City, IA, Journal, Aug.9, 1997).I conducted a telephone interview with the witness's nephew Bob, who was in the back seat of his car. I found him to be very credible as well. This witness said that the incident took place at the lookout point in Stone Park just north of the Riverside area of Sioux City. There had been sightings and tracks found around the area but he hadn't thought much of it, taking it all with a grain of salt. They were up there with a couple of gals in his friend's '62 Chevy Impala convertible. He said he will never forget that car. His friend and a gal went down over a ledge. All of a sudden there was a horrendous screech. It sounded so close it could have been next to the car. The hair stood up on the back of his neck. It was a dark night with stars but no moon. He looked around but didn't see anything. His friend came running up to the car and jumped in and started the engine, and the girl he was with came running after him yelling 'Wait for me!' The scream was bone-chilling. A few minutes before it happened it was dead still. Usually you would hear crickets and such, but everything went silent. This witness said the incident occurred during June or July of 1970. He said that if I were to check the archives of the Sioux City Journal for two or three years around that time that there should be articles about a lot of bigfoot activity in the Riverside area. There were gardens raided, poultry missing and sightings.Stone State Park is located in the northwest corner of Sioux City, along Iowa Highway 12, four miles north of Interstate Highway 29. The park consists of 1,292 acres in Woodbury and Plymouth Counties.Stone Park is located entirely in the unique Loess Hills. The Loess Hills start a few miles north of the park and stretch south to the Iowa-Missouri border. The steep hills were formed over a very long period of time, between 18,000 and 150,000 years ago. The rugged topography of the park is typical of the Loess Hills of western Iowa, and offers many scenic vistas of wooded valleys, dry prairie ridges, the Big Sioux River, and the neighboring states of South Dakota and Nebraska. Stone Park is recognized nationally as an \"Urban Wildlife Sanctuary\". Wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, coyotes, and red foxes can be found here. A variety of birds can be seen, including: turkey vultures, barred owls, rufous-sided towhees, and ovenbirds. ",

When we heard(me, mother,father, 4 brothers, 1 sister and a friend) all heard a loud hair raising scream some what like that of a pterodactyl dinosaur. somewhat like a sucking in sound. it was very long like from something with very massive lung capacity. There was a pause between each scream there were four screams total. my mother attempted to imitate the sound and it replied back each time. Earlier that day were took pictures of what were believed to be 2 sets of tracks down a road about a mile from where we heard the screams. The tracks one a smaller and a larger set. The forest was very old with huge trees that had fallen with other trees the same size growing out of them. some trees were so huge I could not see over the fallen one and I am 5'7. There was not sound in this forest it was completely silent. Very eerie. The only sign of wildlife was foot long slugs. the soil was very dark and rich. the moss was think. I put my finger through some moss to see how thick it was and my finger did not touch the ground.",
