The most memorable event is the one reported. It occurred in April of 2002.\u0095 The witness stated the animal was 7 feet tall, weighed 350 pounds and looked very muscular.\u0095 The hair was medium brown and long like a \"long-haired dog.\"\u0095 The hair was not matted.\u0095 The witness said although she could not see the face very well, she could make out a big brow and the eyes appeared to be deep set.\u0095 The animal had a fat, wide neck, very long ape-like arms and big hands.\u0095 The animal leaped sideways three times going from tree to tree.\u0095 After leaping sideways it made a leap forward. This alarmed the witness and she ran back into the house.\u0095 The animal came as close as 20 feet to the witness while on the other side of a chain-link fence.",

            "Observed": "I was taking pictures for my Photography class at Haskell University near the Wetlands.  I had walked over a pile of dead and chopped wood into the woods about fifty feet when I heard something ahead.  I looked up and saw something standing there, then immediately take off, and without much of a start jump about 7 to ten feet in distance over a fallen tree which was about five feet high.  It disapeared into the bush, and did not make a sound in its retreat.  The first moment I thought it was a worker from the nearby factory wearing a big coat, then I quickly realized what it was.  It had a full body of dark blonde/light brown hair, about 6'6\" or taller, and had a slight slouch to itself.  It was also very fast, very illusive, and had seemed to disapear in a glimmer when it took off.  I could not hear it beyond the brush where it took off to, so I thought it was still close by.  So, as scared as I was but with a camera in my hand I had to follow, but when I got into the brush there was nothing.  I didn't hear anything nearby, no bushes moving, no twigs cracking, nothing.  Though I felt as if I was being watched, as if something was still there, close by.  I just took a deep breath and took off to my car and went home.  It was the coolest yet scariest moment in my life.",

The animal was looking down and he was unable to make out any facial features.  Its hair was of a uniform length.Also found in the area was a large pile of feces which was described as humanlike but larger and upon further examination was shown to contain a small amount of fur and bones. I questioned him as to why if he was carrying a camera he did not take a picture.  He answered that the camera was of an older type and he had neither the time to get the correct settings nor the mental composure to do so. ",
