            "Observed": "On September 28, 2015 at approximately 8:45 pm myself and two co-workers were outside work talking about our day. Where we work is pretty remote, southeast Iron county close to Madison County line. It was a cool, cloudless, quiet, full moon night. I know this because we were discussing how well we could see the stars that night. The three of us were looking up at the stars when we heard a howling noise which lasted at least 10-15 seconds. We were at an awe on what it could have been. We are all hunters and have plenty of time in the woods. This was no sound we had ever heard before.  After doing some research online we've all come to the conclusion what we heard was a sasquatch Aka big foot.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "In Summary:Exact date was remembered since the howl was heard the night after the Lunar Eclipse of September 27. I spoke with the witness and asked her to compare the call heard to other supposed Bigfoot audio recordings.  She stated it was a long whooping howl louder than anything she and her co-workers had ever experienced before.  The witness compared it to the 1994 Ohio - Moaning Howl and the 2006 Florida Howl recordings, with the Florida Howl being the most similar.   I am familiar with the area, there is a rich history of Bigfoot activity here that goes back to the pioneer days, and certainly before.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the reporting witness and one other individual who was present during the incident. The witness said the animal ran from the woods near their fire toward the lake, a distance of about 75 yards. It ran in circles as if confused, all the while waving its arms above its head and vocalizing. Although the reporting witness said he had no real impression of arm length, the second witness said he thought the arms were longer in proportion than a typical human. The second witness said the creature definitely had hands; \"just like a little kid \u0096 the way it would raise its hands and shake them.\" The reporting witness estimated the height at around 4 feet, the second witness at between 4 and 5 feet. The color was dark. The second witness attempted to imitate the vocalization for me, which the first witness said was a pretty good imitation. The vocalization was a rising and falling yell with a distinctly distressed sound to it. The witnesses related that when the creature first burst from the woods they all sat stunned for a few moments, then jumped to grab flashlights. The reporting witness thought that the sudden movement of everyone around the fire may have been what caused the creature to run back into the woods. In the morning, the witnesses did not find tracks or other evidence. Both witnesses are experienced woodsmen and agreed that the creature was not a turkey, raccoon or bear. No further incidents have occurred although the witnesses have returned to the area several times.",
