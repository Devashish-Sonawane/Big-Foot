            "Follow-Up Report": "I initially spoke with TH, the witness' brother, who was at the location about an hour after the sighting.  TH arranged to have RH, the witness, meet us at the sighting location on the evening of 8/1/08, less than 24 hours after the encounter.The witness, RH, was slowly driving (about 10 or 15 mph) uphill around a hairpin turn when he noticed the animal in the woods, approximately 60 feet to the left and above him on the hillside.  It was standing behind and to the right of a small cluster of trees.  The witness says that the creature, noticing that it was exposed, turned 180 degrees to its left and quickly ran up the hill behind where it was standing.  Its speed was faster than a normal man could run on flat ground, though the terrain was very steep, uneven and brushy.Immediately after the sighting, RH called his roommate and brother TH, and told him what happened.  RH continued to their nearby home, picked up some gear and returned to the sighting location, which is only a few miles from their house.  When he arrived back at the sighting location, there were two police cars parked at the turn.  RH got out of their vehicle and asked the officers what was going on.  The officers said they were responding to a call that stated there was a hairy, naked, homeless man in the woods by the river.  RH told the officers that he had seen it too, and it was a bigfoot - not a homeless man.  The officers chuckled and paid little attention to RH's claim.  The officers soon left the scene.  After TH arrived at the scene, the two brothers stayed in the area for a while and videotaped the scene.  TH took his dog and went up the hillside and RH stayed closer to the vehicle, being too shaken to explore the area so soon after his encounter.  TH went up the hill above where the creature was standing, and found some deep, yet featureless impressions in the thick forest duff.  About 75 or 100 yards above the spot where the creature was standing, there was a large washout in the hillside that was a kind of clearing, though there was thick underbrush.  When TH arrived at this spot, he was \u0093hit so hard\u0094 by an overwhelming \u0093moving and powerful\u0094 feeling.  TH stated that this feeling gave him \u0093a whole new level of goosebumps\u0094.  At that point, his dog took off running downhill back to the vehicle, which TH stated was very strange since his dog always stayed by his side in the woods.  They soon left the area and later that evening, TH found the BFRO website and filed a report for his brother.I asked RH to stand on the road at his approximate location - while I stood where the creature was.  By doing this, it is estimated that the creature was around 7 feet tall (see photo below).   RH described the animal as being very muscular and fit with a thin waist and very broad shoulders, possibly twice as wide as my own.  The creature's right shoulder was partially obscured by the tree it was standing near.  It was not as hairy as sasquatches are often depicted in drawings, though it was obviously completely  covered with dark brown, but not black, hair.  Its face wasn't hairy around the eyes, nose and mouth, though it was noted that it had hair on the side of its face like sideburns that turned back down the neck to its shoulders.  No details of the eyes nor mouth were noted, but the nose was flattened and broad.  Interestingly, it was noted that the creature had a short neck and its head was shaped like a normal human with no sagittal crest.   The arms seemed longer than a human's, and swung as it ran uphill.  Due to the foliage, no details were noted below the thigh area.  I spent many hours at the site, not leaving the location until around 2am in hopes of obtaining thermal footage of the creature.  Derek Randles, a tracker and long-time bigfoot investigator, was called in to help look for additional tracks in the area.  He brought a hunter friend and we scoured the area for several hours on the morning of 8/2/08.  A possible heel impression in a line of large, yet indistinct impressions heading downhill was all that was found on that day.This photograph shows the investigator in the same position as the creature, showing its height.",
