Donahue said he has received a report from a farmer in the area who is also a hunter who said he has seen a very large deer in the Cole Hollow Road woods. Donahue said the deer could be responsible for the mysterious \u0093monster tracks.\u0094 \u0093We do not need any help from any citizens.\u0094 Donahue said, \u0093especially those with any guns or other weapons.\u0094 Sheriff Donahue said his office would continue to investigate the problem and would notify the public of any new evidence. Harris is in fair condition today at Methodist hospital. Doctors said the bullet entered three inches above the knee on his right thigh, passed thru the back of the knee and lodged in muscle tissue in the right calf. Harris told investigating Sheriff\u0092s Deputies he and Richard Mudd, 1219 Fisher road, Creve Coeur, were in the area looking for the \u0093monster\u0094 allegedly seen in the area. Harris said he took the gun along to protect himself. He said he did not trip or fall, the gun just discharged. Mudd, who was reportedly walking ahead of Harris at the time of the accident, was not armed. The accident occurred about a quarter mile from Cole Hollow Road, Harris and Mudd were among about 100 persons in the woods stalking Cohomo. Randy Emert, 18, of 3527 Twelve Oaks, Peoria, says he and many friends have seen some type of \u0093hairy Creature\u0094 in the woods near Cole Hollow Road. He described \u0093Cohomo\u0094 as being between eight and twelve feet tall, \u0093kinda white and it moves quick.\u0094 Emert said he first saw \u0093Cohomo\u0094 about two months ago but didn\u0092t report it because \u0093people would think we\u0092re crazy.\u0094 He said he came forward with his own story when he heard about the sighting of Momo in Louisiana, Mo. Emert said he has seen \u0093Cohomo\u0094 twice in the last two months. In another sighting of a strange creature, Creve Coeur authorities said a witness reported seeing \u0093something big\u0094 swimming in the Illinois River Tuesday. Emert claims he has heard Cohomo several times and says it \u0093lets out a long screech kinda like an old steam engine whistle, only more human.\u0094",

The Marines told deputies that they were traveling west on Ave J, about a quarter mile east of 110th St. East, when a huge hairy thing, the shape of a man loomed ominously in front of their vehicle.  But, it didn't linger.  It turned and ran off into the desert, leaving the startled Marines who had just slammed on their car brakes.  ",

Sheriff Deputies who went out to the area where the Marines said they had the encounter with a big dark creature, said that the fields were hard packed, so there were no footprints. \tCoincidentally, at the time of the Marine incident, which occurred on the 14th of March 1973 at 1 A.M., there was a movie playing at a drive-in theater that was not to far away and called, \" The Legend of Bogge Creek.\" Which is supposed to be an extremely entertaining movie about such a creature of the Bigfoot variety.  Speculation could be that if the Marines had seen the movie and thus just about anything big and dark could have looked like the legendary Bigfoot.",
