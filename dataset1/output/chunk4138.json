            "Observed.1  ": "Whatever the name, wherever the sighting, the description is basically the same - large, hairy, upright-walking creatures that continue to mystify and terrify. While persons who swear they have seen the elusive beasts are sometimes brushed aside as kooks or over imbibers of distilled spirits, most are dead-sure of what they saw.  Darwin Hart, 50, Route 1, Claremont, recalls his experience as vividly as the night it happened - about 35 years ago - near Lawrenceville. \u0093There were five of us, two girls and three boys, going swimming in the gravel pits north of Lawrenceville,\u0094 Hart said from his residence in rural Richland County. \u0093We were in a 1952 Ford and were driving along a gravel road that led to the pits when this\u0085thing\u0085crossed the road in front of the car. We stopped, it stopped in front of our car\u0092s headlights, and just stared. \u0093It made no sound and I don\u0092t remember any particular odor. The thing was about seven or seven-and-a-half-feet tall and thin, not wide like a gorilla, and covered with brownish-gray hair. Its face was completely hair covered and the head was pointed. What I remember most was the length of its arms. They were very long and hung below the knee.\u0094 Hart, who was about 15 at the time of the sighting, said the five went on to the pits and went swimming, but it was nearly 20 minutes before anyone brought up what they had seen. \u0093Someone, probably me, the \u0092mouth of the group,\u0092 asked \u0092Did you see what I saw?,\u0092\u0094 Hart said. \u0093Everyone answered that they had. We weren\u0092t really scared, but it was like we were all mesmerized and not quite sure of what had happened.\u0094 After telling the story to his parents, Hart said many of his friends at school laughed off the sighting as a tall tale and he decided to keep the story quiet. It was only after reading of recent sightings of the so-called Big Muddy Monster near Murphysboro that he consented to retell his story. \u0093I\u0092m not crazy and I would stand on a stack of Bibles and swear to what I saw,\u0094 he added. \u0093Others in the group could corroborate the story. I haven\u0092t mentioned their names, only because I haven\u0092t had contact with them for some time.  Two live in Oklahoma and I\u0092m not sure where two are now.  But we all saw the same thing, whatever it was.\u0094 Hart said the creature was no more than 20-30 feet from the vehicle and in plain view of the car lights. \u0093It crashed off into the woods and we went on and swam. That was a long time ago, but with all the sightings around, it makes you wonder if they live in pairs and if some offspring are still around.  And it brings to mind that they must eat to survive. Are they vegetarians or meat-eaters?\u0094 And do they still frequent the local gravel pits on nocturnal visits?  ",
