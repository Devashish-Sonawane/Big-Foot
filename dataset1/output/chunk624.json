            "Observed": "As I was leaving my house and turned out onto the street,  movement caught my eye so I turned to see what it was.  Less than a football field away from me I could see something that immediately I knew was not a man and not a bear.  I could see what I will call a bigfoot walking north towards the water. We live near the water in Puget Sound.  It appeared to be slumped forward to some degree ... I guestimated it was 6 1/2 feet tall, but upon walking to that area later, I realized it must have been closer to 8 feet tall to be visible from where I saw it from my car.  It seemd to have long hair that was brown, like a brown crayon.  The face was mostly hairy but seemed to have shorter hair around the facial features.  The nose was more pushed in and flat than protuding, but the nostrils were turned up some.  It still looked more human than it did ape-ish.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness via telephone, and then did an on-site investigation. Her sighting took place as she was turning onto a road not far from her home. She admitted that she\u0092s a bad judge of distance, so she took her husband to the area where her sighting took place in order to get a better idea of the distance. She told me that her husband thought the animal was approximately sixty feet away. I asked her if she meant 60 yards and she emphasized that it was not yards, but feet. When I asked her for details of its appearance, she kept referring to it as \u0093he\u0094. I asked her why she kept saying \u0093he\u0094 and she told me that she felt like the animal was male due to its size, build, and features. It appeared to have \u0093messy, wiry, long, dirty hair\u0094. She estimates the hair length was approximately four inches and said the hair appeared to be thinner in some areas of the body. The top of the head and sides were \u0093definitely hairy\u0094, and the top of the head looked like a \u0093disheveled hairdo\u0094. The brow was noticeably big. In some respect it appeared to be very human like. She said it much more closely resembled a human than an ape. I met the witness and her husband at their home and we went to the area where the sighting occurred. After noticing the lower ground where the animal was seen, I would estimate that the animal was approximately seven to eight feet tall, rather than six feet tall as she originally estimated. She emphasized that it was not black, but a dark drown. She said that she could see its face and that its eyes were \u0093dark\u0094 and \u0093sunken in\u0094, with a protruding brow. She also mentioned that its head was \u0093slumped forward\u0094. She said its nose was flat and \u0093stubby\u0094 and its nostrils were \u0093more turned up than down\u0094. I asked if it was possible that what she saw was a bear. She was certain that what she saw was not a bear due to the fact it was walking upright and that it had a \u0093bad posture\u0094. She said it was stooped forward while it walked and that its arms were swinging as it walked.She said it didn\u0092t seem to care about her presence, and was walking, \u0093real mellow and slow, at a leisurely pace\u0094. It was traveling in a westerly direction towards the Hood Canal. She thinks it came from a densely wooded area across the highway from where it was observed. There was a pile of clam shells (about 20 shells) neatly piled up in the area where the animal was sighted. This was approximately one mile from the Hood Canal. It seemed unlikely that a bird such as a crow or raven would have deposited the compact pile of shells there. She mentioned being outside one evening in early to mid-October, 2005, in her in-laws hot tub and hearing a \u0093weird sound\" resembling a \u0093crying animal\u0094 about two acres away.  I played both the \u0093Ohio Scream\u0094 as well as the \u0093Ohio Howl\u0094 for her. She didn\u0092t recognize the \"Ohio Scream\", but when I played the \u0093Ohio Howl\u0094 she said that was very similar to the sound she heard. She said it was a \u0093long-winded\u0094 cry. She said it was much longer than she could do without having to stop and take a breath. There is a creek behind her home and she estimates the howls came from the area near the creek. I checked out the creek when I was out there. It would be much easier for an animal to walk down the middle of the creek rather than on the banks along the creek. It would be able to travel undetected, day or night, by walking down the middle of this creek. The creek originated across the highway on very densely wooded land and it emptied into the Hood Canal just north of the U. S. Navy Trident nuclear submarine base at Bangor, WA. She mentioned that she has heard a sound similar to a baseball bat pounding on a tree near her home. She heard the wood knocks around 9:30 to 10:00 P. M. in the summer of 2005. ",

            "Observed": "I was deer hunting not far from my home overlooking a cedar swamp.  I noticed a black \"head\" appearing above the pine trees (the cedars were short growing a wet lowland, I'd guess they were 6-7 feet at the time)  The head would appear and disappear periodically.  My best guess was it was eating something and moving around in the lowland.  It was visible for 10 to 15 minutes.  I would estimate I was 50 to 75 yards away from the creature.  No noise and nothing else was notable.  It did not behave like a bear and I've never seen a black upright for that much time.  I was sitting on a down tree and my cousin hunting with me was probably a quarter mile away.  He didn't see or hear anything.",
            "State Population Density": "51.2",
            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and have the following to add to his report:- The sighting occurred near dusk at around 3:00 to 4:00 PM.- The sky was overcast and the wind was still.  There was snow on the ground.- He only saw the animal's head.  It was conical, \"football\" shaped.  Their was no muzzle nor any ears evident. It was all black and from the distance the saw it from he could not discern facial features.- When it was visible, it would move around for one to two minutes at a time before ducking back down again.- The cedar trees were all about six to seven feet tall.  He estimates the animal's height at around eight feet.- He mentioned several times how strangely quiet the immediate area was during the encounter.  Normally, he would hear squirrels and birds constantly, but not that day.- He is not certain why it was moving the way it was, but his impression is that it was foraging in the cedars.- Originally, he thought it was a bear, but given it's height, lack of muzzle, lack of ears, head shape, and duration and movement while upright, he realized it was something else entirely.  The encounter ended as it got dark and he became scared and left.- Since he filed this report he has returned to the area and has paced the distance off, which was closer to 100 yards.- He was sixteen at the time of the encounter.I found him to be a very credible witness.  He has a long history of hunting in the woods in that region and had grown-up in the area. He now has advanced degrees in biology and microbiology.",
