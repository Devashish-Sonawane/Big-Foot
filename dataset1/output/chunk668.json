            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone. Her boyfriend has visited his cabin for twenty years and she has gone there for fifteen. In August 2018, she saw trees shaking before the deer ran out. This startled her. In December 2018, she heard \"wooden bat on tree\" knocks from two locations. There were three knocks, then a pause of about thirty seconds, then same response from another location. This happened five to six times. She became very anxious. No trees were shaking. No odor was detected. She did not see any animal tracks because it was snowing. Early 2019, they drove to the cabin just after the snow melt. One night, she heard whoops for over one half hour. She has spent a lot of time there and is sure it was not an owl. On the second night, the whoops continued for about one hour. Her boyfriend stepped out on the deck and the whoops stopped briefly but began again. The boyfriend said the whoops changed to a growl but she did not hear that as it was about 1:00am and she turned in for the night. She writes that she is somewhat scared and does not want their good times in the forest ruined. I discussed with her that the knocks may have simply been Bigfoot signaling each other of her and the boyfriend's presence, or the knocks may have been a distraction to draw attention away from a family unit nearby. I wanted the witness to enjoy future time outdoors and be alert, but not anxious. This region around the larger Sullivan Lake has history as a Bigfoot area.  ",

            "Observed": "I live in Biron, Wisconsin.  It was around 6-7 p.m. and my friends and I went out to the forest close to my house and I did a couple \"whoop\" calls. About 10 seconds after I did these calls, we heard a long howl that lasted about 5 seconds in length. We are convinced that this could possibly be a Bigfoot howl. As we were leaving, we heard three \"whoops\" in the same direction as we heard the howl. After we heard that, we all ran back to the house",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On 1/24/2013 I interviewed Jeremiah regarding his whoop vocalization which brought in return a long whoop vocalization.  He lives on the far east side of the town in a small neighborhood surrounded by woods.  During the summer he stated that at night he would hear distant sounds once in a while, like moans and hollers from deep in the woods.On December 19 Jeremiah, his sister, and a friend went out from the back of the property, across a street and onto a dirt path which parallels woods and hiked it for about a half mile.  His friend and sister sat down while Jeremiah faced the woods and did a long \"whoop\".  Within a matter of seconds all three heard what he described as a deep-throated, distant howl which lasted for about five seconds and which tailed off downward at the end.  They looked at each other, stunned, and unnerved decided it was time to leave the location and head back to the house.  As they walked back to the house they heard a series of three \"whoops\", which were much, much closer to them and sounded as if they were coming from between them and from whatever did the howl.  Freaked out, they ran back to the house.As recently as last week Jeremiah has reported hearing various knocking sounds at night in the general direction where the whoops and howls have been heard.Jeremiah lives about a mile from the location of a previously investigated likely Class B sighting on 2/28/2012, see report #34240I found Jeremiah to be a very credible witness.",
