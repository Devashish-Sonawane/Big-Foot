            "Follow-Up Report": "In addition to submitting a report, this witness called us. I returned his phone call and talked to him at length. He is retired, been in the Military, lived and hunted his entire life in Northern Michigan, and more recently has hunted in Florida during the Winter months.  He contacted us because he has never seen anything like this. He had stayed the weekend at his cabin in Curtisville and left early Labor Day morning to avoid traffic, returning to his home in Flint. It was daylight, there was fog, but the fog had lifted about 10 feet. He first saw the figure in the road on the left side from a 1/2 mile away, he thought it was a jogger getting ready to cross. As he got closer, he assumed the figure saw his car and headlights so it proceeded to cross, into the small grassy ditch and then the wood line that was about 10 feet from the road. When it moved he said it resembled a person in a ghillie suit.  The figure was thick and wide, and all black.  He knew it wasn't a bear because he figured once it started moving, especially when it went into the ditch, it should have gone down on all fours.  He slowed down to 5 mph as he passed the location, and to his surprise there was no trail or driveway. A hunter in a ghillie suit didn't make sense since it was not hunting season yet.  When I asked if he could take someone back to the exact location he said it would be difficult, because in this area where there are no driveways or houses, everything looks the same. This region has a strong history of Bigfoot sightings.  In 2011 a BFRO Expedition was held not far from this location, also in the Huron National Forest.",

The neighbor had been driving up to his house when he saw 'something big, and not an animal on his porch. That is was very large and hairy' and when his headlights hit it, the 'unknown creature' ran from the porch, heading towards the property of her father's shop, easily hopping over a six foot fence. The neighbor then called the father, who then got into his truck and sped towards his shop. He reported that he saw 'a large man-like creature' run away from the shop and leaped over a ten foot creek that made a 'grunt' sound when it landed on the other side.The neighbor found his wife, who was at home at the time, crying and shaking and pointing a pistol towards the door. She stated that she had heard something large jump onto her porch and was trying to pull on the screen porch door, making a 'popping' noise on the door. She screamed at the intruder to go away, but it continued to pull on the door until her husband's headlights appeared, then it left, running off towards the witness's property.",
