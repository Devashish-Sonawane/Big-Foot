            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness and he added the following information. The witness was hunting the 2008 Muzzle loader season and had been in the area 4 days prior to opening day on October 5th. His group had harvested a forked horn buck on October 3rd and seen many other bucks, elk and cattle in the area. His group was able to harvest a spike bull on the season opener. Early morning of October 6th around midnight the witness was awakened by the sound of loud wood knocks coming from the ridge across from camp. The witness stated the knocking had a distinct pattern and lasted for an hour with a twenty minute pause between three different knocking episodes. The witness said is sounded like someone was beating a Louisville Slugger bat against a tree. The witness woke his brother in the cot next to him as the second set of knocks started. His brother listened for a moment and sleepy stated it was strange, sounded like cows but went back to sleep immediately.  After the third set of knocks ended the witness was able to fall back asleep.That morning the group went out early to find the elk as they still had tags to fill.  What struck them as very odd was there were no animals in the immediate area. They could not find any deer, elk or cattle. The witness spoke to another group of hunters that morning camped 2 miles away. They reported that they had all kinds of deer, elk and cattle in their area on opening day and now they can't find a single animal. The witness did not share his wood knocking experience with the other group of hunters.",

I typically go hiking alone as it gives me opportunity to gather my thoughts and enjoy the outdoors. Seeing as how my wife\u0092s birthday was coming up she managed to convince me to take her and our two children along. I had planned a more arduous hike near Mt. St. Helens but given the children\u0092s notable lack of ambition and current weather conditions I elected to drive the hour and a half from our home in Castle Rock to Lake Cushman for a more \u0093family friendly\u0094 outdoor experience.",

            "Also Noticed": "Didn't take note of it until after the incident and we were heading back down the trail.....but along with the usual chewed stumps of mushrooms along the trail we found many uprooted with the tops bitten off. I found this unusual for a couple of reasons. First off deer and elk usually bite the tops off at ground level leaving the stump in the ground (of which we observed may). Secondly the uprooted stumps were in the middle of the trail and were left in almost a Hansel & Grettel manner. I collected and bagged one of these uprooted mushrooms. Not sure why...I just found it strange.",
