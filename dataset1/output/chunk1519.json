            "Observed": "I have had 2 experiences the first was in hunting season of 1995. While hunting with my friend out of a double tree stand my friend and I was waiting for our dad's to drive out the woods to us. At the same time a friend of ours was coming from around the opposite side of the hill. When he got to us we started to talk while waiting for our dad's to come through the woods. While we were talking we heard a very loud powerful scream come from the woods across the field from us. We had no idea what this could have been. Out of the three of us that witnessed this none of us had heard anything like that or wanted to go investigate what it was. We were scared even being armed with shotguns. Later we heard the ohio bigfoot recording howls and we agreed that it sounded identical. So we believe that we heard bigfoot years later.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I made contact through facebook and arranged to meet the witness at his home. I asked him if he realized he had made two reports of the same incident. He explained that the first time in 2012 when he hit the submit button his screen froze and he wasn't sure it went through. When no one contacted him, he submitted it again.We met around 5:00 in the afternoon , about 1500 yards from where the first incident occurred.  After getting a good layout of his family's farm, he took me through the experience he and two hunting companions had. The witness and a friend were situated in a ladder stand at the far end of a sloping wooded tract of land.Three hunters, his father and uncles, two on one side and one on the other, started to drive to them from the far end of the woods. The single driver reached him first. While waiting on his father and other uncle, a very close, very loud sound the witness described as a cross between a lions roar and a women screaming, came from the hollar just below them. The uncle, who weighed around 300 pounds, told them to make room for him cause he's coming up. The witness said the roar was so deep they could feel it in their bodies. When the other two hunters arrived, they had not heard the scream so they told them what happened and that there was something down in the hollar. The witness who was thirteen at the time told his dad he was done hunting for the day.The second incident happened about 8 years later and was within a mile of the 1995 incident.The witness and a friend were working on his friends wifes car and needed some parts. It was late and the fastest way to get there was by taking a couple dirt roads in order to arrive before the store closed. The roads took them through an old strip mined area that is now a Sportsmans Club. They came up out of a dip and into a curve in the road. The small headlights of their Ford Ranger lit up a large red haired body, standing about 12 feet off the drivers side of the dirt road.The headlights from the Ranger only lit up the midsection of his body from its chest to its knees. The witness, who was driving described the body as massive, it was a male, very wide shoulders, about 4 feet wide, his chest muscles were very visible and he had large muscular arms  that were at his sides. As he passed he hit his brakes and was going to back up. As he was doing this he asked his friend if he saw that. His friend replied yes,  just go...go....go. The witness did not get a look at its face but what he saw from the drivers seat of the Ranger, it had to have been 9 foot tall.We went to the location of the roadside sighting. The witness stood along side the road and had me stop where his best view was. After taking a picture, the distance from the truck to Bigfoot was 18 feet.I found the witness who is now in his late 30's to be very credible, i know his family and I am very familiar with this area. The area sits on the edge of a coal strip mine that closed in 1956. This area encompasses two Sportsmans Clubs and a State Forest, for a total of 19,000 acres of unclaimed strip pits, forest, ponds and fields including Cross Creek, a ten foot wide creek that flows for seven miles to the Ohio river.",

            "Observed": "On the morning of May 10th 2009 me and my friends were camping at my girlfriends house in Mechanicstown, Ohio. Mechanicstown is in Carrol County, just bordering Columbiana County. We were out @ about 3:00 in the morning trying to get the fire going in the back yard. As we were lighting the fire, I heard a loud howling coming over the hills. I stopped and asked my cousin if he heard the noise too. At first he acknowledged hearing the dogs barking off in the distance. However, he did notice the howling I was talking about. We both stood at the fire and listened to the howling continue for a couple of minutes. We are not from around this area, so he asked me what I thought it was that might be howling like that. I told him it was probably a bear...but it was still some distance away...my estimate being 4-5 miles. We brushed the noise off, and went back inside. The next morning i tried as best as i could to describe the sound to my girlfriends parents, who are residents of the area. They told me they dont know what i heard...but it did not seem to resemble a bear because bears in this area do not howl like that. The next day, I happened to be watching MonsterQuest on the History Channel. It was about Bigfoot legends from around the US and they happened to play a clip from a unknown howling recorded in Columbiana County, Ohio in 1994. As soon as I heard the howling...i recognized it. It was the EXACT same sound we had heard the night before. I decided to google Columbiana County, Bigfoot, 1994 and actually found the clip of the sound on this website. I listened to it...and am 100% positive that was the exact noise i heard. I sent the clip to my cousin, and he too confirmed that was the noise that he heard as well.",

Everyone else heard it too because it was so loud it interrupted our conversation.  The best way I could describe the noise is that it resembled the sound of a falling log. While we did have logs in the fire some distance away, they were all burned out. Everyone else heard the noise as well, and told me to stick my head out and look. I was scared, but did so anyway. The landscape was quite lit up from the full moon, but i didnt particularly notice anything strange. I actually looked at the fire because thats where i thought the noise came from. Seeing there were no logs made me really start to wonder. I did have to go back to the house because my tent had a problem, and upon leaving to go into the house, ended up running because i felt scared, like something was there.  The people who slept outside didnt notice anything else strange that night though.",
