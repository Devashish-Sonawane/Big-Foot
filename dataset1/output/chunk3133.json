            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this witness on the phone. Further details:  Witness returned to the foot print site on Sunday using a different route.  While en route witness stated that something big, escorted him through the woods to the site.  He said that it did not make any pretension of stealth and was in fact breaking branches along the way in a very loud manner.  He further stated that he found two new tracks near the original two reported.  One of the new tracks was fifteen inches in length. Inside the heel of that track was a very small track measuring two and one half inches in length.  The crashing of the branches and brush stopped and he noted that there was a large blackish hairy figure peeking from behind a tree across the creek about 100 feet away.  He could not identify features beyond that it was big and hairy.  Brush and trees obscured a clear view.  The growls began shortly there after in sets of two.  He described the growls as guttural and from deep inside of the chest.  One growl, then another was followed by five seconds of silence.  Then the pattern repeated.  The witness stated that he was not scared but got the message of \"I am here, and you better stay over there.\"   Finally he let out a whoop and everything went quiet.   The witness visits this site about two times a year leaving jars of unopened peanut butter taped to a tree as high as he can reach.  He has never found any trace of the peanut butter jar or tape upon his return.[Note from Matt Moneymaker: This witness provided lat/long coordinates. Based on those coordinates the zone he's describing is near the confluence of Wiggington Creek and Gasper River,  roughly 10 miles northeast of Russellville Kentucky, and 17 southeast of Bowling Green.He mentions vocalizations reported 10 to 12 miles north of that location. That area would be near the Gasper River also, so that is probably the stream it moves along, if it is still around there.  ",
