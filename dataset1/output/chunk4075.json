            "Observed.1  ": "On Wednesday, June 15, 2011, Michael Patrick\u0092s mother was getting the liner to her pool changed at her residence, when workmen noticed an abnormally large footprint under the apple tree in the back yard and brought the footprint to Patrick\u0092s attention. Over the years Patrick and his mother had, at times, heard bizarre noises, but had always passed them off as coming from some common forest animal. But they weren\u0092t the only ones that had heard the sounds either. The night before the footprint was found a neighbor had also commented about unusual sounds. \u0093My neighbor has a German Shepherd, and it heard something that night that spooked him. The dog went outside to investigate, but came back cowering, now it won\u0092t leave its owner\u0092s side,\u0094 Patrick said. Unsure about what exactly the footprint was, and concerned for his mother\u0092s safety, Patrick called the Chatham Police Department. An officer came to investigate the scene, but was unable to determine what might have caused the print. \u0093The responding officer stated that there was a large footprint approximately 18 inches long and 8 inches wide, and it appeared there were five claw marks,\u0094 Chatham Police Department Deputy Chief, Vernon Foli said. To give you an idea how big 18 inches is, retired NBA center Shaquille O\u0092Neil's feet are approximately 15 inches long, and he wears a size 23 shoe. The average human being\u0092s foot measures approximately 9 \u00bd inches. Most shoe size charts end at a size fifteen shoe. An 18-inch footprint is about the size of a healthy newborn baby. Considering the size of the print, it\u0092s understandable for a person to show a little concern if they found such a print in their yard. Patrick documented his discovery on Facebook where he struck up a conversation with a friend. Patrick\u0092s friend knew John Winterbauer, a Bigfoot investigator. Winterbauer in turn contacted local Bigfoot expert Stan Courtney. Courtney has documented sightings and gathered sound recordings and evidence of Bigfoot for years. He has interviewed over two hundred witnesses who have seen Bigfoot. \u0093I literally know hundreds of people who\u0092ve seen these animals. There have been lots of them in central Illinois. I\u0092ve recorded lots of sounds that other researchers and witnesses believe come from these animals. People in Springfield don\u0092t realize it, but there have been a lot of reports from the Sangamon River around Riverton.\u0094 Courtney said in a previous interview. Courtney said that there have been five to six other reports of finding footprints and howling in the Chatham area since June. So why is Bigfoot in Chatham? Well it\u0092s hard to say really. Patrick\u0092s property does back up to a wooded stream which flows into Lake Springfield. Courtney proposed that the creature was drawn to the house because of the apple tree that grows in Patrick\u0092s mother\u0092s back yard. Stan Courtney explained to Patrick that the apple tree might have somehow been interpreted as a gift of food. In the past the Patrick\u0092s had noticed that apples from the tree had been picked, but only to a certain height. They believed that the culprit was a wily raccoon, but the large footprint seemed to suggest otherwise. Courtney told Patrick that a creature such a Bigfoot will usually return the favor, and present a gift of its own as a show of appreciation in the form of a dead animal or a strange arrangement of flowers. The day after his meeting with Courtney, Patrick discovered the Sasquatch\u0092s gift, a decapitated rabbit, near his mother\u0092s house. In Courtney\u0092s account he stated that the rabbit had, \u0093its head pulled off, not bitten or cut, but just simply pulled off.\u0094 Since that strange June evening, no more incidents have occurred at Patrick\u0092s mother\u0092s residence. You might think that such a strange series of events would frighten most people in to staying out of the back yard, but the occurrence has not deterred Patrick\u0092s mother from going about her normal routine. \u0093She\u0092s not scared, she continues to do her yard work, she thinks it\u0092s neat. My mom has never been skeptical of it.\u0094 Patrick said. While his mother may not be skeptical of what happened, others aren\u0092t ready to pin the event on Bigfoot just yet. Vernon Foli posed a possible explanation, albeit an indirect one. \u0093One thing I can tell you is that approximately \u00bd mile south of this location is the former Grindstone Valley Zoo that use to have exotic animals. The zoo is no longer in existence but the owner is Brad or Larry Reynolds and he still has some animals at this location,\u0094 Foli said.  Could the print have come from an animal from the old zoo? The Reynolds had kept large animals such as buffalo, antelope, elk, deer, tigers, leopards, monkeys, and zebras while the zoo was open. Or could it be a bear footprint? It\u0092s widely believed by many that there are no bears in Illinois, but with their presence in neighboring states, Wisconsin and Missouri, would it be so far fetched to think that there are indeed bears in Illinois? At this point it\u0092s hard to tell what exactly made the footprint, but with other accounts of strange happenings and unusual howls and screeches in Chatham, many residents are raising an eyebrow. \u0093I definitely don\u0092t think it was a hoax, and it was more than just a coincidence. I think that people should just be a bit more vigilant and careful, because you never know what you\u0092re going to find out there,\u0094 Patrick said.",
