It closed in 2008 but building has been repurposed. As they headed down Holmes Rd. and were turning into the first curve in an S curve, they saw the creature. Witnesses car was heading East and the creature ran North towards the cemetery between a small patch of woods and the cemetery. Description of event: There was a \"low dense fog, around (human) calf height\". A nearly full moon plus his headlights gave ample lighting. 11 PM at night. Creature was 6-7 feet tall and was light brown to a dirty blond color. When first sighted they were about 100 feet away and they got as close as 50 feet before it disappeared near the cemetery. The \"arms were very long and hung well past the knees\". There was \"no hair on the face and the skin was a very dark tan or blackish in color\". The \"fingernails were long and appeared to be black\".The length of sighting was 10-12 seconds, as they had slowed to a crawl because of the curve and the number of passengers. When they all saw it, which was nearly instantaneous, there was \"screaming and mayhem\", which was another reason he slowed down and everyone got a good look.As he mentioned, they were \"freaked out\" and they sped past it and took another way home. This witness is retired military, and though this happened several decades ago, his recollection and attention to detail is what one might expect from a trained observer. He was not in the military at the time but he enlisted the following year. This is an active area 25 -35 miles south of Kansas City, Mo.",
