My dad did go outside to have a look, and there was a lingering foul odor in the air. We were raising chinchillas at the time, and they have a foul odor to begin with so my dad just thought it was from them (they were in a building only 15 feet from the door). The next day however, we could see were something had moved through the field towards the trees. The grass was over a foot tall, and there was a definite trail that could be seen. There were no footprints---I think because of the length of the grass that was tromped down.",
