            "Follow-Up Report": "I met the witness at his family reunion on Green Mountain, which happened to be about three miles from my home.        The witness and I traveled with his brother to the site of his 1949 experience.  The witness immediately recognized the spot where he saw the creature, though the road was now paved and houses had been built in what was deep forest then.  He and his brother showed me the site of their uncle's house.  He described leaving the uncle's house and walking to the gravel road.  After a short walk, he saw the animal up ahead near the crest of the next hill, a distance of about 70 yards.  The animal was standing in the ditch by the side of the road.  He stated the animal was between 7 and 8 feet tall.  It had \"long hair, 3 or 4 inches in length,\" and was \"red-looking.\"  At first the animal faced the road.  Then it turned to the right to look at him. At this point he ran back to get his uncle.  When he returned with his uncle, the animal was still there watching.  As they proceeded down the road with the gun, they lost sight of it.  When they got to the spot where the animal had stood, they saw no trace of it. The witness had other information to add to the description of  vocalizations that the aunt heard.  In addition to screams, the witness said his aunt also heard odd sounds, or \"mumblings,\" as something scratched along the windows at night.  The brother substantiated these comments.  The witness is certain of what he saw, and stands by his statement. ",

My girlfriend grabbed my arm in fear. We were confronted by a large creature crossing the road. The creature turned and stared, it had ice blue eyes, was about seven and half feet tall. I guess it weighed maybe 350 to 450 lbs.  It took two steps to cross the road, pausing to look half way. This was in 1973, I believe the area is now known as Panthertown valley.
