            "Observed": "While camping in the White Mountains of NH in March 2001, I came across bi-pedal prints in heavy snow.  Each foot print was about 18 inches long by 8 inches wide, and the stride was 24 to 30 inches between each print.  They were located in 100-150 yards off a snowmodible trail, and went even deeper.  This was were I was camping for 3 days, so I did not want to pay attention.  However, after considerable thought about the circumstances, my observations of the environment make the tracks interesting.  In march of 2001, there was fairly heavy snows, ranging from 3 to 4 feet deep.  The week before the camping trip was very warm, so the snow began to melt.  There was stil snow, so when it got cold again the next week, there was an inch or so of ice on top of the snow.  When wearing snowshoes, the weight dispersal would break the ice in a large cricle, simply caving in some of the ice.  When wearing snow boots, the ice could not support your weight on such a small area, and your foot would go straight through the ice.  Applying this to the prints, there was no evidence that the prints were made before the snow melt, as they then would have exihibted the melted ice over the print.  There was no way these could have been made by snowshoes then (they wouldnn't even be the same shape) and it was way to big to be anybodies boot that would make this kind of straight through the ice print.  There were no distinctivly human markings ( i.e. ice breakers or tread marks).  My only regreat was not following them",

The submitter did not note if the tracks were deeper than his own at the time.The submitter has recontacted the BFRO via the website in regards to his observation and estimate of the depth. the pertinent part of the  reply is as follows.\"Since there was a melt, and thus a layer ice on top of the snow, when walking with your boots, you would make astraight, exact print through the ice, but only the first layer. There were other ice layers with snow in between, and the tracks that I found definetly went through the second ice sheet, and possibly the third. So as I don't know the exact depth, I would estimate 10 to 14 inches (i know thats a big gap) but the pertinent point is that they broke through lower sheets of ice that would support me on my boots. I know this is not the most important sighting or anything, but i just wanted my only info I can give to be more complete.\"",

            "Observed": "From 1997~ 2003 I lived in Snohomish, Washington, located near the top of Cathcart Hill which I think is about 350 ft  above sea level, maybe higher. It also was all forested west of there for 5 square miles until they developed it all over a short period of time.  Now it is only forested to the east. I had heard many calls during the development of all the land near me. I suspected Bigfoot but didn't know what it sounded like at the time. Also, a strange thing happened around my house. When I smoked outside at night I would hear what sounded like an elephant smashing through the ten feet tall blackberry bushes towards me. It scared a friend if mine so bad when he went outside to pee and it screamed a blood curdling scream from the bushes. So these things happened for years.  Then one night I came around the corner driving north on Snohomish Ave. towards my road coming home with a friend and right before my road there was a swamp, I came around the bend and saw eye shine so I slowed to a crawl so not to hit what it was. Then I inched closer and it came across the road, I thought it was a pony at first then I saw its size was disproportionate. Its back end was taller than the front.on all fours. It turned and looked at us right before it went into the darkness and I thought its face reminded me of a sloth. I still didn't know what I'd seen. It wasn't dark brown. It was a light color like grey or maybe white. Then I pulled forward and my friend and I rolled down the side window and tried to see where it went and we smelled a strong sulfur smell, but we couldn't see anything and we got scared and went home. I tried to look up if we have some species of giant sloth in Washington. Now days I've been better educated about Bigfoot from watching shows on TV and I'm very sure that is what we saw that night. My friend was convinced it was Bigfoot that night but I wasn't sure because it was on all 4's & wasn't brown or black. Now I know, that its the only thing it could've been. I think it was running out of habitat and with many other wildlife was driven east thru that neighborhood. It's unknown if it is there still as I moved a long time ago and haven't felt stalked since.",
