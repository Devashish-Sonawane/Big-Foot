            "Observed": "My husband and 2 sons and I lived in Emporia. Through our church my husband had become involved with the scout program. They were having a weekend campout and awards ceremony maybe 50 +/- miles East of Emporia. He called about 10:00p.m. saying he had forgotten the awards and asked me to bring them to him. I left about 10:40 and went East out of Emporia on (I think) highway US 50. Shortly after passing what I believe was called Beto Junction I turned South and curved around to the East as it was supposed to be the shortest route. The road had no shoulders and was filled with pot holes forcing me to go at a very slow rate of speed, no more than 30 miles per hour and slowing further than 30 at times. I had gone only a few miles  when I saw movement to my right side about 50 feet ahead. Thinking it was deer I slowed to almost a crawl partly due to the road condition as well. What I saw was not a deer but something walking quickly in an upright position to the fence. The creature just lifted the right leg (it was facing me) and stepped over the barbed wire, took a couple steps and was in the road. I came to a complete stop being only 20? feet away from this creature. It stood in the middle of the road with my lights on it. It looked at the car and I looked at it. I opened my door and stepped out keeping the door in front of me and we looked at one another for what seems like a full minute. Visually, the creatures form was maybe 7 feet, hair covering the body, not being short like fur but generally 2-3 inches on most of the body.   There was hair covering on the chest area but much more sparse. It seemed to be uniformly porportionate with the arms being the only exception and that was minor. One other thing visually, the eyes appeared to be red and almost glowed red on their own and not as reflection might produce.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.The witness stated that the animal was very heavily built in the upper body with dark chestnut brown hair.  The hair was somewhat thinner on the chest than the rest of the body.She said that the arms were longer in proportion than a human's would be by about six inches.  It appeared to have a short neck.    She was very impressed by the fact that the eyes appeared to be sofly glowing red.  She also felt a sense of calm with no feelings of aggression when she stepped out of the car. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.While hunting, she found impressions in the frozen dirt of two different sized, flatfooted tracks, some with five toes. Both tracks were on the same trail. The larger track was two inches wider and two to three inches longer than her size nine boot. The smaller track was about the same size as her boot. No claw marks were seen. She found four of the larger tracks with two to three showing five toes. The tracks were found within a distance of thirty to forty feet. The distance between each track was farther than the witness could step. She found six to seven smaller tracks, one with five toes. These tracks also covered thirty to forty feet distance with about thirty inches between tracks. On November 15, 2016 in this same area, she found another track and knuckle prints in the mud. The track was about the same size as her boot, with five toes, and 1/4\" deep. Above it, as if pulling itself up a bank, was a partial hand print with knuckles also 1/4\" deep in the mud. The knuckles were double in size to hers. Her husband mentions this in Report 56270.The witness hunts this area often and enjoys looking at wildlife tracks. I find her very credible.   ",
