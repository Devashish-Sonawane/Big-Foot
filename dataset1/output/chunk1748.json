            "Observed": "We were sitting around a campfire in our yard with our 3 dogs, when we heard coyotes howling-- nothing unusual.  We see tracks and hear them frequently.  The coyotes were howling and were then joined by a lower, deeper howl.  We assumed that it might be a wolf joining in the howling, but authorities deny there are wolves in Illinois, too.  We are experienced outdoor people.  We do a lot of hiking and outdoor activities.  We frequently spend time in northern Wisconsin and have seen and heard wolves in the wild.  This scared us so badly that we went back to the house.  So, we didn't see anything, just the vocalizations.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.In summary:\u0095 The vocalization was much deeper and louder than a coyote. \u0095 At about the same time the family was awakened at 2 a.m. by something that banged two or three times on the outside wall of the house.  \u0095 The house has a five foot chain link fence that totally surrounds the home. It has been noticed that in two areas it has been mashed down as if something very heavy had been crashing into or climbing over the fence.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness after seeing his post on a bigfoot message board inquiring about sightings in northern Colorado.The witness, a 41-year-old man, is an emergency services professional in a large Front Range city. He said he hasn't told anyone about his sighting for fear of damaging his reputation at work. He has still not even told his family about the incident.In the following excerpts of an interview conducted in February, he describes further details about the sasquatch. \"What I remember first was just the size of the thing. It was standing up on two legs, but I was so close it was obvious right away that it wasn't a bear. The other thing that freaked me out was the length of its arms. It had long arms that hung down way past where a human's would be. \"The amount of time I looked at it is hard to estimate, maybe 8-12 seconds, but I had ample time to look at it and eliminate things. \"I didn't see its feet initially. What I did see was knees, legs, the torso, arms and head. Then it turned, and I got to see its backside and the bottoms of feet.\"First of all, this thing's big. I was alone. I didn't know what it was going to do. So when it got out of crouch and turned to walk away, I felt relief. It would be the same thing if you saw a bear. \"I briefly thought maybe I should follow it, then I reconsidered the size and said that's stupid. \"It had glossy black or really dark brown fur, or I should say hair. The face was remarkable. This fall, I went to the zoo with my daughter and one of her friends and kind of lingered around the ape habitat. They had a gorilla there and there were a lot of similarities - a lot. I would say the face is not quite as protruding as a gorilla's. I could see the nostrils were wide. It was a pretty distinguishing feature. I'd put it more in the ape camp than the human camp. There wasn't a big bridge or a point to the nose. It was rather flat.\"There was maybe even a little bit more hair around its head . Some of things I read about bigfoot described a dome-shaped head -- that's a good adjective - where a gorilla's head comes to a sharp point. The arms of a gorilla are long, so was this thing's. My impression, and again I'm reaching back,  I'd say its arms were a little thinner than a gorilla. I didn't think it had huge big hands. I would think the gorilla's hands bigger and stronger. \"The legs were long, but the butt didn't stick out like gorilla's. The posture, that's kind of the freakiest thing. It had a straight back. It was standing up, walking on two legs. You're  just not prepared to see that kind of thing. \"The only noise I recall is when it stood to get up it made a huffing that came from a very large set of lungs.\"The one thing that I find completely strange is that something that size could find food and habitat without it becoming common knowledge. Because if I've seen it, someone else has to have seen it. I can go sometimes years without seeing a bear, but I see bear sign all the time. The same with elk. If there were people looking for these things, I can't understand why no one would have found one.\"But if there's one thing I can impress upon you, it's this: You're not pursuing a ghost, or a boogie man.''",
