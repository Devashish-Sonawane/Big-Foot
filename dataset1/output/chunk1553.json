But I have never forgot what I saw. It was strong and tall but not real tall.  Maybe six foot ten to seven feet tall. It had a smell to him I will never forget. I knew he was still there down in the hollow where I was raised as a child. When we would cut firewood in the saw mill he would make us feel weird like he didn't want us there. My mom would say start the truck and don't stop until we get to the top of the ridge. We found footprints one winter that were very wide at the heel and very large in size like 17-20 inches long. I hope someone hears what I have to say. I would love to talk to someone about this. I know he is still there! It's a perfect place for him to live with so much forest and hills.",
