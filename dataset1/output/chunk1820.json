            "Follow-Up Report": "After a lengthy telephone conversation with the witness, and a separate conversation with his daughter, the following details may be added to his report:-At the point of closest approach the creature was about 30 feet from the witness. When his daughter looked up to see why the car was slowing down, the creature was standing directly in front of the vehicle.-In the headlights the creature appeared completely covered in dark brown, matted hair.-The witness estimates its height was 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall. His daughter believes it was shorter, between 6 and 7 feet.-Both the witness and his daughter observed the creature walking on two legs during the entire encounter, at no time did it drop to all fours.-When the creature paused in the road and turned toward the vehicle, the witness felt their eyes meet. In that look he registered a presence more substantial than just an animal, as he would expect from a bear or deer.-To the observer, the creature seemed self aware, in control of its actions, and unruffled by the situation. The daughter believes it was trying to figure out if they were a threat to it.-The creature did not flee from the encounter, but quickly and casually walked south into the tree line. It moved with purpose, as if it were \"on a mission\".-The creature was described as bulky, large chested, muscular and with long legs. The arms appeared proportionate to the daughter, but the father can not recall as his focus was on the creature's head. Neither witness could describe specific details of the face, but are confident that it did not resemble a bear's face, nor was it obviously human. The daughter reports being so frightened during the event that she was unable to focus closely on the creatures face.-The witness can not put a name to what he saw, but he knows it was definitely not a bear. He and his daughter have shared their encounter with friends and family over the years, and he believes they may have seen a sasquatch.It is worth noting that a significant number of credible reports come from encounters in close proximity to large military bases. Often these areas are posts or bases with extensive and largely undeveloped training grounds. These regions are typically off limits to civilians, and military access is usually routine and concentrated in specific ranges. Where this occurs it creates an environment suitable to a small sasquatch population, where food, water, shelter, and relative seclusion may be found. Examples of reports close to, or on, military installations include: 2218, 25559, 4109, 5381, 5463, 17089, 4421, 5395, 4886, 11930, 28197, 18680, 679, 7211, 2816",

            "Observed": "Hi, I am a Corporal police officer in central Missouri. I have had two accounts with bigfoots. First I was night fishing with my uncle when a large hairy thing came down a huge bluff making tons of noise I hit it with a spotlight across the river. The figure was crouched down on the bank looking and rocking side to side. I could not make out a face though. I shut the light off asked my uncle \"what is that?\" he didn't reply. I heard a second one coming down the bluff crashing and bashing. I hit the light again, I couldn't see the other one at that time. I heard a splash as the first bigfoot jumped in water 5 or 6 foot deep and the water was about the bottom of the rib cage. I turned to my uncle who took off running as I followed not looking back.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness on two separate days due to his work schedule. My partner and fellow investigator Brian Woods actually traveled to his location on the weekend of June 19. It is apprx. 265 miles south of Kansas City.Former military and current law enforcement. Date of the first incident, with his uncle was, July of 2013, and somewhere between 1 & 2 AM in the morning at Spring Creek. They had been fishing a couple of hours at the opposite bank of the sighting. They heard a loud ruckus up on the short bluff across the creek. Sounded like something was falling or crashing through the brush on the way down to the creek. They hit the area with a spotlight. As stated, the first creature was crouching down at the shoreline by a large stump. At the moment they saw it, another creature came tumbling/crashing down the hill/bluff, and they hit that area with a spotlight. Saw nothing, but \"knew\" it was another creature. Same ruckus.As soon as they hit that area with the spotlight, they heard a large splash, and then refocused the spotlight in the general area where they saw the first creature crouched down. It had entered the water, and was standing in 5-6 feet of water. As stated, the water came to the bottom of its rib cage. This would make it in the neighborhood of 7.5-8 ft. tall minimum. It was dark brownrown. He stated \"it blended perfectly with vegetation/stump\" at the first initial sighting before they refocused the light up the bank. When they then refocused the lamp back on the first one that was now standing in the water, it became \"unmistakably clear\" what they were looking at. The distance was appx. 45 yards to the other side of the creek, and the entire duration of time was 30-60 seconds before they took off running and never looked back. Witness stated it \"seemed like forever\". I have included a map of general location, indicated by marker CR217. Also, here is a photo of river area of sighting.Photo of unusual structure found nearby. We also found numerous other \"structures, and or potential structures\" very close by. 20 plus. The inclusion of other structure photos does not insinuate the creatures in his account made these, but would tend to bolster the impression that the area is very conducive to \"other\" upright bipedal activity. Photos of possible structures:The second event with his wife took place in May of 2014. They were taking an early morning walk at 8AM on a clear spring morning. As he stated, they heard the \"cow (bull) growl\" from a good distance away, and had estimated it was 3 pastures away, across a road and three fences. They heard it 2-3 more times until the last \"growl\" was about 50 yards away or less. They could \"feel\" the growl this time. This is when his military and law enforcement training of \"fight or flight\" kicked in. He drew his pistol as his wife huddled behind him. They stood their ground and waited for the ten minutes stated. They knew they were in the \"presence of something huge and possibly threatening\". After waiting a bit, they turned around and left the way they came. They never saw any creature, but \"felt its presence and knew they were being watched\". Updated 6/22/18: Location of river sighting was Pulaski County, not Rawls.",
