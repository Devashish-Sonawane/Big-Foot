            "Observed": "My dog had come up missing and I heard him barking far away and kept on calling him.   We lived in a very wooded area, so his barking was hard to hear.   When I found him, he was on a beaver  dam in the middle of a pond.  I never told this to anyone, not even my wife.  It just seemed so unreal.  When I saw my dog, he was looking to his right and that is when I saw a figure some seven to eight feet tall.   it stood there for what seemed minutes, but was most likely only seconds.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke via telephone to the witness.   He sounded sincere and did not want to elaborate any more than what he actually seen.   He stated that while looking for his dog, which ran into the woods, he came upon the pond which his dog was standing on top of on the ice,  which was thin and starting to crack.   His dog was frantically whining and barking.   The witness looked and seen what at first appeared to be dark bushes, but the more he looked at it, it appeared to be the outline of a person.   He only looked at it for 5 to 10 seconds at a distance of approximately 40 feet.   The area was very dense thickets and brush.   After a few seconds, the figure turned and took two steps and disappeared into the brush.   At first the witness was not sure what he had seen and he described himself as an avid hunter that is familiar with all local wildlife. When it turned he could make out a shoulder, one arm and the head.   At first he thought it may have been a hunter in camo, but the size, along with the dark color and the fact that they did not say anything, made him think otherwise.  The sheer size made a person seem unlikely.  He then retrieved his dog from the frozen pond and went back to the spot of the sighting.   His dog refused to go near the spot. The woods and pond are behind a large orchard of apple and peach trees with dense brush, creeks and ponds.   The witness said there are large populations of deer and turkeys in the area.",

We had set up for the night around 11:00 pm. We were all sitting around the campfire. I was telling a story about a recent trip  at the same location where me and my coworkers had heard a very loud scream that sounded like a woman being murdered.  No sooner did I finish the story that we heard the howl or scream. The husband and two boys looked at me and were not very happy. They thought I was playing a prank on them. To this day I am certain what we were hearing was a Bigfoot.",

After that camping trip I asked the owners to not send me out on anymore trips because I was too scared.",

I plan to visit the area when weather and snow levels allow in late spring. As she stated in her report, she and other colleagues at the ranch (M Lazy C Ranch) heard the same extremely loud and unusual screaming calls only a few days before. She stated that the screams were very loud and powerful, not like any other animal calls she had ever heard in the area.  The witness was a long-time Colorado resident at the time of the report, and very familiar with the local wildlife and their calls.  The screams were so loud and close to the witnesses in both cases as to cause feelings of extreme fear and confusion.I am very familiar with this area of central Colorado, and the report area is close to several other documented and anecdotal reports.",
