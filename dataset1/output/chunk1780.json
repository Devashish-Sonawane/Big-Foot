            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness at length on the phone.  The witness surmised that the initial tree limb snap was a warning, and that something wanted them to know that they were not alone.  Upon questioning, the witness was insistent that it was not a wood knock as described in countless other stories.  This was an actual huge tree limb snapping.  After the snap, his party moved down the trail, where a log was hurled at them.   He described the log that was thrown as being about 3 feet long and thick.  It rolled once landing near his friend.  The limestone was a slab approximately 3 feet long also.  It barely missed his friend.  The witness said that it would take 2 people to lift that rock and probably three to toss it.  He added that the slab had \u0093pretty good air\u0094 under it so he surmised it had been thrown far and high.  The witness does not live in the area, but the people he rides with say that whenever they go riding at this location, something always happens.  And it always happens as they are leaving.Editor's note:  Something very similar happened on BFRO West Virginia Expedition, October 2006",

I decided I wanted to turn around and not go all the way down to the sort yard. So I pulled into a turnaround. I had the car lights on. Just in the bushes on the other side of the road, I noticed some movement. I thought it might have been a deer, so I stopped the car. The first thing I really saw was really bright blue eyes. Then I noticed how far up they were, the thing had to be about 8-9 feet tall. The rest of the thing was real dark, might have been black or dark brown. My daughter saw the feet....they were huge. When I realized it might be a bigfoot, I freaked out and tore out of there. I've never been down there after dark again. I rarely go there at all. It didn't move after the initial movement we saw, it just stood there looking at us.",
