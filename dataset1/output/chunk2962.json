            "Follow-Up Report": "Stephen was 9 years old at the time of the encounter in the early summer of 1997. They were camped away from the main campground and near a clearing surrounded by trees and at the bottom of a hill. Stephen was awakened in the early morning hours by his brother\u0092s pet rat that they had brought along and was sharing their tent. He sat up to put the rat back in its cage when he heard what sounded like footsteps outside his tent. He looked out the door screening and saw a very tall, broad shouldered silhouette of a man- like figure standing approximately eight to ten feet away and slightly to his left.  It looked like it had been walking in a right to left direction, midway between his tent and his parents.  It was standing completely still, in a frozen semi-walking and hunched forward pose. Although there was adequate moonlight, he could not make out any facial details but he thought it was looking at him. It appeared to be about 7ft tall, the head was described as egg shaped coming to a blunt point near the top and flat on the front, the shoulders were very wide and heavy looking.  The arms were held in a swing position with the left arm forward and the right back.  The forearms appeared to be unusually long. The legs looked very thick and heavy, particularly in the thighs. There was a breeze and he noticed hair moving all over the body, which was a uniform dark coloration.  After what seemed like two minutes of staring at each other the figure turned its shoulders and upper body then the hips and legs following with the momentum and proceeded to walk back in the direction it was coming from, towards the clearing.  Stephen lost sight of it quickly as it passed beyond his tent door. No unusual odors were detected but it was breezy at the time. Stephen was very scared and didn\u0092t wake anyone but told his family the next morning. After speaking with Stephen and his Parents on the phone I was impressed this young man had seen something unusual that morning.  He was well spoken and polite.  The description Stephen gave of its movement, turning to leave is similar to other eyewitness accounts like BFRO Report #1760 for example.The Pike National Forest has a long history of reports and sightings including these BFRO reports:   Report #3588Report #819Report #1375Report #1376Report #880Report #7225",
