            "Observed": "10 of us rented a cabin in the woods Thursday Oct 29th thru Sunday Nov 1st. It was located in Logan Ohio part of Hocking Hills area. Everything was normal till Friday. We all started smelling a nasty smell couldn't figure out where it was coming from. Didn't smell it in the cabin just outside. Late Friday night after midnight 2 people were on the deck and everyone else went to bed. They started hearing loud noises like branches breaking and felt like they were being watched. Sometimes it sounded like something was being thrown they thought it was one of us pranking them. Then came a loud bang near them so they ran in the cabin from the upper deck. The one guy came into my room and told me what was going on. So me and another girl went down to the kitchen area and we all started looking out the windows. I turned all the lights out. Within minutes the one girl yelled there it is. I went to the kitchen window and in the field right in front of me there stood a large black figure walking on two feet towards the cabin. We all started yelling what is that. It then all of a sudden turned and went back into the woods it came out of like it heard us. We then got everyone up we all went out on the deck and heard weird howling sounds that none of us have heard before. And loud noises like branches breaking. Then we heard the loud sounds in front of the cabin to the left. We all moved to the front and heard walking and branches breaking and seeing something moving around. That is where a footprint was found.",

Four people actually saw the figure on the 31st in full moonlight.The next day Debbie had her six foot tall son stand where the figure walked in the field. She says the figure was much larger. ________________________________RE Update 11/08/20:  The location is in Perry County, not Logan County.",
