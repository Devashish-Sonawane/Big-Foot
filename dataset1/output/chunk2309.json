            "Observed": "I was deer hunting in the Rifle River State Park in Michigan. I was on the west border of the park about 300 yards from the southern border. I had walked into the area from the south and stopped to \"let the forest quiet\". I watched as three female deer crossed my path about 75 yards north of me. They were stopping and looking back to the west as they moved to the east. I thought that a buck would be sure to follow. What I saw was a figure that walked silently through the woods. It seemed to be a very large man in a fur coat. I thought,what a fool to be out in the woods in a fur coat and no hunter's orange during deer season! I had on an orange hunting coat and hat. As I stood up, the \"man\" turned to face me. It was then that I realized that this may not be a man. It turned and ran in the direction that it had come. I could not believe how quiet it ran through the woods.",

There were only two bedrooms in the back of the house, which were claimed by my parents and younger brother.  I was happy enough with a \"study\" in the front of the house, which had very large windows on two sides, practically covering the entire wall area.  Because of the unusual size and shape of the windows, we didn't have anything immediately to cover them, but we weren't concerned because we were in a secluded area off the road and woods all around.  Also, the front side of the house where my room was located, was on a slope, so no one could walk right up and actually see into my room without a ladder.  When I woke up that first morning in my new room, I was excited to see the beautiful layer of snow all around the wooded yard.  I was startled, though, to see a set of footprints coming from the back of the house, from the woods.  The footprints came up along the side of the house and then circled around to my front window.  I told my parents immediately, and my dad went out to investigate.  The footprints were huge, like twice the size of my dad's foot in width and almost twice as big in length.  My dad dismissed it as someone walking through the woods with boots on and not worried because the windows were too high for someone to see into.  The shape was not right for a boot, though.",
