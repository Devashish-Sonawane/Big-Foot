She did not see it leave the road and did not come back to look for other evidence. She also mentioned that their car had just run out gas and they had switched to a small reserve tank to get it started.I found the witness to be sincere and very sure of details of the encounter that happened many years ago.Although this area is now very developed, I have spoken with other witnesses and investigated other reports of encounters near this location. Some of these encounters have occurred more recently. See report #27564.",
