            "Follow-Up Report": "[Investigated by Steve Moon. Comments edited by Matt Moneymaker]I interviewed this witness by phone. He was not able to see the face of the animal. The hair was an auburn color, and matted. Witness did not see the animal walk away, but heard it leave. Witness had jumped back into the creek bed he had climbed out of when he walked up on the animal, and heard it get up and move away quickly. When it did so it made a sort of growl or snort, sounding like heavy breathing more than anything else, and seemed to move as though not in a hurry. Witness states that in about 1983 a buddy was deer hunting in the NW corner of the Dekalb hunting area when he drove up to a sasquatch standing behind a corner post. As he backed his truck away from the creature it walked away. The creature was about his own height, or about 6 feet tall. Witness has been hunting this area for about thirty years and is very in tune with the environment there. After speaking with the witness about this incident, I concluded that he is a credible observer.The Dekalb Wildlife Management Area is 21,070 acres, about three quarters of which is timber. There are two streams that bisect the area, numerous inactive rock quarries, and at least one large spring. ",

            "Observed": "I am 21 years old, live in Eatonville, Wa, under Mt. Rainier, have been researching the Sasquatch phenomenon since I was 7 or 8 years old, and this is the first encounter of any kind I've ever had. I was laying down to sleep on Sept. 29(my room and window faces the woods) when I heard the first of a series of vocalizations. First, I heard a distant call. It sounded kinda deep and man-like. Then, about 20 minutes later, the neighbors dogs on the other side of the 5 acres of woods between us started losing their minds and barking their heads off, and almost immediatly, I heard 4 or 5 siren-like calls(think of the vocalization that you hear on the 1994 A&E Bigfoot documentary). Very loud, very clear. From the 3rd call on, they faded as whatever made them seemed to be heading back deeper into the woods. Then, about 10 to 15 minutes later, the dogs went off again and I heard this chatter-like vocals, almost threatening sounding. It seemed to have a variation of sounds within the chatter. Like a mix between human-like barks/grunts, and an indescribable chattering that I just cannot explain. It did this for a few minutes, off and on. Seemed like it was taunting the dogs. And finally, it made a few fading groans as it seemed to head back to the deeper woods for the last time. And that was the last I heard of it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness over the phone, and then later at his home.   I also spoke to his parents.  We walked through the woods next to his home and to where the vocalizations originated.  There are many game trails, running mainly north-south, leading from the river to the south, to the fields around a small lake to the north.  These trails are visible in Google Earth images.  The ground is very wet with standing water, and the brush is quite thick in most places.  There were the tracks of probably 10 elk which had been there just that morning.  The witness is very familiar with the vocalizations of elk, having lived in the area all his life. The sounds he described were not elk calls.  Also, an elk would not have moved back and forth, toying with the dogs.  The activity went on for about an hour and a half.  He got the feeling that it was toying with the dogs that live on the nearby property.  The witness heard siren like screams. The vocalizations would come and go as the creature left and returned repeatedly. The creature seemed to be 100-200 yards away.  In addition to the screams, there was a weird \"chatter\" with tongue clicking sounds mixed in. The tongue clicking was very rapid. He said it was weird and out of this world.  The sounds mesmerized him, they were so unusual. I found his report of \"chatter\" does not fit with any known wild animal in the area. I believe that the circumstances, location, description of the vocalizations and the behavior make it most likely that the witness heard a sasquatch.  This photo, looking south, shows one of the trails.  This photo shows a swampy trail in heavy brush.This photo is of an impression in the trail in the above photo. ",
