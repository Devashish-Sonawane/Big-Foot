This home is located about four miles from the 1980 sighting detailed in this report. She and my grandfather went out on the front porch late one night and saw a creature standing in the edge of the woods near the house. They could only see its chest and arms in the shadows. She said it was tall and hairy. My grandfather yelled at the creature and it ran back into the wood towards a stream and made a great deal of noise thrashing through the trees and brush. She said they did find some strange \u00933 toe\u0094 footprints the next day. But, they never had another encounter with the creature after this incident.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "When I spoke to the gentleman about the brief sighting he and his family had many years ago I was impressed with the detail he was able to recall. The sighting area was a sparsely populated rural area.Witness stated that the approximate height of the animal to be over 7 feet tall, with dark brown/black hair in color.  The creature must have already crossed the road, and was heading in the direction of the wood line when he was caught in the headlights.  As the witness stated when the headlights were shined on him \"he\" froze in mid-stride for several minutes.  The witness seemed very credible and sincere.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Additional note by editor Matt MoneymakerAs the witness mentioned, this area is still very forested, as can be seen in Google map imagery (area east of Clayton, Alabama).The incident location appears to be a classic habitat for sasquatches in the eastern U.S., judging by the aerial images alone.The area is mostly forest, interspersed with cultivated fields that  attract deer herds.  There are multiple unexposed water sources nearby. There's also a power line route connecting various fields that would be used by deer.Sightings and encounters near Martin Pond could be expected, even today -- because it's an unexposed water source close to a power line route through a heavily forested area that is dotted with grazing fields.  Transient deer will move along that power line route and provide reliable ambush opportunities for a predator, especially in the late Summer and early Fall.",
