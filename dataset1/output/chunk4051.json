            "Observed.1  ": "Yes, Virginia, there really is a Sasquatch.  According to a friend, who I'll simply call R.P. (he still wants to remain anonymous, even after all these years), Sasquatch is more than just a fantasy. Nearly 25 years ago, he saw the elusive, big, hairy, ape-like creature we commonly call \"Big Foot.\"  R.P. and Jeff Greenway (now deceased) headed to Capitol Lake at about 11 p.m. with bows and arrows in hopes of securing a goose to barbecue. There were no geese, but there was a solitary figure that made them scurry for cover. The two watched as the figure came toward them, taking loping strides of approximately 5 feet in length.  As it came closer, the boys saw it was about 9 feet tall, weighed between 300 and 500 pounds and had shoulders that were almost 4 feet wide.  Its body was covered with 4 to 6 inches of dark brown hair that went over its head, down its short neck, onto its back and hung down under long arms that reached well below its knees. It moved humped over, with knees bent.  The hairy figure moved quickly along the area between the Westside Bridge and the elegant brick house built alongside the railroad tracks, then made its way across the Parkway and toward the lake. It continued toward the Marathon Park's lit facilities by the lake, where the boys were hiding motionless behind a small tree. R.P. thinks the creature smelled their presence because it suddently pivoted and hurried back to the Parkway road.  When it reached the high bank next to the road, the huge creature was up and over it with only one and a half strides.  The figure disappeared into the woods, leaving no tracks that the boys could find when they searched the following day.  The two didn't broadcast their terrifying experience, however. When the boys' families wouldn't believe their tale, R.P. and his friend decided to keep the story to themselves.  However, they shouldn't have been too shy about telling their story about seeing a great hairy beast. Over the years it's been seen and identified by several names: Big Foot, Ape Man, Sasquatch, Abominable Snowman, Evil Genii, Skookums.  During 1847, it was spotted by Mount St. Helens Indians and also by early miners, then old-timers near Oakville reported seeing it in 1912, and many others after that.  So, R.P., you and Jeff weren't the only ones who saw the hairy figure skulking through the woods around Washington. There are those who would believe your tale and become believers in the great Sasquatch. ",
