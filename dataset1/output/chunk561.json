He said it sounded like an owl, but not an owl. I thought he was being silly and ignored it. About 2 weeks ago my husband and I were getting home from a date night (1230 am or so) and I heard the most terrifying sound. It was a shriek similar to the one the female on the Bigfoot hunter show has made (not exactly same but close enough to raise the hair on my back) .My husband said \"that's it! Did you hear it??\" I tried to stay calm and told him it was probably some kids joking around. I didn't want to tell him what I really thought. I've been woken several times since by the same scream and a few nights ago I woke to what sounded like rocks being thrown at our house. I was too scared to look out the window. This was supposed to be our dream home and now I'm terrified to go in our backyard.not sure what to do. If there is some way to get rid of it or make it move on I'd love to know how.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness lives on a recently purchased 5 acre property near Issaquah. The witness was informed of the BFRO List of Sound Recordings and identified the screams as exactly like the Puyallup and Snohomish screams. Since that night the witness has heard several screams usually late at night and thought that she heard rocks or pebbles being thrown at her window. While talking to the witness by phone she later stated that the night of the rock throwing incident actually started after her 2 year old child was awakened by the now familiar screaming. The screams originate from the wildlife preserve that the house backs into, and both the master bedroom and the child's room have windows that overlook the backyard. After comforting the crying child the witness returned to her bedroom and then heard what she thought was tapping on the windows. She stated earlier that she thought it was rocks but now thinks it could have been a finger- like tapping on her window. The witness stated that when the house was sold an 80 foot long piece of fencing was missing and could not be fixed until the summer. The witness did not want to start any interaction and we discussed her being afraid for the safety of her family. I suggested fixing the fence and installing more lighting on the property.",
