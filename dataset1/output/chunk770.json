Our dogs went to the north side of the fenced yard and looked out of the fence for a while, I grabbed them and brought them in the house. I heard a noise north of the house prob. near the creek. I ask my wife if the noise was a coyote since she know them better than I do, she said, \"no, hell no I have never heard that before\" after we got inside I had her listen to a few audio clips, cougars,wolves, and then bigfoot clips on the site (1973,1978) she said that those clips sounded identical.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness via e-mail and then later by phone.  The witness described the vocalizations as being almost the same as the Puyallup Whoop Howls.  Based on the phone conversation, I was able to do a field investigation of the area where the witness described hearing the vocals come from.  He said that it was coming from the park north of town about a half mile from his home.  The park is at a place where three creek tributaries meet, and is very heavily wooded.  By viewing the area in person and via satellite photos, I surmised that the area would be ideal for a creature to use to travel from east to west through the more settled area without being detected.
