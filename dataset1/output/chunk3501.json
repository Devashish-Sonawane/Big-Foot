            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness had described the area around sighting before the interstate was constructed north of the Yakima River.  Area was used year round for various activities such as fishing, camping, swimming, and some hunting. \"As kids we were told never to play outside in the dark. Grandma would always tell us of the hairy man that would come out at night.  All kids that lived on the reservation were told stories of bigfoot, thought it was meant to keep us from playing outside when it got dark.\"\"This was all before the new highway was built... back before the road was paved...there was only one gravel road that used to go back there... back by our place.\"Not uncommon today to see deer and elk running through the area as populated as the area has become.  Today driving by site there is a speedway and gravel company that are within a few hundred yards of area where witness spotted the figure.Witness also relayed other stories of the closed areas of the reservation, mentioning Potato Hill, which is on the north side of Mt. Adams, west boundary of the Yakima Reservation and also mentioned in a few books about Sasquatch. \"My grandmother told me that she had seen one up in that area when she was young, picking huckleberries.\" ",
