            "Environment": "Sighting was on a rugged back country road with a few farms and homes, but mostly wooded.  I was stopped next to a fence taking pictures of horses.  I saw a big black thing about 225 feet jump in front of me just before the bend in the road.  We went back a different day about the same time and stopped in the road where I think it was.  We looked at the fence and it was bent.  The trees have a filtering light cover.  There is a hill on the left and a ravine in the right.  There is no guardrail, somewhat treacherous to drive on.  There is a little creek running through that I am sure ends up in the Mohican River.  We saw a rabbit.  Earlier in the week when I checked out the area after my sighting, I saw a deer there.  But it was light brown and somewhat juvenile.  I was happy to see the deer because it confirmed that what I saw, wasn't a deer.  There are some trees that are down and it is not terribly overgrown, (ie no rose thorn bushes taking over).  It is a peaceful, quiet, beautiful country scene which is why I like taking that road sometimes in the summer.",

I told my husband about it as soon as I got home.  They know me well and could tell that I was lit up about this event.  Then a few weeks later, my brother-in-law called to it.  Something answered that sounded like the audio clips we heard. It was in the direction of where I saw it.  He called it again, (he is good at it), and it, or something, answered again louder and longer.  It did not sound human.  So now I am not the only one that had an experience with this thing!",

Note that while I didn't want to play squatch sound on my computer sitting here by myself, I couldn't resist playing your clip of Ohio squatch just to see if it sounded the same.  It did and 20 minutes later, I heard the knock.  Coincidence?  I don't know but I am not too keen about calling the damn thing closer to me now.  I'll wait for others.  The knock I heard tonight could have been a deer marking a tree because that is common, but it sounded like someone taking a big stick and wacking it across a tree, not just rubbing against it.  I know what that sounds like.  Now, actually, I hear a deer snorting.  So maybe that's what it was.  For 14 years I have sat on this porch late at night and I can identify every sound. Tonight I did not play any music, and have decided to really listen to the sounds that are so familiar to me. That knock I just heard threw me for a loop!  Seriously, what the heck is going on here?",

            "Follow-Up Report": "A site investigation was conducted on 6/8/2013 with two other investigators, and the following can be added to this report.  There is a farm with many animals located less than a half mile from this location.  Open feed was noticed across this farm.  The area on the hill where this animal came from was on the left and is forested with pasture lands.  A thick copse of trees was noted several hundred yards up the hill.  The direction that the animal bounded across the road is wetlands with a small creek running through it.  It was also noted that sheep were heard from this area, and that a small farm is located there.  We were not able to ascertain if feed is left out on this farm.  The witness was admiring the horses on the hill and took these photos of them from her car:  The vehicle was running the whole time while in park.  After taking pictures of the horses, she decided to go home.  When looking forward to start to drive, she saw a large bipedal animal leap onto the road.  It landed on the road and went into the woods and creek area to the north.  While the animal was leaping, it had both of its arms extended out away from its body.  The witness does not know for sure why the arms were out, but speculates that it was for balance.  She did not see the animal start this motion, but only caught sight of it in mid jump.  Being startled she did not see it land, and was trying to figure out what she saw.  This is a photo of what would have been the view of the witness from her car:This visual of this animal was less than ten seconds.  While seeing this the witness' mind was reeling trying to figure out what she just saw. Thinking of this, she did not notice the animal exit the road and enter the swampy area.  The animal was dark in color, and seemed to be uniform in color.  It had two legs that were split in the jumping motion.  It also had a head located on the shoulders.  No neck was noticed.  Also noted during this site investigation was that there is a fence above this road.  It was approximately four feet in height.  There are several trees that are located along the fence line.  I stood the approximate distance from where the witness saw the animal and she stated it was much bigger than me.  She estimated that it was about eight feet tall.  This was approximately 250 feet away.  Being in mid air, she is not sure of the size and this is only speculative.  This area has seen several sightings in the past year, and other investigations are ongoing in this general vicinity.  ",
