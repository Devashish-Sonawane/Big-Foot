            "Observed": "I was deer hunting, watching a clearing between two thickets. It was between 7:30 and 8:00 in the morning in November, the temperature was below freezing and there was a thin layer of snow on the ground. The thickets were cedar thickets. I was sitting on an old road, in the head of the hollow, about a hundred yards from the trail crossing the clearing. The clearing was about 50 or 60 yards across. I heard, from the top of the thicket to my left, crashing, brush and limbs breaking, very loudly, like large limbs. It lasted maybe ten seconds or so. About five minutes later, I heard the same noise, maybe fifty or seventy five feet down the hill in the direction of the clearing. Brush and limbs thrashing, breaking, hitting together. Then about five minutes later, the same noise closer down the hill. The last time, it happened about 20 yards into the thicket from the clearing. Then, out of the thicket stepped something, walking on two legs, black from head to toe, with it's arms swinging by it's sides it walked across the clearing in probably no more than five or six seconds. I was too scared to move, but I took my gun and eased out of there, too busy watching the clearing to really look for tracks, but the grass was so thick I couldn't have seen any anyway. When I got to the truck, I waited on my hunting partner, worried that something might have happened to him, I walked partway back into the area and met him coming out, he asked if I had seen a large pile of feces in the road through the clearing on my way out. I had walked down that road about 30 minutes earlier and it wasn't there then. He said it was in the area where I saw this thing cross. He described the feces as loose, with grass and long, black hairs in it. I then told him what I saw and he said he was sure it was a bear and my imagination added to it. He never did believe me and no one else has, either. But it's true, I am a minister and have no reason to lie.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "In late August 2012, I conducted a follow-up investigation with the witness regarding his numerous encounters with a Sasquatch from early February to late August 2009. When I arrived, the witness proceeded to show me the deer bone fragments, possible hair samples, and numerous pictures of the deer carcass, destroyed fence, and tracks that he had discovered throughout his property.   The witness's residence is located north of Dayton, Ohio in a very heavily wooded area surrounded by farms, cornfields and small creeks. The Sasquatch encounters started on evening of 6 February 2009, around 11:30 PM. It was a calm night with a full moon, and there was approximately 2 \u0096 3 inches of snow on the ground.  The witness had just stepped out on his back deck to enjoy a cigarette before bedtime, when he heard what appeared to be a large animal walking through the woods, breaking branches as it moved, about 100 yards from is back deck near a fence line that separated his property from his neighbor's property. The large animal appeared to be getting closer to his back deck, finally stopping at the edge of the wood line, near the horse gate adjacent to his neighbor's property. In addition, his neighbor\u0092s horses had now become very restless, neighing and moving about frantically in the barn.  (The horse barn and adjoining corral are located near the fence line, not far from the movement.) Finally, the witness heard the suspected Sasquatch start to rattle the horse gate.Not sure of what it was that was approaching his house and rattling the horse gate, the witness went upstairs and notified his wife.  Both he and his wife opened one of the bedroom windows on the back of the house facing the woods and the fence line, to possibly see what was causing the commotion. Even though it was a calm, moonlit night neither the witness nor his wife could really see the suspected Sasquatch.  However, they heard the Sasquatch starting to move back into the woods away from the house and noticed some of the larger tree tops moving as though they were being brushed against or deliberately shaken. When they could no longer hear or see any movement activity, the witness and his wife went to bed.The next day, the witness and his wife were still talking about what it was that they had seen and heard the night before.  The witness\u0092 wife suggested that he go out and investigate what it was they had seen, because there was two to three inches of snow on the ground and whatever it was may have left some tracks.  The witness agreed and proceeded to walk along the wood line and immediately noticed several large, humanlike foots prints in the snow in the vicinity where they had heard and seen something moving the night before.  He immediately went back to the house and grabbed both his camera and carpenters square and proceeded to take several photographs of the dozen or so tracks that were clearly visible in the snow. Using the carpenter\u0092s square for reference, each of the tracks was approximately 17 inches long and 11 inches wide.The witness followed the tracks to fence line at the edge of his property, and noticed more large tracks criss-crossing the area. In addition, he noticed that the wire fence at the edge of his property, which was approximately five feet high, had been pushed down almost to the ground.  More amazingly, this was a relatively new fence that had a strand of barbwire on the top that had not only been snapped, but completely ripped from the fence pole. Basically, the barbwire was not cut \u0096 it was forcibly snapped!   It appeared that the Sasquatch pushed down the fence to step over it, so it could enter the witness\u0092 property the night before while probably pursuing deer.  (The witness also informed me that he had seen deer jump the fence numerous times in route to the surrounding cornfields.  He has also seen black bear tracks along the road on the other side of this fence, but black bears had never damaged the fence in an attempt to enter his property.)After photographing the damaged fence, the witness followed the large tracks for about 60 \u0096 70 yards, whereby he noticed a deer carcass on the ground.  Interestingly enough, the deer\u0092s upper jaw had been ripped off, three legs had been torn off, and the rib cage appeared to have been smashed.  He immediately noticed that the three missing legs had been stacked against a nearby tree \u0096 which was very unusual for a normal predator kill.  Also, the witness saw a distinct impression in the snow next to the deer carcass - where the Sasquatch had probably sat down. A few seconds later, the witness had his ball cap knocked off of his head by a large stick that was thrown at him.  He suddenly realized that the Sasquatch had probably been observing him the whole time and he proceeded to walk calmly, but briskly back toward his house.Around 11:30PM that evening, the witness stepped out onto his back deck to see if the Sasquatch had returned. He noticed a large dark figure, about 100 feet from his back deck along the wood line. The figure then started to walk a few feet toward the house, stopping behind a large tree.  It then repeatedly peaked around the large tree whereby the witness was able to see the dark outline of its head, as well as the reflection of its eyes.  After a few minutes, he got somewhat nervous and went into his house to retrieve his shotgun.  The witness stepped back out onto the deck with his shotgun and proceeded to chamber a round.  The figure then started walking back into the woods toward the location of the deer carcass. The next night, around 11:30PM the witness again went out onto his back deck and could hear the something walking around in the woods.  However, it did not approach the edge of the wood line, so he could not see it.No additional encounters occurred until early March 2009.  By this time the snow had melted and the witness decided to walk back to the edge of his property to see if there was any more Sasquatch evidence.  He walked throughout his property and did not notice any tracks.  As the witness approached a small stream that fills up each spring with winter melt, he noticed a primitive lean-to built from small sticks on the northwest edge of his property, on the opposite side of the creek.  He looked under the lean-to and notice five deer bones and some deer fur on the ground.  The witness retrieved the deer fur and five bones from under the lean-to and noticed strange scrapes or teeth marks on each of the bones. He kept them at his house and showed me during our follow-up investigation.Later that summer in early June 2009, the witness\u0092 daughter and son were playing on the swing set in the backyard in the early afternoon. His daughter suddenly noticed that someone or something was throwing small rocks at them from the woods.  The witness\u0092 daughter went to the front of the house where he was working in the garage and told him about the rock throwing. Concerned, he went to the backyard to see what was going on.  Just then, a larger rock about the size of a baseball was hurled at them from the wood line. The witness yelled \u0093look-out\u0094 and then grabbed his two children and went immediately into their house.Around 1:00 AM that evening, the witness decided to go on to his back deck to see if the Sasquatch had possibly returned.  He turned on his deck light and stepped out onto the deck saw the Sasquatch standing behind the swing set. From the few seconds that he observed it, the witness estimated that the Sasquatch was about 8 \u0096 9 feet tall.  (The swing set was approximately six feet high at the top of the crossbar, and the Sasquatch was about 2 \u00bd - 3 feet taller.)  After about four or five seconds, the Sasquatch darted into the woods.In early July 2009, the witness and his daughter were in their backyard near the wood line picking up sticks to burn in their fire pit. Just then \u0096 he and his daughter heard a loud vocalization that sounded like a \u0093lion\u0092s roar.\u0094 The witness and his daughter ran into the house and his daughter immediately told her mother what had happened and wondered if the noise had been made by one of the neighbor's horses.  The witness and his wife decided that the children should not go outside into the back yard for a while. A few days later, while he was outside the witness heard wood knocking coming from the woods.  A few weeks later, the witness and his wife had just retired for the evening when they heard something walking on the gravel driveway near the garbage cans, which are located near the front of the house. (During the investigation, I walked on the gravel driveway and confirmed the noise. The sound would have been amplified during the evening hours when its generally quieter and could easily have been heard in various sections of the house \u0096 especially during the summer when the windows are opened.)The witness went downstairs, turned on his front light and stepped outside.  He immediately noticed the Sasquatch standing next to his garbage cans. The Sasquatch saw the witness and started to walk away, towards the back yard.  After a few minutes, he decided to go walk out onto his back deck and could hear the Sasquatch walking in the woods.Finally, in mid-August 2009 there was another possible Sasquatch encounter.  Around 11:30 PM the witness could hear his neighbor\u0092s hunting dogs barking at someone or something. This was not unusual because the neighbor\u0092s dogs periodically got loose and would run around in the woods for a several minutes before eventually returning home. Not thinking much of it, the witness stepped outside and could hear something large walking in the woods between his property and his neighbor\u0092s property.  After several minutes, the noise stopped and the witness\u0092 neighbor pulled up on his ATV.  His neighbor had also heard something moving in the woods and the witness then proceeded to inform his neighbor of the various encounters that had occurred during the past year.The next day the witness and his neighbor proceeded to investigate the area of the woods where they had both heard the noises.  They were not able to find any meaningful evidence until his neighbor\u0092s dog found and retrieved a deer leg.  Both the witness and his neighbor continued the search on their properties whereby they discovered the remains of a deer carcass. The deer had been torn apart with both the head and hind legs having been removed. Since August 2009, the witness and his family have not had any similar encounters or found any additional evidence.A hair sample was provided to me. The sample consists of some deer hair - but there are three visible longer, black hairs that might be from a Sasquatch. The hair has been sent to a veterinarian who specializes in the identification of hair, and we will update this report accordingly. Based on the follow-up investigation, photographs, bones and hair samples that the witness provided, I sincerely believe that he is a very credible individual. The witness is a matter-of-fact person who has lived in the Dayton, Ohio area all of his life. He is currently employed as a government contractor working on advanced systems at Wright-Patterson AFB, near Dayton, Ohio. ",
