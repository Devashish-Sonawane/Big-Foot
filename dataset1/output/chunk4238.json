My brothers have since passed away. They are hairy, stand on their hind legs, have large eyes and are about as large as an average person or shorter, and are harmless as they ran away from the children.  They walk, they do not jump. They were seen on a farm near a branch of water. The boys waded and fished in the creek every day and once in awhile they would run to the house scared and tell the story. Later there was a piece in the Chicago paper stating there were such animals of that description and they were harmless.  This occurred about 60 years ago or a little less. My mother and father thought they were just chldren's stories until the Chicago paper told the story. Mrs. Beaulah Schroat Decatur  ",

            "Observed.1  ": "Judy Esterer of Paris is considering joining Dallas-based Texas Bigfoot Research Center. The New Mexico native said she grew up with tales of Sasquatch and Yeti \u0097 other names for Bigfoot-type creatures \u0097 from Indians. Esterer has lived in the Far East and has traveled extensively through the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe. \u0093It seems like everybody in the world knows of Bigfoot or knows a story about a Bigfoot-type character,\u0094 she said. \u0093It\u0092s one of those elusive critters that fascinates you.\u0094 Reports of sightings in Texas date back to the 1960s and earlier, and the Internet is replete with recent reports. In January, a Lamar Point resident reported chickens missing. The resident said his other animals were spooked and his dogs wouldn\u0092t follow the trail, which led through thick woods to a recently mowed clearing strewn with chicken feathers but no skin or bones. The trail led on to a creek where the resident said large footprints were visible in the sand. In Clarksville in May 1999, two women said they saw something crossing U.S. 82 about three miles from the Clarksville Country Club. The creature was hunched over and crossed the highway in about four steps, they said. \u0093I don\u0092t know how widespread these things are,\u0094 Craig Woolheater, assistant director and co-founder of the Texas Bigfoot Research Center, said. \u0093I couldn\u0092t give you a population.\u0094 Researchers have developed some very definite ideas about the appearance and behavior of Bigfoot \u0097 an apelike creature about 8 feet tall with reddish-brown hair that lives primarily in wooded areas with a large source of water, such as a lake. Signs of Bigfoot activity include broken trees and limbs and twisted limbs, which researchers consider territorial markers. Ken Marvel has conducted several investigations in Lamar County for the research center, which have yielded a plaster cast of a footprint, photographs of tree breaks and possible nesting areas, and a hair sample one witness provided. He spent the night on one site in the county in February, but nothing was attracted to the bait he set out. Bigfoot seems to enjoy a wide variety of food, including fruit and vegetables, and, of course, pet food. \u0093It loves cat food,\u0094 Marvel said. \u0093Canned cat food especially. Canned dog food as well.\u0094 The Texas Bigfoot Research Center\u0092s mission is to find and study the animals in their natural habitat, using motion sensing cameras to capture them on film. Other plans include taking DNA samples and implanting a transmitter to track the animals. Photographs by themselves will never be enough, Holley said, because they are too easily doctored. He advocates a different approach \u0097 he\u0092s out to bag a Bigfoot. \u0093Only a body\u0092s going to suffice,\u0094 he said. \u0093Or even a part of the body, if you can find an intact skull.\u0094 Holley\u0092s interest started in 1971. He and a friend were on an island in Broken Bow Lake when they noticed they were being followed. Thinking it might be a bear, the pair started running. They heard heavy breathing behind them, Holley said. He described the pursuing creature as gorilla-like \u0097 reddish-brown in color and about 7 feet tall. The two ran to their boat. The creature followed them into the water partway before turning back. Holley said. \u0093(When) something scares you, you want to know what it is, and I\u0092ve stayed with it for all these years,\u0094 he said. \u0093What started out as an 18-year-old trying to figure out what he saw has turned into a 30-year quest.\u0094 Woolheater said he and his wife saw a Sasquatch in Louisiana in May 1994, about 175 miles northeast of New Orleans, walking along a highway. The creature was about 7 feet tall and hairy, he said. Esterer said she has seen footprints in the Sulphur River bottom and heard them calling in Reno. Skepticism is normal for the field \u0097 some even consider it necessary \u0097 and investigators will admit that not everything out in the woods is Bigfoot, such as the dung and hair samples that Holley freely admits could have come from a bear, although he says few bears in Oklahoma are tall enough to leave hair 7 feet up in a tree. \u0093I\u0092m not going to stick 30 years of hunting these things out in the open and say, \u0091It\u0092s got to be,\u0092\u0094 he said. \u0093I\u0092d say 90 percent of the time it\u0092s not. These things are shy and they\u0092re not going to reveal themselves unless they\u0092re curious about something.\u0094 Whether it\u0092s really Bigfoot, a bear or people with overactive imaginations, the hunt with camera and gun is likely to continue. Tales of roaming Sasquatch have carved out a niche in people\u0092s imaginations so deeply that some believe without ever seeing so much as a footprint. \u0093I think people that believe sight unseen want to believe that there\u0092s a mystery out there to be solved,\u0094 said Holley. \u0093I think those out there who do see become, like I did, obsessed with finding the truth.\u0094 (Jeff Parish receives e-mail at jeff.parish@theparisnews.com)  \u00a9 2000 The Paris News.
