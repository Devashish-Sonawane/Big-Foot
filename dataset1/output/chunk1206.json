            "Follow-Up Report": "   The witness described himself as an avid hunter who is familiar with the local wildlife, but is adamant that what he saw that afternoon was not a normal animal found in the woods of southern Georgia.  He spoke with sincerity and obvious emotion as he described what he saw, and said that he had \"never been so scared in his life\".   When I asked him about the possibility that he had been hoaxed by someone, he said that it would be impossible; no one else knew that he and his uncle were going hunting that afternoon, and they did not decide specifically where to go for their hunt until the last minute.   He described the being he saw as approximately seven feet tall,  blackish in color, heavily built - \"like a football player\", and covered with hair that appeared to be twelve to thirteen inches in length.  He estimated its weight to be over three hundred pounds.  Its arms were at its sides as it stood by the tree.  Its eyes appeared black, and darted left to right, having what he described as \"a wild look - like an animal\".  He saw a dark or grayish-colored cheek area on it's face, and a pointed nose. He did not notice ears, but said that perhaps hair was draped over them.   As he approached the area where he heard the water splashing, he heard a deep growl that lasted fifteen to twenty seconds.  According to the witness, the growl was not a bear, cat, owl, coyote, or any other animal that you might normally encounter in the woods.   Upon questioning some of his acquaintances following his sighting, the witness learned that many local hunters claimed to have seen a similar animal in the area.",
