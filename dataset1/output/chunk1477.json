He basically told me that he was not good at distances, but if he had to guess, it was no closer than a \"football field.\" The witness remembered seeing the \"legs splayed\" apart and remembered seeing how the arms were displayed in an outward manner. The sighting happened quickly, but the witness was confident that he saw no deer or any other quadrupedal animal. The creature that he saw, as he recalled, was not leaning forward in the least, and appeared to him to be completely erect in posture. Because of distance, it was difficult for the witness to ascertain height, but the animal was \"at least as tall as a man.\" Others in his party attempted to convince him otherwise, but the witness remains to this day steadfast in his conviction that he saw a sasquatch.
