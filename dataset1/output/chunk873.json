So there are two pairs of witnesses.The witness's son and friend reported a similar experience near the same location within 30-60 minutes, however the vocalizations they experienced were much more aggressive sounding than what the father reported.  The son and his friend reported vocalizations from two different animals.When the witness reported the incident to a game warden, the warden mentioned other similar incidents to the east in part of the national forest near the Neches/Trinity area.",
