            "Observed.1  ": "the countryside at night in search of food.   Some of the stories were generated by Bigfoot sightings reported in July and September near the small town of Ottosen, where several Humboldt County residents said they either saw Bigfoot or heard strange screams in the night.   Many dismiss Bigfoot as a myth.  Others, who believe there is a Bigfoot, Yeti or Sasquatch that occupies a place between man and ape, argue the creature lives only in the Northwest and could not possibly survive in the Midwest.   Nevertheless, the Bigfoot phenomenon - whether fact, fiction or hoax - is very much alive in Iowa.   Since last January, Bigfoot has been reported near at least 10 Iowa communities.   Deeds attributed to Bigfoot range from a pile of dead chickens found near the Mitchell County town of Riceville to the dark face that peered at a woman through the kitchen window of a farm near Ottosen.   There is even one unsubstantiated report from a Sioux City research group that a man wounded a Bigfoot with a deer rifle in 1974 near Stone State Park on the northwest edge of Sioux City.   In every case, authorities have been unable to establish conclusively that Bigfoot exists.  Yet, they have not completely accepted other explanations for the events.   Some law officers, like Humboldt County Sheriff Marvin Andersen, are just relieved when the Bigfoot phenomenon moves out of their area.   Andersen, who spent a good part of three months chasing down Bigfoot reports near Ottosen, said last week, \"We haven't had anything now for about three weeks.\"   Andersen said he never was able to draw any conclusions from the reports.   \"I still feel like these people definitely saw something but I don't know what,\" he said.   That was also the opinion of Iowa Conservation Officer Bill Basler of Algona, who talked to some of the people involved with the Ottosen sightings.   \"I believe, too that these people are seeing something, but I don't know yet just what it is,\" Basler said.   Most of the Bigfoot incidents reported in Iowa during the past year have been investigated by members of the Bigfoot Information Center, a group of Bigfoot enthusiasts who joined together last summer under the direction of Kevin Cook, 25, of Des Moines.   The center currently has four members, including Cook, who are collecting data on each new sighting.   Cook and his crew believe there are small groups of Bigfoots (or Bigfeet) traveling by night through the Midwest, generally following the Missouri and Mississippi River basins.   Since last winter, they have checked out Bigfoot reports near Pella, Harvey, Oskaloosa, Charlton, Moulton, Clarion, West Bend, Humboldt, Hardy and, of course, Ottosen.   Cook expects more sightings this winter.   \"Because of the snowfall people are more apt to see tracks, and there's not the vegetation in the winter as in spring and fall so the tracks are a lot more visible,\" Cook said.   He also is betting that some reports will come from hunters and snowmobilers, especially in the heavily wooded regions of southern Iowa, where the Bigfoot phenomenon has flared up in the past.   Several Bigfoot reports were turned in last winter in south- central Iowa, and a sighting was reported in the fall of 1975 near the Jefferson County town of Lockridge in southeast Iowa. At that time, at least three persons said they saw a large, ape-like creature in the Turkey Creek area.   The following is a summary of Bigfoot incidents that have been reported in Iowa since last January:   OSKALOOSA - Matt Ver Steeg of Knoxville, a member of the Iowa Bigfoot Information Center, checked a report around Jan. 1 that a woman who lives northeast of Oskaloosa near the Skunk River had seen a Bigfoot come out from the shadow of a tree during a heavy snowstorm.  She described the creature as weighing 600 to 700 pounds and standing 8 to 10 feet tall.  A few days later, another resident in that area heard unusual noises and found strange tracks in his yard.   HARVEY - Around Feb. 20 some residents of Harvey, a Marion County town near the Des Moines River, reported strange noises and track in the snow on the edge of town.  Ver Steeg visited the area after a 14-inch snowstorm and found track that were 20 inches long, 9 inches wide and had a five-foot stride.  He followed the tracks on his snowmobile for several miles.  \"It looked like could have been two animals the way the tracks were because of the way they crisscrossed,\" Ver Steeg said.  Deputy Sheriff Dick Gilman said that after analyzing some hair on a fence the sheriff's office concluded the creature was a cow. But Ver Steeg contends a cow could not have made those tracks and set such a pace.   PELLA - Around Feb. 25 Ver Steeg was summoned to the old Pella Bridge, which crosses the Des Moines River a few miles north of Harvey, to investigate a report that a 10 or 11-year-old boy had seen Bigfoot on the road near the bridge.  The boy said the creature had stopped to look at him, then disappeared into the woods.  Ver Steeg followed the tracks into the woods, but they had filled with snow and it was impossible to make any kind of determination.  Ver Steeg said the boy was so frightened he could not leave the house for several days.   CHARITON - Throughout the year, Ver Steeg and Cook have received numerous reports of sightings and strange sounds in a section of Stephens State Forest that is a few miles northeast of Chariton, the Lucas County seat.  The sightings never have been verified.   MOULTON - Two Moulton-Udell High School students reported seeing a creature about 10:30 p.m. Aug. 28 on a dirt road in a remote area south of Moulton known as Dean Bottoms.  They said it was 7 to 8 feet tall and weighed about 400 pounds.  The next day their science teacher accompanied them to the area, where he found a footprint about 14 inches long with three toe impressions, some corn that had been stripped \"clean down the cob,\" and an area where some brush had been trampled.  Gary Hagler of Des Moines, a member of the Bigfoot center, visited the area and confirmed those findings.   OTTOSEN - In all, nearly a dozen persons reported seeing a Bigfoot-like creature in the Ottosen area from July through the middle of September.  This case received the most publicity of any sighting.  There were reports that Bigfoot was seen in town on at least three occasions and in the countryside twice. Farmers in the area also said they were awakened at night by strange sounds made by something that left farm dogs terrified. And there were reports of mutilated animals, strange footprints and stampeding cattle.   WEST BEND - During the period of the Ottosen sightings, a fisherman found about two dozen footprints under a bridge over the west branch of the Des Moines River near West Bend.  Plaster casts were made of the tracks, which were 16 inches long and 5 inches wide.   HUMBOLDT - In mid-September, a family that lives about three miles northeast of Humboldt reported that something released strange howls while moving through a ravine near their home at midnight.  The creature followed the woods to within a few yards of the home.  The sound - a hoarse howl - was so loud that Sheriff Andersen could hear it through the telephone when they called him.  Andersen visited the area the next morning and found places where the brush had been trampled but no tracks.   HARDY - A few days later, a 16-year-old boy told authorities he saw a Bigfoot-like creature near dusk in a beanfield on a farm near the Humboldt County town of Hardy.  He said he scared the creature off by honking the horn and flashing the lights of a pickup.  The next day, Sheriff Andersen visited the field and found footprints that ended in a wooded area.  Ken Taylor of Iowa Falls, another member of the Bigfoot center, looked into that report but was not convinced it was a legitimate sighting.   CLARION - In early October, a Clarion woman told police that a dark image had peered through her kitchen window about 10:30 one night.  The window, at the rear of the house, is seven feet off of the ground.  The next afternoon, police officers obtained a plaster cast of one of several large indentations in the backyard.  Clarion is the seat of Wright County, which is adjacent to Humboldt County, where the Ottosen sightings occurred.  The Bigfoot center's Hagler and Taylor looked into the sighting and determined that someone could have been performing a hoax.  They reported that the impressions they found were of right feet only.",
