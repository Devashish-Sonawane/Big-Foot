            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for approximately one hour.The experience occurred when he and his neighbor went deer hunting off a particular road in the county. The area they were in has been closed for several months due to excessive garbage dumping. They arrived in the area about an hour before sunrise. While waiting for the sun to rise, they sat in the neighbor\u0092s pickup truck with the windows rolled down. They talked and smoked cigarettes. The wood knocking he heard was approximately seventy feet from the truck. The first set of knocks was seven big knocks, followed by a reply of seven knocks in the distance estimated to be several hundred yards away. He emphasized that the seven knocks were very loud. I specifically inquired as to whether the return knocks they heard could have been echoes from the knocks near their truck. He stated that too much time had elapsed between the knocks to be echoes, although the return knocks did come fairly quickly, at approximately five to six seconds after the knocks near the truck sounded. He estimates the knocking lasted for eight to ten minutes before the low bed truck arrived in the area. The witness said the knocks sounded just like the wood knocks on the BFRO web page (whoops and knocks compilation clip). He drives a log truck for a living and he estimates he\u0092s in the woods most days on average of sixteen to eighteen hours. His hunting partner heard the knocks, but blew them off as a deer hunter who was \u0093trying to spook a deer\u0094. This incident took place in an area that's had a history of bigfoot activity over the years.",
