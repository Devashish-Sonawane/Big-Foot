Sounded like a scream! It was the most scariest sound I have ever heard. It was weird because the call I got back sounded a lot like Matt Moneymaker's recording he got back in the 90's in Ohio. We went back June 6th around the same time and we heard the same whoop back! It was scary even though we heard it before.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness, I can add the following to the report.  The witness and his father were at the entrance of Kendall Lake in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.  The gate was closed and locked.  The two were doing various calls (whoops and howls) from the gated area.  The witness was recording the calls and received the following response. This is a shortened and cleaned-up version of the recording submitted to us:(Audio Clip)The witness stated the response emanated from the area southeast of the gate.I was also sent a photo regarding the print mentioned. The trail where they found the print is the Cross Country trail. Its a nice, wide trail that people run all the time.  It looked like the print could be from a runner that tried to stop, and slid in the mud. Also, he didn't take any 'before' pics, just pics of the cast in the ground so its hard to give our opinion.The Cuyahoga Valley National Park has a long history of both Class A and Class B reports.  Several of the reports have occurred within a few miles of the Kendall Lake area:Report #41471Report #31852Report #25715Report #22569Report #15885BFRO Article regarding Sasquatch Howls Recorded in Cuyahoga Valley National ParkThe Cuyahoga Valley National Park encompasses nearly 33,000 acres of forested land, meadows, rivers and streams.  Food sources are abundant including fish, deer and various local farms.",
