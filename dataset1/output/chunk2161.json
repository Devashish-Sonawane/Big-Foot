I was near a small body of water when I heard odd sounds about three hundred yards away.  The sounds were from a large creature.  They were \"sing song\" in pattern and unlike anything I have ever heard.  The creature appeared to by \"talking\" to itself as there was only one creature.  It did not sound angry and lasted for about two minutes.  The sound change in pitch and fluctuation.  I was not scared but did leave quickly.  I have since studied sounds of coyotes and found no similarties at all.  There were no yelps, barks or growls.  I can not duplicate the sounds.  It is like nothing I have ever heard in the woods or else where.  My wife and I went back two weeks later and found no signs of anything out of the norm.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on 10/25/2006.The witness experienced two vocalization events represented on the BFRO web site as two separate reports:Below is a summary of the two events in chronological order:1. Report #15565The second incident occurred on May 11, 2002 at 2:30 a.m. Three to four screams were heard about five seconds apart. It sounded somewhat like a human female, but, more powerful and blood curdling. At first, the witness thought it was a some type of bird, but, quickly dismissed that idea because of the sheer volume of sound, as if coming from a big animal. The witness believes the screams were coming from three different animals; one was very close to his camp, the others were as much as two miles away. The witness speculated they were either calling to each other or was territorial in nature.2. Report #15566The first incident occurred on March 31, 2006 around noon. The witness hiked into a pond southwest of Sabbath Day Point. Approximately 300 yards further southwest of his position, he heard a very loud and powerful, \"sing-song\" type of vocalization. This vocalization went on for a continuous two minutes. The witness described it almost speech-like, as if the creature was carrying on a conversation. But, the witness could not hear any reply in return.",

I shouted to my husband \"DID YOU SEE THAT?\" He said, \"See what?\" I was all excited and couldn't believe that he didn't see it, but he had a good reason, he was focused on the steep hill and curve we were about to drive up and it was late and dark out.  We drove down Cherry Street in Germantown that turns into Diamond Mill on the outskirts of town. There is a fork in the road at Little Twin Road.  We go this route frequently when we go to my mother's in Middletown from our home off of Diamond Mill located on the outskirts of Farmersville and we come home the same direction.  We were on the way home when I saw this creature.  I was in total shock that night when I saw something really tall with long straight hair all over, dark rusty brown, and had a long stride as it crossed the road.  I was trying to see if it were a hunter dressed in some hunting outfit, but then remembered that it was March and NOT hunting season.  I told others of this sighting and was made fun of repeatedly until my neighbor just told me this morning of seeing the bigfoot in the same area.  I was elated that finally someone else saw what I saw in the same location!  I now travel with my camera ready in that area!",
