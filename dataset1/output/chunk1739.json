            "Follow-Up Report": "There were a few additional details of the physical description of what the witness observed gathered during a telephone interview.  The witness stated that the first part of the creature illuminated by his flashlight was the torso.  He stated it had a broad mid-section, no abdominal muscles were visible but it looked \u0093solidly built\u0094 to him.  The hair was reddish brown,  around three to four inches long, not matted, but shiny and well kept.  He did not recall any smells during the incident.  As he swung the flashlight up he focused upon red, glowing eyes the size of fifty cent pieces.  He did not remember any other facial features, he stated he was focused on the eyes at that point.The animal let out what he described as a combination of a snort and grunt, and then quickly took two steps to climb a very steep six foot bank and disappeared into the trees above them.  He stated that it was if it looped back around and came back toward them at an angle as they retreated back to the campfire.    I did ask him about the time it would take to break camp, the witness stated that they were only carrying sleeping bags, .22 rifles and food.  As they left the area the individual they had come upon trailed them, making noise, coming close and then falling back.  He said at times it came back as close as 15 feet.  They did not attempt to shine the flashlights on it again because they were using the lights on the road as they fast walked and ran back to the car.  The other creature, which was also making vocalizations and other noises, seemed to be closing in at them from an angle.  He said throughout the evening it was as if the creatures would mimic each others vocalizations.We discussed the fact that the tires had been thrown into the road, and the witness added  that they did find some vandalism of the car when they returned.  My opinion is that it is speculation if those acts were done by the animals, I am more inclined to place the blame upon people who may have happened upon the parked car.  The young men did have .22 rifles with them for target shooting, and so the chance that the whole incident was a hoax is unlikely as it would be quite a risk to a hoaxer.I did ask the witness about having a gun and not taking a shot.  His reply was it never entered his mind because the initial incident happened quickly and that, given the size of what he saw, taking a shot from a distance would probably have done nothing.  He added he was glad they did not shoot because then he felt they might have been attacked.At the time, the witness was working in a position where he felt talking about this incident would put his job in jeopardy.  He never discussed it with co-workers, other friends or family.  It was a genuinely scary experience for the witness and his friends, in his terms, \u0093I almost wet myself\u0094.  To this day, he has not told his wife or family, and would not consider talking to his new co-workers about it.  I was the first person he said he had actually talked at length about what happened that night.  There were times during the interview that I could hear the distress he was experiencing in retelling the story.  The event changed some of his outdoor lifestyle, he stayed out of the woods for awhile and now only hunts with others.  He concluded by saying it was a relief to finally be able to talk about this experience with someone he could trust to not immediately call him a \u0093kook\u0094 and make fun of him.Southern Ohio can benefit from rare warm days in February, although the weather is volatile.  Temperature highs in the upper 50\u0092s and low 60\u0092s do happen for short periods during the month.  It is plausible that a group could comfortably camp overnight during one of these rare warm periods, and the report cannot be dismissed on that basis alone.Wayne National Forest is a huge area that encompasses a large part of south east Ohio.  The forest boundaries encompass around 834,000 acres, of which over 236,000 acres are owned by the federal government.  It includes areas of second growth timber, mostly oak and hickory, and reclaimed mining areas.  The Shawnee State Forest borders the western area of Wayne N.F., it encompasses an additional 60,000 acres.I found the witness to be credible and the possibility for a misidentification to be low.",
