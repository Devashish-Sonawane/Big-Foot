He was on his way home from his father's house in Idaho with his young son when the incident occurred.Excerpts of interview with witness.\"I was on Highway 26 going into Idaho on a stretch of road where the deer apparently migrate through and I had my little boy in the truck. It was night and it was snowing a little bit. I'd just come over a hill and I saw something standing right off the side of the road.  Whatever it was, it didn't have short legs and as soon as my lights hit it, it ran off down the hill on two legs.\"Witness estimated the distance at 80 yards. He added he only saw the animal in silhouette.\"What was strange was bears are kind of stocky and round. This thing had a really big upper body. And it didn't have short legs. As soon as I came over the hill, it just kind of trotted off.'It took a stride and the legs were long. They weren't short like a bear.''Witness said he stopped the truck where the animal left the road. \"I saw smeared tracks in the mud and snow going off down the side of the hill. But I had my kid with me and I didn't want to go down there anyway.\" He also noted that there were several deer along the road just past the spot where he saw the animal. \"It seemed when I came over the hill that it was looking at them.''\"I\u2019ll tell you what, I haven\u2019t seen anything like that before.I\u2019m almost positive it was a bigfoot.\"",
