            "Observed": "Myself and two friends went into the forest with our slingshots to find some squirrels. We had been coming to this place for years every September for our church retreat. The elk were just starting to come into rut and we could hear them bugling up on the higher plateaus as we were hiking in. We were about a mile or so in, N.W. of the lodge. There was a barbed wired fence cutting through the woods here and on either side of it for about 10-15 yards the trees were younger, ranging from 4-8 feet tall. It was apparently cleared for the making of the fence.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness called me, at his expense, and we were on the phone for well over an hour. The one phrase that he kept repeating is that he has no idea what it was he saw, but that it appeared to be identical to what people describe as being a sasquatch, and that it was definitely an animal of some kind. The witness claims that he did not have a preconception of what a sasquatch should look like, as he had never heard any mention of them up until his encounter. As I questioned him further, he did reveal some interesting details about the sighting. The incident took place at between 15 and 20 yards distance, and lasted 2 minutes or so. He noticed that the arms were exceptionally long, though they did not quite reach the knees. He also noted that the upper body seemed very disproportionate to the lower body, in that the upper body was very long, while the legs were rather short in comparison. The legs were very thick and muscular, though. He also mentioned the rump of the animal as being very large. Not protruding, but very pronounced and muscular. He went on to mention that the animal was very broad across the shoulders, and that it was slouched forward slightly. He described it as being like a man that was just starting to slouch forward, as if to place his hands on his knees. The shoulders appeared to be more forward on the torso than they would on a person, as it stood there. He said that the face appeared negroid, except that it was wider in through the jowls. He also noted that the animal had an extremely pronounced sagittal crest, so much so that he was unable to make out the eyes of the animal. The nose was pushed up, wide and flat. During the entire duration of their standoff, the animal did not move. During this time, he said that his friend shouted at the animal a couple of times, but without effect. While they were standing there, he said that he could hear the animal breathing from time to time, as if it were taking in an occasional deep breath. After the last time his friend yelled at the animal, it let out a sort of soft cough/grunt, and moved slightly to the left and forward, towards them. He describes the sound as being kind of like a bear cough, but not quite. His attempts to mimic it over the phone fell short. Upon witnessing this grunt and movement by the creature, the boys immediately turned around and fled the area. As he states above, they returned the next day with his father, an experienced outdoorsman, but found nothing other than disturbances where the animal had been standing. In closing, he says that at no time during the encounter did he feel threatened by the animal, although he was in awe of the sheer size and perceived strength of it. It seemed equally as curious in them as they were in it. He went on to mention that he did not notice any foul odors associated with the animal, and he did not see any features to denote which sex the animal was. ",
