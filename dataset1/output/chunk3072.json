They were able to see red eyes reflected in the lighting and porch light. The animal was large but unknown how big due to very steep hill sloping away from house. The area is dense brush and briars. Eyes were about 3 to 4 inches apart. No tracks or hair were found by myself or my friends. There have been reports of other sightings in the area, but I'm not sure how far from his house they were.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness on the phone, he currently lives in the same area. He told me that he has hunted and trapped the area all his life, and is familiar with all of the wildlife in the state including some seldom seen animals. He told me that the experience he had was when he was much younger. It happened in the early 70's, he is not really sure what year it was but that it was in the fall during deer hunting season. At that time the area was virgin forest but since has been logged off in areas. He stated that when he was hunting from a stand, he had heard a chirp/grunt that he had not ever heard before. Thinking that it was a buck he looked in the direction and noticed a large brown object coming through the brush from about a hundred and fifty yards. At first he thought it was a moose, and continued to watch it as it got closer. When it came to within 50 - 60 yards from him it entered a shooting lane that he had cleared. That is when he states that he seen it clearly, and it was about eight feet tall (figured out later). At first he thought it was a person in a fur coat. So he yelled at him and it turned and looked at him, then turned away and headed towards a grove of cedars. He stated that the sighting lasted around sixty seconds or so. He described it as being hair covered but not an extreme amount of hair. Brown in color, with a sunken in facial area, with long arms that swung as it walked away slightly hunched over. He now estimates that it must have weighed around 500 - 600 pounds based on what he now knows. He had returned to the area after fleeing with his father and that is when they estimated the height as being around eight foot by the branches on the nearby trees. His father's friend apparently heard about his sighting and came to see them and told them that he had seen the same thing cross the road near there about six hours earlier. The witness' father did not want to talk about it much as he was embarrassed about it. The witness' old boss this fall had apparently had a sighting very close to the same area.  ",
