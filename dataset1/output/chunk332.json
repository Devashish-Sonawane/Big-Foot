He provided the following additional information: The only vocalization that he heard sounded like a huffing sound; similar to the sound a cow makes. The main cause for concern for the witness was the crashing sounds that sounded like a large animal forcing its way through heavy brush. This area is very thick, wild, and not fenced for domestic livestock. After about 10-15 minutes of these sounds, everything became very still, and the smell of bad body odor became stronger. The silence was disturbed by a loud crack; like a tree limb being broken. The witness immediately shined his four-cell flashlight in the direction of the sound. At the edge of the beam (about 30 yards away) he saw the shadowy silhouette of something very large and human-shaped. It was gone before he could get a better look at it. He was unable to provide any specific detail about its appearance. The witness and his son hastily departed, leaving a cooler and chair behind. Later that evening, he and an adult relative returned to retrieve these items. He never went back to this area since this event.The witness stated that he has been fascinated by the bigfoot phenomena since his experience, and frequently seeks information on the internet and television shows about the subject. I found him to be very forthright, sincere, and consistent in his recollection.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the witness by telephone and the following details can be added to the report:--The area is located in the Tahoe National Forest, forested with pine trees and oaks.  They were in a wide open flat, which goes down to a creek;--the club uses the area one time each month for two days.  The area has only dirt roads, and sometimes, people from Foresthill come by, but mostly people who are not participating in the events are not around;--on Saturday, their events occurred from dawn to dusk, and included a 81 mm German Mortar that shot PVC pipe; small explosives; automatic weapons (blanks); German WWII half track; Kubbel wagon; and full-blown uniforms;--\"war\" activities stopped around 6:30 to 7:00 p.m.  Most everyone, including witness, went to bed at 9:00, and the howls started about 10:30 to 11:00 p.m.;--there were four events, with approximately nine screams in each event.  The first sounded like it came from the ridge, the second down the road (less than 100 yards); The third downhill and the fourth further away.  There was one hour between first event and second event, with the third and fourth coming quickly thereafter;--description of howl: bellowish, very loud and deep pitched, with the deepest part turning \"raspy\", like a horse human. The howls also echoed, and before the echo died out, the next call came;--sounds were similar to those on the A&E special on bigfoot, but the tone wasn't as clear and sharp as in person;--the next day they tried to find footprints, but found nothing;--witness has been back since, but nothing else has occurred; and--witness has hunted, and knows bear and cat sounds, but this howl was like nothing he or the 15+ people who also heard it  could explain.Additional observation:  According to an expert on military equipment, it was estimated that the sounds of the \"war\" activities would carry somewhere between 2 to 4 miles in a forest setting.  It can be assumed that the creature that made the howls was not within this \"sound\" zone during the activities, because it would likely have avoided the area.  Based on the fact that activities ended at 7:00 p.m. and the howls started at 10:30 p.m., the creatures apparently traveled an estimated four miles to the camp in about 3.5 hours.",
