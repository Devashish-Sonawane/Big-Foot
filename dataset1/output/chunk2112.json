            "Follow-Up Report": "When I talked with the witness he said there were several things that struck him at the time (before the telepathic incident).  First was how human-like the creature was despite the hair and large size, and its utter calmness as it looked at him and continued to nibble on leaves.  Most striking about its features were its penetrating eyes which conveyed an attitude of extreme confidence.  He was also puzzled by the fact that despite its nearness and the length of time he observed it, he was totally unable to determine its sex.  I asked whether both he and his friend received the telepathic message and he replied that it was only him.",

            "Observed": "Me and my girlfreind went camping up in the MT. Loop area in snohomish county and when we got to our campsite, we saw a couple large footprints along the side of the dirt road next to were we parked, i immediately disregarged it being a bigfoot and figured that it was someone with enormous feet running around barefoot prior to us getting there. as it started to get darker we both had heard what sounded like someone yelling in a deep voice then turned into what sounded like a low tone groan and then stopped, this happened at about 9:30 pm. my girlfreind started to get scared so i told her it was probably just a bear making its sound and i lit a fire and we sat around the fire and talked for a few hours. once we we wanted to go to bed, we climbed into the back of the jeep and as i was closing the back door we heard the same sound again but allot closer to our area. after the noise stopped and about an hour went by we had heard loud rusttling sounds in the bushes on the upper part of the hill on the other side of the road and very loud footfalls and we also heard something very large splashing in the river which was i would say 30 feet from our jeep. we both shined flashlights out the windows but couldnt see anything, as we were doing that a vehicle came down the road and slammed their brakes on just passed our camp site. we heard them get out of their vehicle and started talking so i got out and went to them and asked if everything was okay, and their response to my question was that some massive hairy thing ran across the road right infront of them which they almost hit. they said oh it could of been bigfoot jokingly until i told them the sounds that we were hearing all night and they said that we should probably go then cause that sounds really creepy and that theyve heard of reports in the area of a \"bigfoor\" in the past. now thats kind of the breif rundown of what happened that night, but i am still a skeptic about it but anything is possible, i am millitary i serve in the US army and have seen allot of crazy things so it wouldnt surprise me that its real, but im still a skeptic. The last incident that ive had with a \"bigfoot\" which im not the only one who saw this, but we were out doing a bradley gunner at a range on base, and a bradley IFV has very detailed thermal scopes on it for night shooting, and we all saw what appeared to be  a very large person running at the very far edge of the range which is almost 2 miles away, i saw it, and 3 other people in three other vehicles saw the same thing, so we asked range control if anyone was down there were we were shooting and they said there shouldnt be and sent someone down to check it out but there was nothing to be found.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with this person at length over the phone not long after he filed this report. His physical description of the location and campsite was very detailed, and I was able to find the precise spot without trouble.  The location is on the Mt. Loop Highway, along a stretch where the Stillaguamish River flows westerly. The camping spot is one of many wide pull-outs on the shoulder beside the river along this road. His vehicle was parked facing east along the north side of the river. Across the road to the north there is an embankment roughly 20 feet tall and with approximately 45 degrees of slope.  During late summer the river diminishes in flow rate and shallows to where it is easily waded across at this location.The witness stated they arrived at approximately 3:00pm and set-up their campsite with firewood and a fire pit.  At roughly 5:00pm they began hearing vocalizations that were described as high-pitched yelling descending into a low-pitched growl. These sounds emanated from the hill to the north of their campsite. The vocalizations continued sporadically, and were moving closer to the campsite. As they prepared dinner, they could hear the sound of \"something moving on the hill\" on the north side. The final \"call\" was heard at approximately 9:30PM as the campers moved into their SUV for the night. This call was much closer to them. Some time later, they began to hear stomping sounds around their camp and a splash in the river. They were unable to see the source of the noises while looking out the windows of their vehicle by flashlight.By this time, it was nearly 2:30AM and they could hear a car coming up the road behind them, from the west. The witness says that the car suddenly braked and skidded to a stop just beyond their campsite. The excited voices of the occupants caused the witness to go see what was happening. The witness states that the two male occupants of the car claimed to have just seen a \"big, hairy thing cross the road in front of their camp [from south to north] and run up the bank.\"At first light, the campers gathered their gear and left.The second incident reported by this gentlemen predates this first report by an unknown amount of time. He is unable to pinpoint an approximate year or month when it occurred.  However, the location was the JBLM firing range just east of Ft. Lewis. At the time he was assigned to a Bradley M2 IFV, or Infantry Fighting Vehicle. These vehicles are manned by a crew of three; Commander, Driver, and Gunner. They are equipped with two main weapons; a 25mm cannon and a 7.62 machine gun. There were three Bradleys on the range that night firing the 25mm cannon (chain gun) at a range of approximately 2,000 yards. This gentleman was observing the round impacts through a thermal imaging scope when he observed a large, upright bipedal figure run across the range right to left. All three vehicles purportedly observed the same thing and simultaneously called \"cease fire.\" The Range Officer went down-range to investigate.  The witness states that the Range Officer was unable to locate any source for the thermal image.  It is reported that the three Bradleys were firing AP or armor piercing rounds and not high-explosive rounds that night.  Although there is a definite thump from the round impact on the target, the lack of explosion on the target could have confused someone or some thing as to the source and direction of the firing. There are several similar reports to this within the BFRO files.",
