            "Observed.1  ": "  The organization, known as BFRO, was founded in 1995 and claims the largest database of credible Bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings throughout the United States and Canada. Besides collecting data, volunteer members do field inquiries throughout the country. This expedition, BFRO's first in Pennsylvania, was initiated on the strength and number of qualified sightings in Adams and Franklin counties, said BFRO founder, Matt Moneymaker. The Waynesboro Reservoir capers, which had caused a stir a few years back, were already a footnote in the \"cases closed\" file. Those oversized footprints, Moneymaker said, had long been debunked as contrived. Talk now centered on a 1997 report from an Adams County hunter who told of seeing three large creatures passing quickly through the woods as he crouched on his tree stand above. A dozen or more seekers, some with their own expensive, hi-tech instruments, came equipped for a scientific search. Most came with stories of their own \u0097 a never-to-be-forgotten sight or sound that kept them wondering. Michael Greene, a retired fraud investigator, owns a thermal imager, which he'd wired to a digital camera worn at his waist, and a night vision scope. Greene's eerie backwoods experience had occurred many years earlier. \"I heard this ungodly loud howl,\" he said slowly, \"unlike anything before. When I heard this same sound later on a recording, my skin went cold. That's how strongly it came back to me.\" Recordings of sounds attributed to [sasquatches] have been collected for years. BFRO maintains a computer file of more commonly heard vocalizations \u0097 from a low moan to a high-pitched whistle \u0097 which are useful in the field. Sound is a new tool that Moneymaker believes will be key in getting a response from [sasquatches]. \"[Bigfoot/Sasquatch] research is in its infancy here [in the eastern U.S.],\" he said. \"In the east, it never got much attention; it had a folkloric association.\" There are informal associations with individuals at northwestern universities, said Moneymaker, but because of the stigma attached to the subject, the group's academic associations are not usually not publicized. On the third night of their vigil, the team set up in a large open tract where they had heard promising evidence the night before. Breaking into four smaller groups, the team kept in touch by radio. Through the heavy, hand-held thermal imager, one pair at a distant point was seen as two clear white clumps under the gray-white stick images of trees. The night was cool and silent, with an occasional barred owl or barking dog raising voice in the distance. Mark Maisel scanned the clearing with night vision binoculars, observing the surreal nature of their quest. \"Bigfoot research is considered a pseudo-science,\" he said. \"But our methods are based on scientific method. We're curious. That's why we're out here.\" Maisel interviews people who report sightings. \"I met with a man once who needed a cigarette before he could even talk,\" he said. \"While he was telling me his story, the hair on his arm stood straight up. He was clearly shaken. You can't make up something like that.\" Paul Mateja, who investigates sighting reports in New York, said he became involved with BFRO after reporting four incidents that occurred to him and his family over a 25-year period in upstate New York. Immersed in the biology of Bigfoot identification, he has kept up a correspondence with primate researcher, W. Henner Fahrenbach of Oregon, who has published works on the Bigfoot phenomenon. Not long ago, Mateja said, his wife heard an awful call at 3:30 a.m. \"The sound was so powerful, it shook the windows of our farm house and woke up the neighbors,\" he said. From time to time, after a signal, one of the crew would bellow into the night, a loud, deep drawn-out call that echoed among the hills. It should have scared up sounds from coyote, birds and deer all across the hillsides, said Maisel, but nothing stirred or called. A recorded scream was played through the amplifier, but as the shrillness faded out, there was only silence. For two nights, there was little to record other than vehicles that frequently hummed along distant roads, shooting lights across the dark woods. Encounter Before the team members had left their campsite for the last night's search, an uncommitted visitor dropped by to meet Moneymaker. Ray Sterner works at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., and in his spare time, he makes maps. His copyrighted relief maps are made available through North Star Publications. Sterner had become acquainted with Moneymaker after learning that one of his maps was appearing unacknowledged on BFRO's Web site. He called to set them straight. Since then, Sterner has prepared the relief maps for BFRO. At the same time, he's disproved two videos that had been submitted as evidence. In one film, what appeared to be a stick thrown across the frame was proven to be an insect that had flown across the lens. \"I'm a skeptic,\" said Sterner. \"You need a lot of proof.\" Sterner and his wife, who live in Carroll County, Md., hike on occasion in Michaux. When he learned Moneymaker would be here, Sterner sought him out. The men conferred briefly, holding an Appalachian Trail map against a tree. Then, huddling at the picnic table with his team, Moneymaker highlighted three possible search routes on the map. Blue marker crisscrossed the black elevation lines printed on the map. \"Excuse me,\" interrupted Sterner. \"That's my map you're using. I'll need it tomorrow if I intend to go hiking.\" Laughter ensued, and Sterner continued. \"Could I have your autograph?\" With the same blue highlighter he'd been using to route a final search, Moneymaker signed the map and handed it back to Sterner. Before they parted, the two shook hands.",

            "Observed.1  ": "We stopped for lunch in a pretty meadow alongside Darlene Lake*.  Spence turned the horses loose to graze while we proceeded to enjoy some cold meat sandwiches, pickles and homemade cookies. As if on signal, the two horses made a complete turnabout and stood facing the trees surrounding the meadow to the south.  They continued to stand, frozen in this position as though hipnotized. Spence said quietly, \"Something's out there!\" In another moment there was a crackling of brush, and the horses commenced to fidgit.  I asked Spence if I could borrow his handgun and go take a look.  (He carries the gun in the event a horse should break a leg, etc.)  I eased into the woods, moved around for awhile, but never saw a thing. We packed up and moved across the trail to find the lakes on the north side.  We found a beauty and were admiring it when, all of a sudden, a roaring growl came from across the lake about 300 feet away.  The horses half-reared and I exclaimed, \"Wow, what was that?\"  Spence replied, \"Mel, I don't know.\"  We listened for a long time but we never heard another sound. Spence and I discussed the incident for most of the way down the trail.  He was with the Forest Service for many years and, after retirement, packed people into the wilderness for hunting and recreation.  He commented, \"I've heard bears bawl, cougars scream and elk bugle, but never a sound like that.\"  We talked about the big grey wolf as a possibility.  The big grey wolf lived in this country in the 1800's, but is thought to be extinct. About the time we returned to the car I hesitatingly mentioned the subject of \"Big Foot.\"  Spence confessed to having thought about it, but was reluctant to mention it to me. I cannot honestly say whether I believe in Bigfoot.  I do, however, know one thing for sure.  When I walk past Cultus Lake this summer, or the Darlene Lakes, I am going to keep my eyes and ears open.  I will probably breathe a little easier when I get well beyong those areas.  Who knows?  Maybe I will see Big Foot.\" *  Investigator's Note:  The Darlene Lakes, consisting of Janet Lake, Peggy Lake and Darlene Lake, are now simply known as The Basin Lakes, and are denoted as such on current maps of the Indian Heaven Wilderness Area.  The Gifford Peak Way Trail that travels through this area is no longer maintained by the USFS. Also of note is that the exact date (day and month) of publishing is not known.  January 1 was used as an arbitrary date for that year.",
