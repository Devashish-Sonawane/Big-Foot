Quote from the witness: \"I did an extensive search of animals sound recordings on the Internet, and didn't find anything quite like what we heard. It was pre-dawn - just a hint of light. At first, I assumed the sound was human. My initial thought was that is was the noise of a man in terrible pain. But then, because of the rhythmic quality of the sound/call, I became convinced it was some sort of animal. The vocal tones were definitely in the range of a male with a deep voice.\"Witness discussed the sound with the other camper at the location, a man in his 60's. He also could not identify the animal.Witness says that they saw two small bears in the area the day before. Apparently there is an old apple orchard in the area, and the bears were in the apple trees eating the apples. There were also several deer visible.",
