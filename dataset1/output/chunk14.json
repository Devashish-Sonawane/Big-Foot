            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.The tall, skinny tree that was across the road was seven inches in diameter and still had the root ball attached. The witness estimated the length in the thirty to fifty foot range. They could not lift the tree but slid it over so they could drive by. Two bricks were stacked by the tree. While collecting firewood at a nearby campsite, he found another five to six foot tree that was broken with a spiral split near the ground. The diameter was four inches. No other trees in the area were damaged. The witness and his two friends found a tent that was flat on the ground with tent stakes in each corner. It was in good condition. At around 9:30pm, they heard a very loud trill vocalization. There were two more trills as it moved very fast. Then what seemed only twenty feet away, at the top of a drop off, four more trills that the witness could feel vibrate his chest. Each vocalization was two to three seconds in duration. The witness had a fight or flight feeling. For four minutes they thought their truck was being pushed. No dents were found but bags inside the truck had fallen over. At about 10:00pm, they heard wood knocks farther away for one-half hour. There would be two to three wood knocks each time, then varying lengths of silence.No other campers were seen in the area but a van did drive by between 11:30pm to midnight. No tracks were found as it snowed the next morning.The witness has camped all his life but never heard a vocalization as this. I find him very credible.  ",
