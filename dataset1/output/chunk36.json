            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and her husband recently moved to Florida. On Tuesday, November 20, 2018 they were returning from the store at approximately 2 pm heading north on Hwy 301; a two lane road in Thonotosassa. It was a sunny day with a high of 77 degrees. The speed limit on Hwy 301 is 60 mph but they were slowing down as their turn was less than \u00bc mile away.  She was the passenger and as they passed over Two Hole Branch Creek she noticed a large bipedal white figure off to the right. It appeared to be stepping over the creek, heading south. It was standing upright and she saw a leg in mid-step. Her sighting was a second or two but she realized it wasn\u0092t a man. It didn\u0092t have clothes or shoes on and it appeared to have white hair all over its body. The height of the figure was hard for her to judge as the road is higher than the creek and she was looking down on it. But it seemed to be similar to a large human. The head appeared rounded, its hands were at its side. She estimated the figure to be about 20 yards from the car. It never looked at the car, it appeared to be walking confidently with purpose.She claimed she had never thought these creatures existed. When her husband mentioned to his brother that his wife may have seen one, the brother told them of a sighting he and his mother had had at their childhood home many years ago in Iowa. His mother confirmed the sighting. They had seen a bigfoot eating mulberries in the yard. The witness, her husband and I went to the location at about the same time of her sighting.The sign she speaks of in her report of saying \u0093Dead River\u0094 is just before the small bridge but refers to the next road, \u0093Dead River Road\u0094 not the name of the creek.The creek is called Two Branch Creek and it is one of the creeks that flows off the Hillsborough River. This section of HWY 301 runs along Hillsborough State Park and the Lower Hillsborough Wilderness Preserve. There is a small bridge over the creek. The witness claims there was more water in the creek in November than the day we were there in March. This is most likely correct as this is Florida\u0092s dry season and the rains don\u0092t really begin until May.The area is heavily treed. The old Atlantic Coastline Railroad used to run along this road. Remnants of it are still visible. (Photo 6) It is about 50 yards away from the highway. Where the railroad was is much higher then the surrounding forest. The bigfoot was walking in between the old railroad and the highway. Footprints around the creek bed were deer, pig, and alligator. It is evident many smaller animals walk the area too.Just east of this area are many strawberry fruit farms. North is a dairy farm. Following the Hillsborough River going north leads to the Green swamp, heading south leads to the Cypress Creek area \u0096 of which both have had many bigfoot reports.",
