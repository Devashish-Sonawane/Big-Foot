            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, he told me about the incident and was accurate and concise. Incident happened several years ago.  Additional details:- The scream lasted 5-10 seconds when he went out for his 3am patrol. He did not go out at his regularly scheduled time. - There is a dumpster for the leftovers, in the back which is close to the forest. - The Scream sounded \"Female\" and was deep and resonant, could not have been generated by a human. Approx 25 yards from the main building and on a ledge/pathway over looking the facility.- Witness has heard sticks breaking on other nights coming from the forest during his patrols. - He did an hourly patrol of the grounds every hour at night. He may have seen a figure a few months earlier in the moonlight. - Woods were patrolled only during daylight hours, once a day. There are many trails in the area.",
