            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness for over an hour and we had an excellent conversation. He was very specific and his recollection was vivid. As he indicated, he and his brother-in-law were driving along the Missouri River in the spring of 2014. It was about 6:30 am and there was enough lighting to see pretty well.They were driving south on the river road which followed the Missouri river. The river road is normally about 25-30 yards from the river, but due to spring rains, the river was 5 yards or less from the road. The following is a description of the creature and the sighting: About 30 yards in front of them a \"soaking wet black creature, jumped from the river side of the road right in front of us\". My headlights reflected off the totally wet creature\". \"We came to a total stop when it appeared\". It was \"big & boxy looking and jumped on one leg from a crouched position\". \"It was huge\".The creature \"stayed in profile to us and we could not get any better physical description\". When it jumped, it kept \"one leg behind him, which I thought was odd\". It also spoke to the incredible power of the creature. The opposite side of the road from where the creature jumped is uphill, so the power it took to get up that hill on one leg was impressive. From the trees as a reference, they concluded it was 8 ft. tall. They saw \"2 wet spots in the road where it jumped from\". The road was otherwise dry. They sat there in stunned silence for a bit, then had a short discussion. The reporting witness knew exactly what he saw but his brother-in-law \"tried to place it in a category\" like a deer, bear or a hunter, etc. He couldn't acknowledge a creature like Sasquatch.The entire event was in the roughly 5 seconds in duration. They chatted a few more minutes then headed off to hunt. For the reporting witness, it was a clearly and undeniably a sasquatch.",
