The hair was long down the back of the animal.- He watched it for ten minutes as it sat on its haunches near the tracks.  He felt it was nervous of him, but not afraid.- The encounter ended when it fluidly stood up and walked away to the north, entering the forest.- He was not close enough to see clear facial details, but he is certain that is was not a man and not a bear.The witness has spent his whole life in the area and knows a great deal about Minnesota wildlife.  I feel he is a very credible and honest witness.",
