            "Observed": "On June the 18th 2007, my daughter and I were going to Whites Run near Seneca Rocks to go trout fishing and camping.  It was very late,around 1:00 in the A.M., with very little moon.  I was coming to the top of a mountain with a speed of around 40 miles an hour on US33/St. Rt. 55. As I reached the top of the mountain two furry looking beings were directly in front of our vehicle and both of them looked at my daughter and I and then took a dive into some bushes on the right shoulder of the hwy.  The funny thing is that they appeared ape like but the fur was short and I am really serious that these two creatures did not run they took a big head first dive into those bushes.  I did fish the next day but as far as camping that was a big OUT, NO WAY on this trip.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Called witness to update the contact information and was presented with a flood of information. She has been a life long outdoor adventurer, scuba diving, hunting, and fishing in many states. She previously worked as a member of the Maryland Forest Service and has seen all of the typical animals which existed (until now) in the eastern hardwood forest. She and her daughter were enroute to a camping location when they encountered several upright bipedal mammals walking near Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area. The witness saw two animals but her daughter identified a third, walking ahead of the others. Human night vision changes as we age. Every 10 years night vision deteriorates as part of the aging process, requiring twice as much light to see at the same level. Naturally, her 15 year old daughter has better night vision.The sighting lasted about 10 seconds, just enough for the two animals to look at the approaching vehicle, then dive out of the roadway. The witness was surprised they did not run or step off the road but literally dove head first into the brush. She stated that the eyes looked much like a graphic once displayed on the BFRO website home page. Recently the two ladies returned to West Virginia. Upon making a wrong turn westbound on to US 33, her daughter said, \"you're on the wrong road, turn around.\" She did not want to revisit the sighting location. ",
