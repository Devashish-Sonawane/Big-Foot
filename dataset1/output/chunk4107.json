            "Observed.1  ": "\"I know this is going to sound crazy,\u0094 said the woman in a call to Bedford dispatch on September 9.  The woman told the dispatcher she was driving up Route 43, toward the Peaks of Otter, around 11:40p.m. on September 9.  She said her headlights hit something strange past Turkey Mountain Road, just before the first bridge.  This is part of her conversation with a dispatcher on September 11. Caller: \"I know this is going to sound crazy, but I went back and checked and there were prints, a Bigfoot with a baby.\" Dispatcher: \"There were what?\" Caller: \"It was a Bigfoot with a baby.\" After assuring the dispatcher she hadn't been drinking, the woman offered no explanation why she waited two days to call.  She says she went back in daylight. Caller: \"I did see some footprints and the stride was longer than anything I could make.\" The woman says the creature's footprint was bigger than her two feet together, end to end.  She wears a size 8 shoe.  She says the creature was holding its baby the way a human would. Caller: \"The baby was looking right at me.\" The woman told ABC 13 the baby looked just like Chewbacca from \u0093Star Wars\u0094.  Caller: \"Have you ever gotten other reports like this?\" Dispatcher: \"I've never had a call like this in my life.\" The dispatcher told the woman he\u0092s worked in dispatch 10 years. A deputy checked out the area and didn't see anything. The woman said she knows they were not bears.  We've got a call in to a state biologist to see if he can explain what she may have seen.",
