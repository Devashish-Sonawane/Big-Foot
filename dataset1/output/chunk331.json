            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness who submitted the report, as well as a second witness to the incident. Both were adamant as to the details of the encounter. An additional detail from the on-site interview was that one of the witnesses was a pre-teen who had been crying loudly earlier in the evening. The group began hearing screams from the top of the ridge and up the mountain from the stream side camp site. There were 2-3 that were 15 to 20 minutes apart prior to hearing something moving down the hill and toward the camp site.The creature came down the hill side and stepped out in front of a tree that overhung the creek. The stream was about 30 feet from the fire, and about 4 feet wide at that point.  It squatted by the side of the stream in full view of the campers. Its hands were in the water, and it stared back at the campers with no fear. The encounter lasted approximately 1 minute. The creature then stood up and walked back around the tree. The witnesses could hear it moving back up the mountain and away from the stream. The head was rounded and sat on the shoulders. The eyes were amber in color. The arms hung almost to the knees and the legs were muscular with big calves. They could clearly see the feet on stream edge.This report is interesting, in that it could have been the crying of the child that drew the attention of the animal. This has been noted in several reports where children are present during sightings.The witness had another incident in September of 2008 while camping near this area. They returned to camp and heard something run away. The second night they felt something was lurking around the camp all night. They heard wood being broken during the night and found 3 inch diameter pine trees snapped off about at about 4 foot in height in a pattern that suggested a trail. ",
