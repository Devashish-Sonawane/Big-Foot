Bears frequent the area because there is an abundance of brine fly larvae along the edge of the lake.

We arrived around 7 p.m.  My friend didn\u0092t want to be there in the dark but I am an intuitive medium and I have no fear of the dark with the things I deal with. I have been to Days River Trail many times during my lifetime but only within this last year has this place been an interest to me to see what it feels like at night. We decided to walk the outer trail once we cross the bridge over the river. We took a right after the bridge and before we hit the corner we looked up and saw this light, high up to our left, up over a small ridge. It was a bright light, shining but not moving at all. Still. We took our mini flashlights and were trying to see what it was or where it was coming from and then started talking loud and it did not move, not at all. We kept walking, not long after the first corner we heard something walking to our right which is on the river side and it would have been down an embankment. It was definitely on two feet not 4. I grew up in the country and know a lot of what animals sound like.  My friend was worried and asked me what I thought, I didn\u0092t want her to run so I said I think it\u0092s a deer let\u0092s keep moving.  We got farther into the woods and started looping in the inside trails and it was a beautiful night, not too cold and somewhat clear out.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with Tammy originally on 1/20/17 after she contacted me through the UPBSRO Facebook Page. We met at a local public place and talked about her encounter for about an hour and a half. We then set plans to meet at the location.On 1/22/17 we met at the Days River Trail around 5 pm. Tammy and I walked the trails talking about her and her friends experience and she showed me the places where things happened. As we walked I did get a feeling of being watched once we crossed the bridge from the parking area to the trails. I placed a recorder on my car, had a second on my person and had a parabolic mic with a recorder on it with us as well. As we progressed through the trails we found a few tree breaks. This is the first tree break we found walking the trails. It is around 5 feet off the snow pack. At one point I stepped off the trail to take pictures of three tree breaks that formed a triangle, here are the photos:As I stepped off the trail, Tammy and I both turned to look at each other and asked \"Do you hear that?\". What we were hearing what sounded like something circling us and then walking through or brushing up against thick brush. As we stood there and listened we were also watching trough the rows of planted red pines, but could not see anything. After this we continued on our walk and spotted a bright light glowing just across a ridge, as we approached it we were not sure what it could be. (It turns out it is a dusk to dawn light at the golf course neighboring the trails.) After checking that out we continued back toward the parking lot. As we came to a spot where the trail gets close to the creek the hair on the back of my neck started to stand up and I got a real uneasy feeling, almost like something was telling me \"don't be here\". I asked Tammy if she was feeling anything with out telling her what I was feeling and she confirmed she was having the same feelings and that this is the area that has given her the creeps every time she has come out here.Since our first meeting and conversation Tammy has continued to go out and research the area. She has also found this recording on YouTube that closely resembles the sounds she has heard at the location -  Headphones are helpful in listening to this the cries are at 9 seconds and 30 seconds.The Days River Trail area has the right mix of cover, water and food to hold a Bigfoot or small family group. While there is some human action right near the trailhead, to the north is mostly uninhabited State Forest. There have been reports of bears and cougars in the area in the past so it can and has held other large predators. There is also a Meat Processor down and across the road from the trailhead. ",
