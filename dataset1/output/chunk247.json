I was out walking at Douglas County Park with my boyfriend, his friend and my youngest son who was 3 at the time. We walked back past the corn field and worked our way to the bridge that crossed a creek just before you hit the heavy wooded area. I was tossing leaves in the creek on one side of the bridge and Ethan would run to the other side to look for it floating down stream.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On June 28, 2013 I spoke with Christina regarding the incident. Christina, her fiance, her son, and a friend had stopped by a pedestrian bridge on the edge of Donald Park. She was dropping sticks and leaves into the stream and watching them float away when they heard a series of knocks coming from a nearby marshy area. The knocks were a series of three rhythmic knocks. The pattern repeated itself three or four times. After a few moments the knocking stopped, and the group decided to head back to their car. As they turned to leave they heard a howl-like moan on the hill opposite to the marsh where the knocks were heard. It was a distinct sound and definitely not a coyote. I found Christina to be a very compelling witness who did not waiver from her story, or embellish it in any way.Donald Park is located in the town of Springdale along two trout streams, southeast of Mt. Horeb off Highway 92, just west of Mt. Vernon. The Donald/Woodburn family donated the original 105 acres for this park. The park has since grown to encompass 480 acres containing oak woods, intriguing rock outcroppings with scenic vistas and springs. Donald Park is also known for its trout streams - Deer Creek, Frye Feeder, and Mt. Vernon Creek.",
