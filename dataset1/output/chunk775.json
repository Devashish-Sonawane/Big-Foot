            "Follow-Up Report": "On the May 8, 2001, I telephoned TR, and tried to get a little better direction and location of the tracks that she and her father observed above the Kennedy Meadows campground.  On the May 12, 2001, a friend and I went to the above mentioned campground.  We made a two mile plus trek up the South Fork of the Kern River, from the Kennedy Meadows campground between the river and the Pacific Coast Trail, but failed to locate her bigfoot tracks, reason possibly being the fact that numerous fishermen and backpackers have been using that area since April 24, 2001.  We observed many fresh human boot prints, some old bear tracks, and numerous fresh deer tracks.  On May 25, 2001, I again called TR and advised her of our findings and attempted to gain any other pertinent information on the subject.  TR and her family have made many trips to this area over the years, and have had several suspicious things happen to them.  A few years ago, her brother observed something dark moving through trees very fast which he thought may have been on two legs.  TR and her dad know what bear tracks look like, but the tracks that they encountered were bare foot with five toes, squarish looking, and the stride was much longer than any human that they could identify with. On my first phone call to TR, I asked about the 12\" measurement of the tracks when she made her original report, and she stated that on the report, they were probably a little short by a couple of inches.

            "Also Noticed": "I had an incident at my own house one night about 2 or 3 am. I woke up to hearing a low, loud snarling sound and then whatever it was, took a breath and started snarling again. My little bassett hound was outside and when the second snarl started, he started freaking out, barking, yelping, going nuts and so I jumped out of bed and ran to open the door to let him in. I thought it was a coyote, because we have coyotes here that have killed my neighbors cats and a few newborn calves have gone missing, completely missing, no sign of them at all. Anyway, the smell was horrendous when I opened the door. My dog was backed up to the door and when I opened it, he darted into the house and I closed the door. I went back to bed and tried to wake my husband to tell him about the smell. I didn't know coyotes smelled so bad. But now, after seeing this, I am certain there was a bigfoot beside my porch and he or she was about to get my bassett hound. I never let him outside during the night again, unless I went outside with him.",

I came around the last curve of the road where it straightens out towards ________. I looked down at the temperature on my car and it said 86 and I saw a blue SUV coming towards me in the other lane. I thought nothing of the SUV until this tall creature stepped onto the road and in two steps had crossed the lane I was driving in and was into the left lane and my view of it was then obstructed. It was completely covered in thick hair, all the way to the pavement. I couldn't see any feet and it was about 1/8 mile away so I didn't see any facial features. The head did not bob up and down as it walked. It just went straight across the road. I have never seen anything move so quickly. I've seen lots of animals cross the road in that general vicinity because there are not many houses or much development, and I have NEVER seen that. I did not believe in Bigfoot and teased my husband because he believed. I will never doubt another sighting report. The hair of the chest was slightly orange in the bright sunshine. It moved so fast I was unable to see it's face but I saw the right arm swing back and the left arm swing back and then it stepped out of view. I kept driving towards it and the SUV and I thought I might flag that SUV down and ask if they saw it but when it got close to me, but decided not to. The hair kind of stood up above the head. I would say it had a sort of flat forehead and kind of a pointy head. The hair seemed to be standing above it's head but there wasn't any wind. I would be happy to show some BFRO person exactly where this happened and explain it to them if someone wants to contact me or come here for a visit.",

He said it was further down the road towards Lakeland and it was late at night. He thought someone had thrown out a piece of old furniture and it was standing on end, like a fuzzy sofa or something but when he got close to it, he realized it was a bigfoot. He turned his truck around really fast but it was gone.",
