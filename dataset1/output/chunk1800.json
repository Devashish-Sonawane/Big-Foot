Over the years we have experienced several instances of wood knocking and did not think much of it in all honesty. More recently we have stumbled upon small trees (4-5 inches in diameter) that were twisted/broken in ways that a human could not achieve (in our opinion). All these instances combined over the years have not really made us feel unsettled or afraid, nor did we think it was anything too worthy of note; however, our most recent experience, which occurred over a period of a few days in September 2020, was unexplainable and I cannot go without reporting this any longer, as it has truly been bothering me since it occurred.",

Only rarely has she seen another person on this trail. Hunting season is when she has seen others out there. She says there are always lots of deer tracks on Stone Church trail in all seasons.The figure was up on the ridge directly to the south of her position on the trail. It was approximately 50 yards away. She saw it for 6-10 seconds before it crested the ridge and went out of view. Her husband was further back on the trail when the sighting happened. He didn't see it.A few days later she returned with her husband and asked him go up to where she saw the figure. Her husband is 5'6''.  She said the figure was at least one foot taller than her husband. The body much more robust. There was full sunlight. She is certain the figure was all dark and covered with fur.She has been to the location many times since those observations, at the same time every day, except the weekends where her walk schedule varies. She hadn't seen or heard anything else relevant until February 13, 2021 when she heard a distinct wood knock.For the Google Maps pin for the location where the witness was standing, click here.]",
