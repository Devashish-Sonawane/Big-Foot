            "Observed": "I was out side going to the bathroom by a creek (aprox. 20 feet away) and from across the creek (35 yds away)I here a hooting/ howling from a crop of trees. I immediately go inside. we heard the sound from inside the Yurt (25 feet from creek)2 more times. later that night (30 min) I went outside with a flash light to survey the hill side, when I seen a faint outline of something duck behind a group of trees. I immediately go inside. The next morning I went outside to check things out and there was a footprint leading towards the front door of the yurt. It is a very steep hill leading to the Yurt so the print was only the ball of the foot and the first 3 toes. embedded in the muddy print were several small white/brown hairs that I collected. there was also a hair on the door. My friend and I have been hearing this sound for months but much deeper in the mountains, never this close. My friends dad has been hearing the same sound from deep in the mountains since he moved there in 1984.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After interviewing the witness on the phone and in-person, I found him to be lucid, articulate, and consistent. He recounted the event and described the sheer bone-rattling volume of the close-in subject vocalizations while the witness(es) were in the yurt (a type of tent but stronger). Because of private property issues, the witness declined to visit the site of the event with me. He did give me one very small indeterminate hair sample collected adjacent to the trackway, which appeared to be brownish-red, curled, and missing follicle material. Further analysis yielded inconclusive results. The witnesses' encounter is consistent with previously collected reports, and merits further in-depth field investigation.",
