It was about 2:30 when I was walking down the road in Powell co.I had stop to rest,I heard a big splash in the river. I looked around and saw a big shape in the water.I at first thought it was a bear but it stood up it looked like it was fishing. I don't know how deep the water is but it looked like it was standing about four feet out of the water, and had long shaggy hair.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. The witness related that he actually smelled a bad odor before he heard the splashing. \"It stank, really horrible, then I heard a splash.\" He was about 60 feet from the creature, which was moving around and splashing in the river. The witness thought it might have been fishing. It was a clear night. \"I could see the body shape; it was pretty broad across the shoulders. It was big! It had a long head, not really pointed, bit sort of cone shaped. It didn't look like it had much of a neck. The hair looked kind of long, about like a Irish Setter.\" The witness could not see any facial features. He estimated the height to be at least six or seven feet. The hair was dark in color. The witness hurried down the road, but since the road parallels the river at this point, he had the creature in view for several minutes. \"Once it stopped and kind of looked around, then it went back to what it was doing.\"",
