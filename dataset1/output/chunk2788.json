For years they thought it was a bear...but it was bipedal during the entirety of the encounter.  One witness stated he dropped his gun to gain speed as he fled.",

'K' expressed an interest in attending a BFRO Expedition to try to learn more about this elusive species. I hope she will be able to join us in the field in the near future.",
