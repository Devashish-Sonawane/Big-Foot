            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was credible.  Because the leaves were off the trees and vegetation had not regrown, she was able to see it.Although she was unable to see fine detail because of the distance, what she viewed was too large to be a bear and characteristic of a Bigfoot:  Height, weight, shape, coned-shaped head and long arms.The creature was sighted down an unnamed road to the East about a mile south of Worlds End Road on the north, and Green Lake Road to the south. It was in a clearing that formerly was a dump, now cleared.The creature seen was about a thousand feet away. She couldn't determine whether she was viewing the front or back, but knew it was huge, between 7.5 and 8.5 feet tall.  She saw long arms almost to the knees, pointed head, broad four-foot shoulders. Unlike a bear, the arms were down to the sides and much longer than front bear legs.  Witness was reluctant to guess a weight, but she thought it was very heavy.  She did not notice a neck. She was sure it did not have paws such as a bear.It was too far away to nice facial details. It was a bit bowlegged.This is an area of ample food sources both vegetable and animal.  There are plenty of lakes, streams and marshes in the area but no known caves.Witness is a Native American and a resident of the LCO Reservation.The kids were occupied with their phones which explains why none of them had an opportunity to see it.",
