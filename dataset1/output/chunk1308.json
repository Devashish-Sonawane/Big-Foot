            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the individual regarding his incident.  His recollection was clear and to the point.  He indicated to me that he was searching for a clearing on the creek in order to return and fish.  He did not have any gear with him at the time because he was strictly surveying the surroundings on foot. When he reached a clearing at the creek about fifty yards from the bridge, he noticed two tracks on either side of the 6-ft wide creek.  The right foot imprint was closest to him while the left footprint was on the other side of the creek. He also noticed that they were in soft soil and were approximately 4 inches deep and filling with water.  It was at this moment that he also smelled a foul odor resembling vomit, feces, sweat and rotted meat.  This is where he felt as though he was being watched. As he began to look around him to determine what was causing the odor, he heard loud knocking sounds as though something was smacking two stick together.  I asked him, \u0093what would be required to mimic the sound?\"  He stated that one would need a couple of sticks about two inches in diameter to reproduce the same sound.  Upon hearing these sounds, he immediately left the area.  The knocking repeated many times as he was pushing his way through the bushes and running back to his car where his wife was waiting.  The knocking was heard again as he reached his car.  I asked him about the breathing he heard and he replied, \"I\u0092m not sure if it was my own or from something else\u0094.  He explained to me that his fear and adrenaline was so great by this time that his breathing was excessively loud and he could not make any clear, detailed observations.The witness has not returned to the area since his incident and will not without someone joining him.  He then invited me to accompany him in returning to the exact location. I take this person to be very credible and sincere as to his recounting the experience.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness/observer by phone on January 9, 2012. This sighting occurred at approximately 1:00 am on Sunday, October 2, 1983. The weather was clear, dry and air temperature was in the mid 60\u0092s.Observer and his wife recalled driving north on NC 17, approximately 1-2 miles past the town of Holly Ridge, when they approached what the witness initially thought was a large bear. Illuminated in the car headlights, the witness remembers a massive, hairy, bipedal animal walking south on the right shoulder of the road in opposition to his direction of travel. Length of observation time was about fifteen seconds.Witness describes the animal's height in the range of 7-8 feet tall, with weight estimated at six hundred pounds. Hair color was brown with reddish highlights and about 2 inches or more in length. He slowed his vehicle to a crawl and was able to observe most of the upper body features, particularly the face, very clearly. He recalls it as different from an ape's face, more elongated, and hairless around the eyes/cheeks. Facial skin was described as reddish/chocolate colored and lighter than the surrounding hair. No beard or other lengthy head hair was detected. The head was large, sloped back to the top, and the forehead area between the brow line and top of the head estimated at 6-7 inches. The brow was hair-covered and very prominent. The eyes were darker colored, elliptical shaped and fixed forward. The nose was hairless, but not massive or wide; nostrils were visible.The mouth was wide and hairless. The neck was not prominent and observer described the head as blending into the shoulders. He describes the body as stocky, somewhat muscular, and shoulder to shoulder measurement was thought to be approximately 3 feet wide. The torso was hair covered and chest muscles not overly prominent. No female breasts were observed, thus leaving witness with the opinion that this was a male animal. Arms were described as hair covered, excessively long, and extended to the animal's knees. Hands were described as \u0093balled up\u0094 and hairless. Clenched hands were darker colored than the face, and no finger length estimate or nail description could be recalled. Thighs were described as muscular and about twice the girth of an adult human. Observer did not remember any details of lower legs/feet. No odor was detected, although the windows of the car were rolled up during the event.  Observer states that during this experience the animal ignored the car, was unaffected by the headlights or occupants and continued moving south as if it were \u0093on a mission.\u0094 Its gaze remained forward as it moved past his vehicle, never turning its head to look in any other direction. The witness states the animal moved at a moderate walking pace, its arms were swinging in a normal bipedal manner. It issued no vocalizations, made no audible footfalls, nor could he hear it breathing. It did not appear to be injured or carrying any visible items. No other travelers were on the road during this experience; his wife was asleep in the passenger\u0092s seat and did not observe the animal. The witness was not threatened during the event; he remembers feeling amazed, mesmerized and unafraid of this animal. Below is a drawing by the witness of what he saw:I found this witness to be a very sincere and credible observer who likely viewed an adult sasquatch. The area surrounding this sighting remains primarily rural. Nearby Holly Shelter Game Land is a 75,120 acre Nature Conservancy tract typical of the Southeastern NC coastal plain. The area is composed of pine forest, flatlands, savannahs, dense swamps and pocosins. Animal populations abound and include deer, boar, bear, and various small game. The area surrounding Onslow County, North Carolina and the 246 square mile Camp Lejeune Marine Base has produced similar unusual animal reports on roadways as far back as 1987.",
