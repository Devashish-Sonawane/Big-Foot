            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed both gentlemen via telephone. The primary witness who submitted the report is a police detective and Army veteran. The encounter occurred when he was 14 years old. He and his best friend (who is still his best friend) were riding their bicycles near his home one evening. The property is rural, and loggers had clear cut large areas about a year before.  The area had not been replanted yet, and blackberry bushes had grown over the clear cuts.  The boys rode down a logging road to a hollow where they always found deer feeding. The bank was high, and he even remembers telling his friend that the winds would be favorable for them to watch without the deer catching their scent. They sat on their bikes behind blackberry briars and watched the deer. When the deer alerted, they searched the hill looking to see what alerted them. They then saw a very tall man swiftly walking toward the deer. It was about 150-200 yards away, under the canopy of some hard wood trees. They both thought at first it was a 6\u00925\u0094 tall neighbor wearing dark clothing. As it rapidly walked closer, they realized it was much taller than the neighbor and wasn\u0092t a man.  When it was about 30 yards away from them, they identified it as a bigfoot. Frightened, both boys flipped their bikes around and rode away. The witness remembers as he pedaled home pulling out his pocket knife in fear. The boys spoke about it at first to their parents, who didn\u0092t want to talk about it. They then didn\u0092t speak of it for years even with each other, but do now. After the encounter, both did not go out at dusk or dark again.  His friend would not return to his house to play \u0096 they would play at the friend\u0092s house which was miles away.Other details remembered and confirmed by both witnesses :-The bigfoot was at least 7 feet tall.-It was bipedal with a very smooth, fluid, and fast gait.-It had long legs, and was swinging its long arms as it walked with purpose.-It had a V shaped torso with big shoulders and slim hips.-Its color was dark brown or black and solid in color.-It made no noise walking, even when it got close to them.Google Earth View of Area:",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I called this witness on 1/16/18 to establish contact. A short time later my wife and I went to visit the site.During our initial phone conversation the witness described many typical sasquatch related occurrences. He also stated that so much activity is going on day-to-day that he has begun ignoring it. The activity started ten years ago the same day that they moved-in to the home. Behind his home there is a slope going uphill into a very large tract of timber company property. About 75 yards away there is a shallow draw that drains over to a creek that flows through his property. He described seeing two red eyes over by that shallow draw. Later, when we visited the site, I had him show me where the eyes were. Then he went back to where he stood when he saw them. I raised my hand until it was about the same height as he remembered them. My arm was outstretched above me as far as I could reach. This would indicate that the individual standing there was around eight feet tall.The witness raises turkeys. There is a pen that is between his house and where he said that the eyes were. Periodically, a turkey would disappear. He began to watch what was going on. When a turkey nested within arm's reach of the fence, then it would not be there in the morning. The surviving turkeys all nested roosted in the middle of the pen, out of arm's reach.The witness is also an archer. He set up 3-D targets in the woods to the north-west of his house. One morning he found his javalina target busted-up (they come in several sections that have to be assembled like a 3-D puzzle). There were scratch marks, looking like fingernails and there was the outline and indentions from what looked like a bite. The bite marks looked human in shape, but much larger, more the size of horse teeth. The witness has no horses. Also reported is the sound of voices. He can\u0092t understand what they are saying, and has come to call them the \u0093jabbering Chinese man\u0094.  Occasionally he hears yelling from the forest property to the north. He hears wood knocks at all times of the day and night, as well as branch-breaks. Often, he hears the sound of something or someone walking on two legs in the forest. He also finds items out of place, moved around, and often finds rocks left on top of vehicles and equipment. On-site investigation. My wife and I visited his property a few days after talking with him on the phone. We observed that the location is at the edge of a large tract of timber company land. There is brush and forest within 50 yards of his home where a sasquatch could observe the home. As mentioned before, we were able to get an estimate of the height of the observed red eyes. We found a track impression near the turkey pen. It was about 15 inches long and six inches wide. He showed me the places where rocks are left sitting on top of pieces of equipment. This is very similar to what I have observed at other locations in similar situations. The location is in some of the best low-land habitat in the area. There are mines and caves around, large tracks of forest that connect with forest all the way to the Cascades. There are power-lines near-by that provide easy travel routes. Deer, elk, small game animals, and birds are plentiful in the area. ",
