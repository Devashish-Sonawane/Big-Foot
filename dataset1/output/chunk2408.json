            "Follow-Up Report": "The first part of this report is the newest as I have continued with this investigation.  I have included several videos that highlight some of the further research and recordings that have happened since this report was first published.\u0093Singing Howls\"\"Double Howl\"\u0093Whistle and Shriek\"\u0093Real-Time Investigation\"There are more videos from this and other BFRO investigations on YouTube, just look for Lordcryptid.Here is the beginning of the report as it was first published:I began researching the report from the witnesses in part because I was looking into sightings in Central Michigan for the Animal Planet show Finding Bigfoot.  While I was specifically tasked with finding cases involving sightings this case intrigued me because I attended college nearby and had heard of a history of interesting reports from this area.I contacted the witnesses and they sent the vocalizations they had recorded with their video camera.  Immediately on hearing the first few moments of audio I was impressed with what seemed to be out there.  I heard what appeared to be communication between multiple vocalizers, mimicry of farm animals, and even interaction between humans and whatever it was in the woods.I set up a day to drive to the location and meet with the witnesses.  On February 25th I arrived at the farm the witnesses own.  The witnesses were matter-of-fact and very personable.  I knew I was going to enjoy my stay but even though I was excited about the recordings I did not expect anything to happen. I was introduced to their horse, which I was told could predict nights when activity would occur.  I was shown how to milk goats.  I watched how you keep the water for the cows warm in the winter.  Then we took a walk in the woods a day after a fresh snowfall had occurred.  The snow was between one to one and a half feet deep.  The land area around the location contains open water in the form of rivers and a cedar swamp.  There are numerous fields that have not been utilized for years.  The trees in the area are filled with tree stands for the plentiful deer.  We found an area where a sizeable deer herd had been bedding down for at least the past few days.  We eventually walked an area of four square miles and found deer tracks everywhere and plenty of cover, and warmer temperatures, particularly in the pines.When we returned to the farm we noticed that the horse was running around his corral and kicking up its back legs.  \"We are going to have a visitor tonight,\" I was told.  We decided that we would sit outside once it became dark and see if we could elicit any responses from the woods by tree knocking.  The witness stated that she had received responses to her calls and so we tried these as well.  I did not hear any responses to the knocks or calls we initiated but the witness did and subsequent review of the recordings proved that she was correct.  Distant wood on wood knocking could be heard in the woods.At around 9 pm I set out a recorder in the middle of a field and left it to get some dinner.  We then went about the evening chores. We heard dogs barking a few miles away.  You could hear the different dogs begin barking and the ones that were closer to the property were the last to begin barking.  On the ground it appeared as if something was making the dogs bark and moving in our direction.  Soon coyotes began to join in the cacophony.  However, we believed that we could hear something different along with the known animals.  We heard high pitched whoops and whistles.  Occasionally we could hear what sounded like screams and moans.  This was later verified when we reviewed the recordings.  One of the howls recorded was similar to what is commonly referred to as the 1994 Ohio Moan.After things had calmed down we walked out to the recorder in the field.  What we subsequently learned was that about fifteen minutes before we left to pick up the recorder something walked within 100 feet of the device.  Initially I thought this was me coming to pick it up but later you can hear the barn door shut and three of us walking out to pick up the recorder.  After reviewing the recordings I called the witnesses and asked them to check the area around the recorder for possible prints or signs of activity but it had rained that day and the snow had been melted.  As I was standing alone near the where I had placed the recorder I heard what I can only describe as a male sounding voice from the wood line 100 yards away which seemed to be talking but I could not make out what was being said.  It was the only \"voice\" I heard at that time but it was nearing midnight and the nearest home was one mile away.  It almost seemed as if the voice was directed at me and left me wanting to leave the area.  Review of the audio shows what sounds like gibberish but cannot replicate the feeling that I should vacate the area.By 12:15 a.m. I was preparing for the three hour drive home and thanking the witnesses for their hospitality and planning another visit.  We discussed the vocalizations we heard and I promised to send them what I had recorded.  We were standing in the driveway about 100 yards from the woods.  I had just recommended that the witnesses wait around after I drove away to see if they heard anything from the woods as I have found that sometimes there are audible \"all clear\" notifications given in the form of wood knocking or vocalizations.  At this point I had my recorder in my hand and captured something growling very loudly at us.  Then there were multiple vocalizers howling from differing parts of the woods.  This lasted twenty-one minutes and as time progressed the vocalizations moved further and further away.  The witnesses stated that this is how it happens every third night or so in the winter but almost every night in the spring and summer.  The horse reacts strangely, then the dogs to the south-west begin barking, the coyotes and farm animals act up; the vocalizations are then very close and eventually move away.  The whole process from dogs barking to the end of the event normally lasts for over an hour.Since that date I have kept in regular contact with these witnesses.  We have multiple recorders capturing everything that goes on in the woods.  As of the date of this report I have about 210 hours of analyzed recordings.  An ongoing recording process will continue in this location.  One example from the collected audio is below and shows the possible interaction between two individuals in differing parts of the woods.  Whoops and a single wood knockUpdate: The BFRO Investigator, Jim Sherman, continues to work with the witness and maintains a continuous audio collection project at this research locale. BFRO Investigator D.K. from Virginia, a former cryptologic linguist now studying sasquatch vocalizations, is a collaborator in this project and has isolated the following vocalizations which suggest the persistent presence of multiple, suspected sasquatch at this location.Howls\u0095 July 1, 2011 - Howl, Moan Howl, Two Howls\u0095 January 22, 2012 - Vocal and Moan Howl\u0095 January 23, 2012 - Howl, Singing Howls\u0095 March 14, 2012 - Three Howls\u0095 March 15, 2012 - Howls\u0095 March 16, 2012 - Four Moan Howls, Howl, Woo Aaa Vocal\u0095 March 31, 2012 - Vocals\u0095 April 2, 2012 - Long Howl\u0095 April 3, 2012 - Woo Vocals, More Woo Vocals\u0095 April 4, 2012 - Knock and Howl\u0095 June 30, 2012 - HowlWhoops\u0095 July 1, 2011 - Whoop\u0095 March 31, 2012 - Three Whoops\u0095 April 2, 2012 - Three Whoops\u0095 April 3, 2012 - WhoopShrieks\u0095 July 1, 2011 - Howl and Shriek\u0095 August 1, 2011 - Shrieks and Moan HowlVarious Vocals\u0095 April 1, 2012 - Many Vocals\u0095 April 3, 2012 - Various Vocals\u0095 June 17, 2012 - Roars and Vocals\u0095 July 2, 2012 - Roar and Vocals\u0095 August 31, 2012 - Various Vocals\u0095 July 15, 2012 - Woos and Whoops",

            "Observed": "I was rifle deer hunting. Waiting \"on stand\" -watching a mountainside. The \"driver\" (other hunter who was walking the mountainside to drive out a deer to the stander (me). The hunter I was expecting to see was my brother. I had a clear view of the mountainside-there was a lone pine tree with a fallen log in front of it. It was mid-morning, good weather-clear day and view. I was watching the mountainside when it walked into view. I assumed it was my brother because it walked like a man-upright. It was all in brown. In retrospect, I should have realized right away that it wasn't my brother because of the clothing. It stopped beside the tree and stood there. I had the feeling it could see me.  I thought about putting my rifle scope on it, but thought my brother might not appreciate that,so didn't. After a few seconds, it dropped down to all fours & disappeared out of my view. That was when I realized it couldn\"t have been my brother, so I thought it must have been a bear. Then a few minutes later my brother did appear-in the same place-I could tell right away that it was him & what I had seen was a lot bigger and taller. I have never forgotten the incident-although my family and friends all said it was a bear-I have seen lots of bear in my life and I'm sure it wasn't a bear. I thought it was a man when I first saw it. It walked like and stood like a man-thought it was in a brown coverall or something. Never have seen anything like it since.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the woman on the phone as she vividly recounted her experience in 1974. She was articulate, lucid, and a very credible witness, and went on to describe seeing what she initially thought to be a \"man in light brown coveralls\" from approximately 150 yards while seated in a deer draw during an early morning hunt in the Umatilla National Forest. She appeared to have a high degree of aptitude with matters relating to hunting and local wildlife.She mentioned that at first she thought it was her brother who was in the approximate area \"driving\" deer to her stand. She stated that she did not think much of it immediately, since the creature nonchalantly walked upright along the side of the ridge with a gate \"very similar to a man\" and approached the pine tree, put its hand on the tree, and then turned to look at her. She described feeling very strongly at the time that the creature was looking straight at her. After a few moments of this behavior, the creature \"dropped to all fours\" and scampered with some degree of speed up the side of the ridge, out of sight.She said at that point she began to wonder if the creature was a bear, but noted that in all of her experience in the woods with bears she had never seen a bear \u0093walk like a man\". She explained that she later wished that she had viewed the creature in her rifle scope, but since she initially thought it was her brother, she felt that \"he would not have appreciated her drawing down on him\".When her brother did approach the area adjacent to the pine tree shortly after the creature left, she described a sudden realization that this was a very unique experience in that her brother was much smaller in stature than the creature, and dressed in \"blue jeans and hunting jacket, not brown coveralls.\" Her brother was completely unaware of any unusual presence in the location.The witness maintained that she has never forgot about the experience, it has stuck with her, and she felt that it was important to describe the experience formally for the record.",
