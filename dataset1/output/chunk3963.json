She said it looked like a man but was covered with dark hair.  She said she could see the moon reflected in its eyes (which implies that the eyes were set in front, not on the side like a bear's).  I made no noise but it watched them, turning it's head as the passed.  The three walked home arm in arm with one walking backward to see if the thing was following them.",
