There were no campfires allowed in the area we were in, so it got dark fairly quick. At around 7pm, a really loud howling sound began not too far away from where we were camped. It sounded like a primate, hooting and howling out in the mountain. It lasted about 10 or 15 seconds, and then stopped. After about midnight, when we were in our tents and trying to go to sleep, twigs and branches were snapping around our tent. Things were being moved, thrown around. My boyfriend got up and loaded his rifle, and lay back down. Whatever it was went away for a little bit. At around 3 in the morning, another ear-piercing scream not ten feet away from our campsite echoed off the trees. We stayed awake after that, and something pulled the tent stake out of the ground on our friends tent a little while later. We got out and looked around, but couldnt see much because it stayed in the treeline. It felt like there were more than one, because it kept hitting sticks against the trees and breaking branches. After the sun came up, whatever it was went away.",

The loud howling did not begin until after they beat          on a tree with a machete.    2.)  They were able to see what appeared to be white          eyeshine in the tree line.    3.)  The eyeshine was later measured at over seven feet          against a known tree.    4.)  There was a very pungent odor present that smelled          as if the animal had rolled in garbage.    5.)  After daylight they were able to see a dark figure          moving in the tree line about twenty yards away.    6.)  Several deep footprints were found near the creek.",

The next morning my father and I went back out to where I saw the creature. I climbed into my ladder stand and my father went to the draw where I saw the creature and walked the same path and the creature I saw was at least 2 feet taller then my father my stands father 6 feet 4.",
