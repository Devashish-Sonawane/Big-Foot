It took me several viewings of the video to actually see the thing, it's so small in the frame. It is at best two or three scanlines tall as shot, and because of this there's really nothing I can do to the image that would be worthwhile. It's not going to prove anything, either way.  LeRoy, thanks for sending it to me. It's always worth a look, in my opinion.",
