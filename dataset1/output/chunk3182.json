            "Observed": "I was taking a walk up the path I had been excavating through my woods. I had been doing this by hand the previous day. I wanted to make a loop path through the thick vine maple and hazelnut brush on my property, when I suddenly got spooked for no discernable reason. I stopped and looked around, when I was growled at by something that sounded like a dog back in the woods. I had my gun, and thinking it was a coyote, I advanced and heard it running through the woods. Later, I looked around by the front of my woods behind my burnpile, and found odd looking feces. Full of a light colored hair. The next day, I went into my woods again early in the morning, and in the same spot, I heard a loud knocking like someone with at least a six inch rock banging it on a tree just out of sight. Within fifty feet of me. Once again, I looked for it, but found no sign, but for no real reason, I was scared even with a .45 cal handgun in my hand. Decided to report this after reading other accounts from pierce county similar to mine.",

Just what it was I don't know but I know it was not very far away from me. I couldn't see what it was or exactly where it was. I live in Alturas, Ca. I have no idea exactly what I'm supposed to put in this report but I've not heard this \"howl\" again. When I heard this, I was going down to close my gate. My dog (pit bull) came with me as always but stopped about half way down the hill. I called him but when we heard this \"howl\" for the second time he turned and ran to the house and when I got back up the hill, he was as far back in his dog house as he could get. This is strange for him as he thinks he is the worst thing in the community and really not afraid of anything. I don't know what else to tell you except it was really an eery kind of howl and not anything like I've ever heard before. We have a lot of dogs in this part of Modoc Estates and at that particular time, not even one was barking like usual.",
