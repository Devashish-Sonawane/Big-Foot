We kept finding peices of wood around some foot prints.  Then I heard another noise and when I looked over my shoulder there was a hairy ape-like being about 6'8\" no more than twenty yards away.  Our instincts were to run, so we did.  When we returned to my house my mom did not believe us.  That was my run in with big foot.",

            "Observed": "It was a warm June afternoon when my dog Sadie and I went for a walk back in the woods on our property. After we walked threw the woods on our property i decided to take the gravel road the mile or so back home instead of traveling threw the woods again. I got a half mile away from the house when i kept hearing something like a rock or a branch hitting against a tree. At first i thought it was just animals or my husband goofing off in the woods to scare me. When i reached where i thought the noise was coming from i stopped and was looking up into the woods, but i couldnt see anything, so i proceed to yell, ha ha very funny because like i said i thought it was my husband. Well the banging got louder then stopped completly. I got the feeling something was watching me so i told Sadie lets go girl and started to walk a little faster. Just then a fairly sized rock came whizzing out of the woods and just missed me. I stopped looked in the woods because i couldnt believe what just happend, but i still couldnt see anything. So, i really started to pick up the pace just then another rock came flying out of the woods and just missed me. By the time all this happend i was at the bend in the road and i looked up in the hollar where the last rock had come from when something i can not explain let out the awfulest low growl then scream i have ever heard. It scared me and Sadie so bad we took off running and i dont think i felt the ground under my feet i was running so fast. I told my husband about it when i got home and realized it was not him he had been there the whole time. A few days later he convinced me to take him back where it all happend and along side the road was a foot print that was fairly large but shaped different. I have not adventured back there since then and really dont care to.",
