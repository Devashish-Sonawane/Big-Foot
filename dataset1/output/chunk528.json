They live near a forest and hear animal sounds periodically. These sounds were so unusual that they prompted the action described in the account above. - This small complex of four apartments is surrounded on three sides by forest.- He refined his time estimate to be later at night, between 1 and 3 am.- The vocalization was a series of sounds as described above ranged from guttural growls, to chirps and whoops. He told me that at times they were all combined \u0096 and it was \u0093really loud.\u0094- It was emanating from just inside the tree line approx. 300 feet away.- The sound was so disturbing, he ran into to get his father for \u0093back-up\u0094 and they both inspected the perimeter of the dwellings.- After standing outside the neighbor's window, he estimated the height of the creature to be between 8 and 9 feet.",

They identified a bear track nearby and noted the difference.- They returned Sunday to observe and photograph the tracks. They followed the set of tracks for 20 yards.  One solitary large track was discovered some distance from the other tracks further up the road.- There were 3 sizes of tracks. One single, very large track in mud (larger than 13\u0094 long and 3\u0094 deep), a set of 13\u0094 tracks, approx. 1\u0094 deep in the mud along the dirt road and a set of 8\u0094 long tracks. - They also found old tracks off the road that wandered up the hill another 30 yards.- A friend saw one cross Hwy. 162 early one morning just outside of town as he was driving to work in Willits, CA.- There are many stories extending over several generations on this reservation. The Native American tribes that share the Round Valley Indian Reservation are: the Nomlaki, the Wailaki, the Pomo, the Pit River and the Concow.",
