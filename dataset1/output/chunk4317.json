            "Media Issue": "Orchard said he decided to write the first book after local U.S. Forest Service employee Paul Freeman reported running into an eight-foot Bigfoot while on patrol in the Mill Creek watershed.  Freeman took a lot of criticism for reporting his experience, eventually losing his job and moving his family out of the area. \u0093I guess I\u0092d say I was in Paul Freeman\u0092s corner to some extent,\u0094 Orchard said. \u0093I thought I\u0092d like to present the facts I had, even if they were anecdotal.  It hadn\u0092t been done before.\u0094 The books contain many of the columns Orchard has written on area Bigfoot sightings and evidence in the Union-Bulletin and for the Waitsburg Times.  His second book strives to update the experiences of local outdoorsmen and women, as will as chronicle some scientific viewpoints on the subject. \u0093Science has ignored it or done little with it,\u0094 Orchard said. \u0093Right here in the Blue Mountains is one of the best, if not the best place, to research (Bigfoot).\u0094 And Orchard certainly isn\u0092t alone in his local patronage of the Bigfoot enthusiasts used to meet every Wednesday morning at the Blue Mountain Mall food court to discuss their experiences and developments.",
