Then the can of fish came rolling down the hill past my tent. Thinking it was a bear I loaded my .22 rifle and shot up to scare it off. Then this huge creature ran off through the swamp. From the noise it was making one can assume it was big, whatever it was. So we got out of our tents, built a fire, disposed of the fish and talked about it for 20 min. or so. Shortly after we went back into our tents loud screams came from the other side of the lake.",

Mile marker 1 i just came from and before i get to 2 I park my car up on hill there, so I come down to the trail run over the bridege to mile marker 1, turn around and then run all the way to mile marker 3, then back to my car, so 6 miles. Anyway i was heading to the 2 mile mark (or kilometer mark, can't recall) and i was coming around the bend and i can see more than a half, maybe 2 thirds mile down the path, not sure, and i see a big guy weasring a coat. walking in the way i'm running. As i got closer It looked furry and i thought why would someone be wearing a coat it's 65 degrees or more out! As i jogged closer, the thing got bigger (it had it's back toward me) and I stopped, got the chivvers and thought...that is a bigfoot...then the thing went around the bend ahead where there's a small stream and retention pond. It was still daylight and i kept running thinking it couldn't have been...but i ran another mile and there was no one there...where did it go? On the way back i stopped at a whole in a fence by a stream and small pond and lookeed in there. it was pitch black and then i got the chills and thought that thing might be in there...i went back to my car and have not run on that trail since! Finding Bigfoot show reminded me of this.",
