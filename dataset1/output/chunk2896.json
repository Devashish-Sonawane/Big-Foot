Subsequently the actual witness of the Sasquatch granted an interview and as a result, upgraded the report to a class \"A\" sighting. The witness was driving East, along US Highway 33 in a very remote portion of West Virginia. It was near midnight with a little moonlight visible.  The sighting lasted approximately 4 seconds and was described as follows:The creature was walking hunched over in the opposite direction they were driving. He could see its face but did not notice any eye shine reflecting from his headlights. The hair was colored somewhat like the bark of a tree, greenish/gray. It was proportioned like a human except for a much thicker body, neck, and head.  He stated the creature did not display any reaction to the two vehicles passing it that night.  The remining details match those expressed in the statement above. This is the third of three sightings within 10 miles of Seneca Rocks in 2007.",

I was 12 years old at the time. The property contained 236 acres of undeveloped land. My father had completed our driveway and was sitting on the porch in the evening when he heard what he thought was me walking around the corner of the house in the freshly laid gravel. Since I'm relaying this story to you, you've probably figured out it wasn't me but something else he was faced with, which quickly turned and ran away when it saw him, leaving behind a \"wild\", \"musty\", \"skunk-like\" smell. Which hung around about 30 minutes (unlike a skunk [ed: odor], which hangs around for days). Over the next ten to twelve years we had other \"visits\". Sometimes two or three in the same summer, and then we would maybe go two years without one. They ranged from footprints, to \"screams\", to smells.",
