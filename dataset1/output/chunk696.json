            "Follow-Up Report": "On 8/8/2020 investigator Bill Hanna and I visited the home of witness Howard Mace and met with him, and his wife, Ellen. We found them to be credible witnesses.Their property parallels a railroad track, and endless acres of forest, rolling up a gradual hillside. They have heard whistles, whoops, howls, knocks, tree breaks, and grunting noises from the woods beyond the tracks. Ellen said that when she was picking herbs from her garden, she sensed being watched, from above. When their grandkids visit and play in the backyard, they hear whoops and knocks from the woods.Howard is a coon hunter and has seen large footprints in the woods. One time he had a coon dog taken from him in those same woods, assumed killed, never found.Their daughter Julie saw a 8.5'(est.) tall dark hairy creature, outside her window, looking in at her.( I measured the window, and it was 2' taller than Howard and me, and we are both over 6' tall). She saw amber colored eyes.They smelled a \"dead garbage smell\" coming from their woods, on numerous occasions. A Mexican family, neighbors, was preparing food outdoors at Christmas, 2019, and reported seeing a creature in the woods watching them.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness on 7/31/06.  The following details can be added to the report:-The incidents detailed below happened when the reporting witness was around 21 years old.-Besides the reporting witness, there were three other young men on this trip.-The incidents happened on the witness\u0092 third camping trip to the area.-After camping at this location for a couple nights, the witness went to a snowdrift (\u0093glacier\u0094) directly above the camp.  He was startled to find two sets of large footprints in the snow where the day before there were none.  -One was approximately 15 inches long and 9 inches wide, and the other was about 12 inches long and 10 inches wide.  -The first prints at the bottom of the snowdrift were the only clear ones.  The toes were plainly visible, with the first digit (the \u0093big toe\u0094) being most deeply impressed.  -The prints above the first were much messier.  The witness says that the prints were impressed sideways into the snowdrift, and that whatever made them stepped into its own prints as it ascended the slope. -The two trackways were spaced about 8 feet apart.-The young men followed the trackways to the top of a cliff.  There was an old military helicopter crash site at the top of the ridge.  The nearby marine base was very active at this time, and there are many such crash sites out in the Sierras, according to forestry service workers interviewed regarding this report.-Near the helicopter crash site, there was a thickly wooded canyon.  The young men would not enter it due to the overpowering smell that came out of it.  The smell was described as being like a dirty cage at the zoo (the witness specifically compared it to the lemur cage at the Sacramento Zoo).  The witness described it as making his eyes water.-There were large boulders precariously balanced along the edge of the cliff.  The young men took great pleasure in pushing them off the cliff and listening to the sound of the boulders crashing through the underbrush below.  The number of rocks was such that it took as long as 15 minutes to push all of them off the edge.  Most of the rocks were the size of soccer balls, but many were as large as \u0093large beach balls.\u0094  The rocks were said to be large enough to be difficult to move, yet purposefully placed.-That night, the young men were awakened by the sounds of \u0093a big man\u0094 walking through their camp.  The witness did not think it was a bear because it sounded bipedal. Their two tents were situated door to door, with only a few feet between the openings.  The men excitedly whispered about how scary it was for a few moments, at which time the walking stopped.  After they stopped talking and started falling back asleep, the walking started again, apparently from very nearby the camp.  It seemed as though the visitor was waiting for things to quiet down before lurking around again.  The witness is positive that there were no humans camping nearby. -Two or three days later, while fishing at nearby Roosevelt Lake, a very loud howl occurred from a forested area above their fishing spot.  It was similar to the \"Ohio Howl,\" and the witness was very impressed with the volume of the call.  The howl happened at approximately 3 pm.  Several of the young men momentarily \u0093ran in panic\u0094 at the sound, including the witness.  It was obvious the witness was very frightened by this.  ",
