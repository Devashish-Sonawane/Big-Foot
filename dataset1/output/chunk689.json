            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the main witness by phone. He was hesitant to report this due to fear of ridicule. He and his two good friends, all between the ages of 21 and 24, were spending the night in a small trailer on some property his Uncle owned just outside of Naples. At around 8:00pm, they built a fire and cooked some fish and meat. Afterwards, they were just starting to relax and have a cigarette, when they heard an unusual animal noise off in the distance. He says it was like a strange mix between a howl, and a scream of agony. After this animal made a few more of these noises, the boys, figuring it was someone playing a prank, began to make noises back of their own. The witness said he began to  hooo hooo,  like a monkey and that made this thing really pick up the pace. Soon the boys could hear more noises coming from a different direction. The witness says thy were filled with adrenalin and headed to get the Uncle who lived on the other end of the property. But the Uncle said it was probably just someone playing with them. The boys then walked to the end of the road which stops at the wood line, directly across from where the noises were coming from, and began to make more howling noises to see if it was still in the area. The witness said they could hear something big moving in the brush just 30 feet away. It was breaking branches and stomping its feet.  They then began to throw rocks and sticks in the general direction. Soon, there was bigger rocks coming in towards them, but these were coming in quite close. As if they were intended to hit the boys. This turned into loud growling/grunting and they could hear small trees being snapped and ripped from the ground. At this point, the boys fear overcame their curiosity, and they quickly headed for the safety of the small trailer. All three squeezed into the bedroom at the far end. The witness said they could hear it screaming just outside the trailer, and soon they could hear it walking, and  brushing against the side of the trailer. For an hour the witness says, they argued as to who should look out the window to see what it was. Finally, the main witness says he relented, gently crawled across the bed, and lifted one of the small horizontal  blinds. They all agreed since they had no lights on, they should be able to see out without anything seeing in. When he peeked out between two blinds, he says he was relieved to see only his reflection, and when he tilted his head, the reflection tilted too. He then dropped the blind and when his friends asked what he saw, he said nothing,  just his reflection (just his eyes). One of the boys said that shouldn't be, as there is no light to cause this. So the witness looks out again, and this time has a clear view of the trees and bushes just outside the window. He says the horror of what he actually saw hit him so hard, he began to cry. They all huddled together and fell in and out of sleep, until the morning when his cousin drove up. The witness was adamant this thing could have hurt them if it wanted to, but didn't. The window sits over 7 ft from the ground, so this animal was between 7-8 ft tall. Naples is a very active area and abutts the Florida Everglades, a 734 square mile expanse of grass and water that harbors thousands of species of animals. The Seminole and Miccosukee Indians have lived here for many years, and have their own stories of encounters with the \"hairy men\".",
