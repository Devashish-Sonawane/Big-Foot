            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.  He is a former Marine and former law enforcement.  He is a skeptic of sasquatches.  From his background in law enforcement he \u0093wants to see hard evidence\u0094.  His wife believes that squatches are real and enjoys squatching.  So on the night in question, he, his wife, and their son were out squatching in a heavily wooded area.  They stopped their truck on the road.  There was a slight crescent moon out that night.  Not long after putting the truck in park they heard an \u0093ape like\u0094 sound from his 9:30 to 10:00 o\u0092clock area.   He estimated that the sound came from about 15 yards inside the tree line area. I asked him if he had heard the sound before.  His response was \u0093yes, at the zoo, in the chimpanzee and ape areas\u0094. He said it sort of sounded like a whoop but at the end it went up in pitch.  I asked if he had heard that sound in the forest before.  He said he had not, only at the zoo.They put the truck in reverse and backed up maybe around 20 feet and put it back in park.  Then they heard a second sound.  This sound was from his 7:00 o\u0092clock direction.  It was the same type of vocalization, but the sound was different.  It was deeper and more aggressive.  He absolutely believes the second noise was from a second creature.  After some discussion, he agreed that he felt that the first noise was more of an alert or maybe curious.  The second noise felt much more like a \u0093you need to leave\u0094 type of warning.After the second noise, all three of them got out of the truck, set up some lawn chairs and fired up a lantern.  He looked around a bit and shined a light in the direction of both noises, but did not go into the woods.  They did not hear any subsequent noises.  ",
