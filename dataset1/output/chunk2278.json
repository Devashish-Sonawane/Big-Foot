However, the detailed description by the witness and his background would lead one to believe that these indeed were very possible whoops from sasquatches. The area is prime habitat for these animals to live and thrive.Buffalo National River Wilderness is divided into three sections. The Lower Buffalo Unit is the largest, stretching from Buffalo Point Ranger Station to the town of Buffalo City on the White River, a distance of 32 miles. Here the water runs smooth and has few human visitors. The Lower Buffalo Unit adjoins Leatherwood Wilderness (managed by Ozark National Forest). Several trails provide access from the river into the Wilderness areas. ",
