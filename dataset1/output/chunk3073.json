            "Observed": "I am a truck driver for an over the road company, and I used to drive from IH35 in Texas, across to IH49 in Louisiana by way of TX84. The part of East Texas I ws driving in is very dense forrest, and is largly covered by brush. I was coming out of Mount Enterprise approx. 1 to 2 miles, there were no houses or cars anywhere in site. I saw a black fiqure on the side of the road that looked likea a large animal rolling on the ground like it was trying to scratch its self, it was night time (11:30 PM) but you could see well in the dark with the high beams and running lites on my rig. As I got closer it stood on its hind legs and started to walkng towards me on the left side of the road (walking from East to West). It appeared to be approx. 6 1/2 to 7 foot tall, I am really not sure of the height because i was driving at 60 MPH but I could tell it was very broad, and with the headlights in its eyes they appeared to be sort of reflecting the lite, like a possum or coyote or other wild animals would do at night. It was completely covered with hair, sort of a redish black looking color from what I could make out. it had a flat looking forhead and a flat looking nose and his mouth was hard to make out. When I drove past, it was jumping up and down on the side of the road, sort of hitting its chest like an ape. It never tried to run off in the woods like I heard they do when they see you. But I have thought about that and fiqured it may have been looking at all the lights on my trucka nd trailer. I drove for several hrs. after that and did not pass a dozen cars on the road. I went over in my head all night long trying to convience myself it was someone playing a joke in an ape suit, but they would have had to be widest person I have ever seen, with long arms. (almost th there knees) but to tell the truth I just dont know. I have not drove down that way since the occurance, and I dont care to. That would be the last place I would ever want to break down.",
