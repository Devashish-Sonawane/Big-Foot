During this time several drain pipes around our home were knocked down and what ever did this left many large, human-like footprints. These prints were seen by myself, brother, Mother and Father. My father, after the screaming ended, went outside and destroyed the prints. To this day, we believe that this was to keep us from being frightened. At this time I had read several books on the Bigfoot/Sasquatch mystery and was familure with the creature. My mother, to this day will not talk about the incident. I strongly believe that this was a Sasquatch passing through our area. These sounds contiunued for several days and then stopped.",

My uncle is a construction worker who goes to work real early and on two occasions he observed a creature like the one I saw as he drove down a road close to the road that I was on. The creature crossed to the same canal that I was near. The second time my uncle saw the creature he stopped his truck and grabbed his pistol and a light and tried to follow the creature through the orchards that line the roads. He said he couldn\u2019t catch up to it but he saw lots of displaced grass where it had passed. My uncle turned back after following it for about 100 yards as it was dark and he was alone.",
