I thought it would be funny to see what sightings have happend around my home city of Yakima Washington.  When I clicked on the report form of the July 2000 (class B) hearing sound around bumping lake, I got the chills.  Let me start from the begining.  Myself and a couple of buddies of mine took off from Yakima really late with the intent of climbing the trail and spending 3 days of camping at Twin Sisters. We were going to stay at the first lake (Or First Sister).  The lake is about 8 or 9 miles past bumping lake and you have to hike in about 1-1.25 miles straight up.",

It had a low guttural beginning, then gained in volume to an all out yell / scream.  It had angry, menacing tones that the witness stated he will not forget.  The third night the rock-throwing incident was unusual since only individual rocks were heard bouncing down the hillside.  One would expect a rockslide to have multiple rocks associated with it and raise quite a disturbance.  They heard the sound of only single rocks striking other rocks, in different places along the mountainside above them.Daytime temps were in the mid to high 70\u0092s, Nighttime temps were in the low 40\u0092s.  The moon was in full phase on this date.Yakima County has a history of compelling reports, which continue to this day.",
