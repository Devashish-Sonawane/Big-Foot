            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and a friend were in a canoe fishing when they saw a dark object approximately 50 yards away along the north, northwest shoreline of Pine Pond, .  They thought it was a bear and started to row towards it.  When they had closed the distance to about 40 feet the creature stood up.  They immediately realized it was not a bear, stopped rowing and paddled backwards.  They observed it for about 25 seconds.  However, details of the creature\u0092s appearance were rather vague because it was standing in the shadows and light levels were low at that time of day.The report states is was about seven feet tall, but, in retrospect the witness believes it was a little less than that.  It was very similar in size and moved in a fashion similar to the creature seen in the Patterson film.The witness is not sure what was making the noise behind the creature.  It did not seem alarmed by the noise. But, rather, seemed to know what it was and it was at this point it turned and left.Pine Pond is about 10 miles from Lake Placid host of the 1932 and 1980 winter olympic games.",
