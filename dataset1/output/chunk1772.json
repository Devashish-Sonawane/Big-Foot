            "Follow-Up Report": "The submitter of the report said that his wife has no idea how long she stared at the creature, but that it seemed like it was quite a few minutes. He said that it was squatting and then ran. He said that even when it ran it was squatted down, making it appear only three or four feet high, though he could tell it was actually taller than that. He estimated it to be anywhere from five to eight feet tall. The submitter also said that the creature had Blackish-brown hair about six inches long, but added that for him the thing looked like a quick black blur. He said he's a hunter and has seen elk and other animals, and that this was faster than anything else he's ever seen. He said there's a thick grove of oak there and that above them was another flat, with yet another flat above that. He said the creature ran up the mountain \u0096 headed for the oaks.After talking to the submitter of the report I was also able to talk to his wife. She talked about being too freaked-out to move or say anything. She said the creature had a total human shape, but covered with hair, and she said it looked more human than the bigfoots she's seen on TV \u0096 with the ones on TV looking more ape-like. She added that it was bigger than a man. The creature was a big dark spot in the fall colors.   The witness said she will not forget the experience. To me it seemed like she's really conflicted about the experience - not wanting to believe she saw what she saw, but that having no choice because she definitely saw it, and actually stared at it for quite some time. She said her kids laugh about her experience and other people make fun about it as well. I really think  more people would talk about their bigfoot experiences if other people didn't respond that way. Some of the physical characteristics reported by the witness are as follows: it had straight, dark brown hair all over the body, including on the ears, but shorter on the face than elsewhere. The nose was barely visible because of the hair. It had dark lips and you couldn't see the teeth. The head was shaped more like a human head than a gorilla's head. No neck was visible because of the long facial hair. When it moved it looked like it was hunched over, trying to run but stay hidden. It's legs looked different than a bear's legs, with what appeared to be feet rather than paws.The witness evidently did a sketch of what she saw but no longer knows where the sketch is. I feel this is a particularly valuable report because the primary witness was able to see the creature for such a long time and at such close range. I am convinced that both witnesses are credible and saw the things they reported seeing. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I visited at length with the witness, who is in his early 30's now, but was only nine at the time of this encounter.  I found him to be very intelligent, well-spoken, and with a thoughtful mind. This sighting made a vivid and lasting impression on him, even though he was so young at the time of the event.In addition to his written account, I can add the following details:As the boys were searching for firewood, they had crossed a fence line and entered a thicker portion of the woods.  The witness felt that they had left J's family's property.  It was while they were in these heavier woods that the dog began acting up.  It was also here that they found the trees that had been stripped of their bark to a great height. The witness estimated that the bark had been stripped off at least 8' up. A footprint was found under one of these trees, and at this point J felt that they needed to leave, and placed his knife in the ground as a marker near the footprint.The dog was very agitated at this time, and the witness felt that the dog was very aware of the animal's presence (although the boys did not see anything at this point).When the witness looked up from the pond bank and saw the creature standing approximately 100' from him, he immediately slid down the bank toward the water to try to conceal himself, while still keeping his line of sight open. He did have a BB gun, but quickly realized that shooting it at the creature would probably only anger it.   The creature stood behind a tobacco trailer, and it's upper torso was visible above the top of the trailer.  While many tobacco trailers are hand made and vary somewhat in construction, the height is usually around 5 1/2' to 6' tall at the top of the pipe rack that holds the tobacco plants. The witness was down over the pond bank at this point, and thus looking up at the creature, which lends strength to his estimate that the creature was of a great height.  Additionally, when J's father arrived and stood in the same place, the witness could tell that the creature had been much larger than the father, who was 6'9\".  I asked if the witness could determine gender, and although there was no visible genitalia, he 'felt' that this was a male. It stood erect on two legs, and by the witness' description was very 'gorilla-like' in appearance. When I asked him to expound on why he felt it was 'gorilla-like', he explained that the head shape was very similar to that of a gorilla - conical.  He further noted that the nose was large and flat, the eyes were black, and there was a very defined brow line.  I feel confident that this young man had a legitimate Class A sighting. At the time of this encounter, the area around Portland was a mixture of farmland interspersed with heavy forest, a good deer population, and plenty of fresh running water.",
