It was late at night, about 1:00 a.m. I don't remember the exact date but it was late May. I'm not from this area and my wife's relatives had told me about sightings in the past. I wasn't convinced. However, on this night my attitude changed. My wife, of course, was asleep so I'm the only one that saw it. We were about five miles outside of Watson on Hwy. 1  when suddenly I saw a tremendous blur of white about 30 yards in front of the car. It was a large animal or man at least 7 feet tall tearing across the road. I yelled at my wife, \"did you see that?!\". Of course, she did not. But I believe what I saw to be a bigfoot or sasquatch.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness during a telephone interview and the following can be added to this report:Witness stated the animal passed from the woodline at the left side of the road across into the woodline on the right side of the road.  He stated it was very fast and moving upright on two legs.  He stated at the time there was no other traffic, he was the driver of the vehicle and his high beams were on illuminating the animal.  The animal never looked to the left or right, but moved swiftly across the road into the trees.  Witness states he remembers this event vividly and could take an investigator to the exact area the animal crossed.  The witness related he had grown up in NW Arkansas and that years earlier, his grandmother had recounted a sighting that she had of an animal staring into her kitchen window above her sink.  The witness stated as a youth growing up in NW AR he had heard vocalizations that he could not categorize as a known species to the area, but had never had a sighting until the Spring of 2001 when the white animal crossed in front of his car.  He stated before this incident, he was not a believer in sasquatch, but knows that what he saw cross the highway in front of him was very large approximately 7' in height and was running upright.",
