            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness via phone. Quite familiar with the area, as it is 30 miles or less from my home. He is an avid birdwatcher. He is also a hunter and has hunted bear and all North American game. He is an avid observer of all game, and has seen most, live and in the wild. He insisted his was NOT a bear, nor a person in a suit. He has been going to this same area since 1965, as a kid, and he knows it better than the rangers. The binoculars he was using were Bushnell, 10 X 50, 5.7 in FOV, and 300 meters to 1000 meters. He saw the creature \"looking for something in the woods\". It was walking along the tree line, sometimes leaning in, looking, then would walk a few more steps and repeat the process. It was walking \"in a straight line, a line like the police would ask you to walk if doing a sobriety test\". One foot in front of the other, very long arms\" longer than humans by quite a bit\". There was \"arm swing\" though it was not \"exaggerated\", as it was a slow unhurried walk. The creature did not see him. As he watched the creature for a few minutes, he reached for his spotting scope, but the creature had disappeared into the woods by the time he found it. It was as described very large, at least 7 ft tall, brown and hairy, not fur. He did not see any great detail because the sun was directly behind the creature, shining through the woods and creating a \"back lit\" effect, with an occasional clear view of the side and back only, so there was no detail of the face or musculature. This would be one of my better observational witnesses, as he is a trained observer of nature since 1965. He knows what he saw and he knows what he DIDN\"T see. He was succinct and to the point. It was what it was.The lake is stocked and the fishermen often catch carp, which are tossed on the bank or back in the woods. They are undesirable for eating and the carp eat some of the fish the people are actually trying to catch for sport and food. I saw several carcasses while we walked around. ",

            "Observed": "This happened around August/September of 1973 time frame.  My friend and I were walking down some railroad tracks near the Ohio river.  We were walking from East Liverpool to Wellsville Ohio, just below Route 7.  When we started out our walk, the sun was just about ready to set.  I would say it was about 7:30 or 8:00 o'clock in the evening.  When we got about 1/2 mile into it, we heard this noise, (sounded like some brush being stompped down), on the side of the hill and we looked up.  There stood this enormous hairy figure looking down at us from about 25 yards away.  He was leaning out from behind this tree and his arm was wrapped around it.  It was very tall, with big arms.  I ran as fast as I could as well did my friend, back the other way.  I told my parents about this and all they did is laugh at me and told me that there is no such thing.  I'm 48 years old now and I still know what my friend and I saw.  I believe in Bigfoot and believe that they are descendants of cavemen that have never evolved.",
