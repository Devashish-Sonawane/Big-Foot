            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness in person and took his report.  He said that he had hunted this same area many times in the past, but this is the first time he had ever had anything like this happen.  I went to the area with him, but the timber has been cut all along the bottom where his encounter occurred.  We walked down the road he was on that day, but could only go a short distance due to the tops that the timber cutters left on the road.  The bayou that  this area borders goes for miles, and flows all the way into Louisiana.I've known this person for years and he is the type of person who is not easily scared by anything.  He is very much an outdoors person who spends a great amount of time year around in the woods.  When I questioned him about the creature, he said that he estimated the height at 6.5 feet tall, maybe a little taller, and said the hair was reddish brown in color and looked like it was 3 to 4 inches long, except for the face which looked bare.  He said the arms looked long, and that they were swinging, not held like a runner would hold his arms.  He only saw the creature from the side and it did not turn its head to look at him as it crossed the road behind him, that he could tell.  He said that as far as he could tell in the seconds he saw it, he could not see any ears or specific facial features.  After it crossed behind him, he heard what sounded like  running away from the road through the brush, and that's when he took off for the truck.",

            "Observed": "During an elk hunt Aug.28th to Sept. 4th we were camped in the Snow Mass Wilderness area. The first two days were normal with no activity. We were just glassing for elk and fishing. After the first day of elk season my friend Jim shot his elk and that night things started to happen. That night we put some loins on an old saddle rack ( about 4' high) for lunch the next day. The next morning they were gone with no trace of anything climbing or dragging them away. The rack would not of held up to anything of weight climbing on it. It was like something had picked them up and walked away.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "The names of the witnesses have been changed in order to protect their identities as requested by them.Spoke to the witness John on the phone and can add the following. The first day at camp they noted an unusual skunky odor in the area.  Several comments were made by other hunters in the camp of \"things with long hair\" brushing up against their tents during the night. The camp had many items including fishing poles and supplies lying around, and nothing was disturbed the entire time with the exception of the missing elk loins.On the third night a member of the hunting party experienced something pushing hard on his feet through the tent wall in the middle of the night. The fourth night in camp the witness was in his tent asleep when he was awakened with the sensation of movement and then realized his tent was slowly moving.He quickly reacted by rolling over and grabbing his flashlight, but then the movement stopped. He never turned it on. Later after thinking about the event he said he thought that when he rolled over his movement was felt by the culprit and that is why it stopped. He lay awake in his tent listening unable to sleep  until morning and then went out to inspect his tent and confirm if what he had experienced had really happened.He saw that his tent had been moved approximately six to eight inches in an outward direction away from the camp center.     The ground was level in the area.The tent never collapsed during this event, and while assessing the situation that following morning John had found no tears, teeth marks or any other type of damage to the tent material that someone would expect to find if a bear or other powerful large animal would have likely left on the tent material. All the stakes he had used to stake the tent into the ground were pulled up and out in the same direction as the tent movement. The tent is a high quality Cabellas XPG Deluxe two person tent, which includes stakes six inches long and made of T6 extruded aluminum. He also noted that immediately after the dragging had stopped, he laid still and listened but never heard anything leave the proximity of the tent, neither footsteps or breathing. John was very perplexed as to this event. The ground was dry and fairly compact at the location. Knowing the tent had been staked into the ground using all six loops, he felt that whatever had moved his tent had to have a great amount of power in order to pull the stakes out as it did. He emphasized that he never felt a pause when the stakes caught the loops, instead the pulling action was steady and strong the entire time giving him the impression that whatever had pulled it was extremely powerful and agile since it did not tear any material in the process. This really bothered him. Below is some additional information that was emailed to me from John after the initial interview and after asking him to include any other details he could remember... \u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096DennisAfter reading some of the reports there is a few things that I think are related to my report. One is someone talking about some scat that looked somewhat like horse, and that was something I forgot to put in my report. I found some scat above our camp that puzzled me I have hunted bear and many other big game animals in Canada but the scat I found looked more human like but was in segments @ 4\" long. I took it for bear but it was more colored like human and did not have berries or other thing in it like a bear, also bear scat is usually in piles and this was scattered like it was walking as it was going. It was not Elk or Deer or Cat it was something I have not seen before. The other hunters saw it and did not know what it was either but I told them it was bear even though I knew it wasn't. The two guys with me think there is no way there is such a thing as bigfoot so I didn't want to look like I was crazy. We found the scat on the trail we dragged the elk out on the day before.I'm not sure if I put in the report about the tops of trees that were broken in that area but I could stand at the bottom of the pine tree and I could just reach the bottom of the broken tops and I am 5'11\". The tops were broken like someone would reach up and break the top over and you could tell it was done by something with soft hands because the tree was not scared above or below the break like an Elk would do and you could see the branches above the break was squeezed down like a hand would do.Also that same day I could hear rocks above me like they being thrown down the rock ledge above and at that time I thought it might be Elk above but I could not see anything. I want you to know I did not go out there thinking I would run into a Bigfoot but all the things that happened really bothers me because my mind tells me that it was all something else but my heart tells me it had to be. Thanks \u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096\u0096John adds the whoops they heard and described where like the 1974 sierra sounds \u0093whoops without the knocks.\"   http://www.bfro.net/avevid/SierraSounds/Whoop.mp3They cut the trip short by one day due to these events, they were all uneasy and wanted to leave. I phoned Johns friend and hunting partner Jim shortly after speaking with John. He confirmed the events to me as John described, and said that he trusted John\u0092s observations, and that he was not the kind of person to make extraordinary claims unless it happened.  John also commented on how dark at night the location was. \"You could not even see your hand in front of your face ,so how can whatever these things are, see so well in a very cluttered campsite in such dark conditions?\" he said.",
