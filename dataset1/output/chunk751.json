            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness regarding his experience and can add the following details to this report:The area on Interstate 59/20 where the animal crossed the road was in an open area with a median and not a lot of trees. The witness told me there were lots of \u0093rolling hills\u0094 in the area.The witness stated it was raining very hard at the time of the incident - a hard, steady rain, rather than precipitation associated with thunderstorm activity. I asked if there was any lightning that night and the witness stated he did not observe lightning before or after the encounter.From what he saw of the animal, it was completely covered in hair. He said the hair was brown in color and a fairly uniform 3 to 4 inches in length. The animal appeared \u0093ape-like,\u0094 except the witness wasn\u0092t able to discern any of its facial features. The witness stated it was almost as if the animal \u0093didn\u0092t have a face.\u0094 I asked if he could see its eyes and he emphasized that he was unable to discern any facial features. However, he was positive the animal\u0092s hair was brown in color, despite the fact the entire encounter only lasted 3 to 5 seconds. The witness added the hair almost had a \u0093shiny\u0094 appearance because it was wet.At the closest point of the encounter the animal was within 3 feet of his car and the witness had to slow down and swerve to the right to avoid hitting it. The animal crossed from his left to right (it came from the west side of Interstate 59/20 and was traveling towards the East). The witness stated in his report that it was \"running towards us,\" but when I spoke with him he said it appeared to be walking rather than running as it crossed the interstate. He said the animal never tried to stop and he thinks it never saw his jeep or even realized he was there until just before the witness nearly hit it. Even though the witness nearly hit the animal, it continued crossing the road and never slowed down or stopped.I am very familiar with the area of Interstate 59/20 where this incident occurred. The area is fairly remote and there are large areas of thick piney woods, with patchy areas that have been clear cut and occasional fields. There are also quite a few rolling hills in this area. It would be possible for an animal to cross the road in the manner the witness described and neither see nor be seen by people in a car, until just prior to impact. This is especially true if there was heavy rain as the witness experienced the night of his encounter.Please note there are two other reported sightings in Lauderdale County, which is next to Clarke County where this incident occurred.
