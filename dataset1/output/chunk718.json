            "Observed": "I was 18 years old, living in Chiefland, Florida. I just graduated from high school (1981), class valedictorian, and  had begun my freshman year at the University of Florida in Gainesville. It was around 7:30 am with a fair amount of light. Fall was just rolling in and the air was beginning to cool. It was a clear morning at the end of August and I was on my way to my first class, The drive from my parent\u0092s home to school took me through heavily wooded, sparsely populated areas of north central Florida. I was on highway 27 between Bronson and Chiefland, coming around a big bend in the road.  The trees had been clear cut from the edge of the road for about 100 yards on either side. As I followed the curve, a movement on my left caught my eye. Someone was walking out of the tree line and towards the road. I slowed and pulled over, finally stopping my car as I tried to frame what I was seeing in terms I could understand, The \u0093person\u0094 walking from the woods was huge, well over 7 feet tall. I kept wondering what a tall, naked, hairy \u0093man\u0094 was doing out in the woods at that time (or any time) of the day. I never had the thought \u0093skunk ape\u0094 or \u0093Bigfoot\u0094\u0085I truly wanted to find a rational explanation for the creature that crossed the road (in just a couple of steps) and continued, unhurried, towards the line of trees on the other side. As I sat in my car staring at the creature, it turned to look at me, moving the upper torso to do so. I felt like we regarded each other for quite some time and, as stunned as I was, I was not prepared for what happened next. The creature reached down and swung a \u0093juvenile\u0094 up onto her hip and disappeared into the trees, clearing a small barbed wire fence in one step.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to PJ over the phone and she was able to share these details--In late August, or early September, at around 730-800am, PJ was driving east on US 27 from Chiefland towards Bronson. While coming around a bend in the road she noticed movement on the left side of the road. Noticing a large bi-pedal figure, PJ slowed down and saw, what she thought at the time, an unusually tall, dark and muscular man. However, immediately realizing that it wasn\u0092t a man, PJ pulled onto the side of the road and, from about 40 feet away, observed that the figure was covered in hair and watched as it crossed the two-lane highway in just two steps. -She described the creature as being about seven-foot tall and that it was evenly covered with dark brown hair that had lighter colored highlights in the sunlight. She could not estimate a weight. It walked with a long, easy, fluid stride that did not appear hurried. Because of the distance she could not make out any distinct facial features except that the hair was lighter colored around the eyes and mouth. She stated that she could make out arms and they seemed to be unencumbered at the time of the crossing. She could not make out any neck, and that its head appeared rounded. The over-all frame of the creature\u0092s body was enormously muscular and dense with very broad shoulders. She related to me that while growing up, she had known several professional wrestlers and that, compared to them, this creature\u0092s size and stature was much greater. The hair covering the body was flowing and appeared to be well groomed and kept. In her opinion, the over-all state of the creature\u0092s physical appearance was healthy. -Once the creature crossed the road it approached a barbed-wire fence near the wood line. It stopped before the fence and turned towards PJ, rotating its upper body when it turned, and regarded her for a few moments. It then reached down, and at this point, PJ saw an arm come up from the weeds. Using its left arm, the creature hefted a smaller, hair-covered creature up from the ground and swung it over against its right hip. -When I asked PJ if she could identify the gender of the creature that had picked up the smaller creature, PJ admitted that she was not sure. She told me that she assumed the creature must have been a female since it was obviously picking up a young adolescent. The creature did not appear to PJ as being concerned, threatened or hurried during any part of the encounter. It merely watched PJ as it picked up the youth.-PJ admitted that it was hard to make out any details of the youth since it was pressed against the larger one\u0092s body. She did recall that it had a rounded head and looked about the same size as a four to five year old human child. The color of its hair was of a lighter color than the adult and appeared to PJ as looking more like fur than hair. She also recalled that its limbs appeared gangly and it wrapped its legs tightly around the adult\u0092s waist.-After securing the youth securely onto its right hip, the creature stepped over the barbed-wire fence and calmly walked into the woods.-During the entire encounter, PJ\u0092s car was running and the windows were closed. She did not recall any unusual odors or sounds.-PJ stated that during her whole encounter she did not feel frightened or threatened. She described her initial reaction to the adult creature as incredulity. She recalled hearing about \u0091Skunk Apes\u0092 as a child, but told me that she never thought she would ever encounter one. When she saw the creatures, she told me that the last thing on her mind was that they might be a \u0091Skunk Apes\u0092. Her later reaction to the sighting was a feeling that she had been a witness to something profound. She told me\u0085 \u0091We are missing something extraordinary. But I also feel that it (the creature she witnessed) is better off left alone, to go on and live it\u0092s own life\u0092. -In the early 1980\u0092s, the route between Chiefland and Bronson on Hwy 27 was composed mainly of rural farmsteads that were dispersed between vast tracts of forests, swamps and river bottomlands. The area the sighting took place in was between two clear-cut sections of land that extended about 100 yards on either side of the road with an overgrowth of weeds near the fence. Beyond these sections laid heavy forests with a bottom layer of thick scrub that was divided by a barbed-wire fence from the cut sections. The area is close to the Waccasassa River, which is now a conservation area, as well as several Suwannee River inlets that are still generally inaccessible. The similar report she referenced is Report #1407.",
