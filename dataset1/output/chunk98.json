He described them as \"high-pitched, animalistic yells\". Both he and his fianc\u00e9 described getting an \"eerie feeling\", but it did not deter them from fishing later that night/morning.As they went fishing on the river, they heard what sounded like a female voice speaking in the dense foliage ahead of them. Though he said it did not sound quite human, the witness still asked his fianc\u00e9 if she had said something, but she mentioned that she thought it was him. As far as they knew, they were the only ones in the area. The location the mumbling was coming from was so thick with vegetation that the witness could not see what was making the sound, nor did he think a person could get back there without a great deal of struggle.After the event took place, a friend of the witness described an incident in the same area where he saw an unidentified animal, approximately seven feet tall, that followed him back to his vehicle at night.",
