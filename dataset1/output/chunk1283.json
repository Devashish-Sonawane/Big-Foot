The animal was actually in view for about 3 to 4 seconds.- the animal had a different, lighter coloration around its face.- it walked bipedally, with slightly bent knees. It walked smoothly and quickly.- the witness believes the animal knew he was there and was not threatened by him.- it clearly was not a human or a bear. It was more slight than the animal in the famed Patterson film, perhaps weighing 400 pounds. It had a human like nose.- during the period when the animal was behind him in the brush, unseen, and the witness was hearing footsteps and breathing, two or three other people walked by. While these people were walking by the breathing and stepping sounds momentarily ceased.",
