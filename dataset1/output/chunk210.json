            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness, KLP, called me on the afternoon of August 8, 2009, and we went over what was heard in those early morning hours when those scary howling sounds were being heard by their family and others who lived close by. I ask the witness to go onto our web site and listen to the sound recordings. This witness stopped on the 1994 Ohio -Moaning Howl, and stated that is real close to what was heard, but much louder.I called the witness' mother, SKP, that same evening, so I could find out what she had heard. This witness also was awaken during those early morning hours to hear 3 very loud and distinct howls lasting 3 to 4 seconds for the first and last episodes, and about 1 to 2 seconds long on the middle howl; which had them up, and going outside to investigate what was making those sounds. When they went outside, they had the opportunity to see several coyotes and several raccoons scouring past their house, plus all of the dogs in the neighborhood were yelping, barking and raising heck. Also, outside were several of their neighbors who were already out with their flashlights and weapons in hand.Witness KLP stated that there are bears in their neighborhoods from time to time, reason is they do not have bear proof trash cans yet. This witness stated,  \"that those howling sounds came from something that we had never heard before, and they were blood curdling sounds, and way too loud to have been made by anything that normally lives in these mountains.\"",
