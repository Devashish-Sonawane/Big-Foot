            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke to both the husband and the wife. Both were witnesses and had the encounter with the alleged creature 2 years ago.Prior to seeing the green eyeshine, the chronological set of events included:Bipedal footstep sounds, sounds of rocks being thrown into the creek and a very loud moan/howl which was described as starting off with an owl sound, then moving towards a wailing woman/cat sound and ending with a very deep growl. The witness described the growl as very deep and stated \u0093I could feel it in my chest\u0094.Husband, who is ex Army and served 2 tours in Iraq portrays able marksman skills and is obviously very familiar with weapons. He explained that after several verbal attempts to ward off the alleged creature, he fired directly into it from about 30 yards away. He went on to further explain that once he did this, the eyes only moved closer to him. He said he felt threatened and called for a friend to come to his aid. Finally, the eyes moved back and then totally away from the couple once the friend arrived.Since this incident, he has heard screams/moans similar to these on other occasions in these woods both prior and since this encounter.I saw the area where this incident took place. It is very brushy at this point and slightly overgrown due to the season. The flat area where the couple witnessed this event is fairly small,  somewhat sandy with little grass and directly next to a small creek. Next to this area are small pockets of what appears to be flattened or \u0093carved out\u0094 underbrush. This may have been caused by wild hogs or recent flooding. The alleged creature stood across the creek and slightly uphill from where they were camping. No sounds related to what the witness encountered were heard that late evening of our visit.  Access is limited -- private property.  The property owner is concerned about trespassing, consequently the location will not be shown on the Google Earth layer.I appreciate the openness of both witnesses to discuss and point out these area as them to be very credible in their explanations. The witness continues to come to this area from time to time and future exploration may be possible. Should significant events occur an update will be posted with this report.",
