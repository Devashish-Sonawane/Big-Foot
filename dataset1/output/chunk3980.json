            "Follow-Up Report": "I was drawn to this report because I am familiar with the area as my grandmother once owned a cabin on nearby Houghton Lake and I still spend a great deal of time camping near Reedsburg Dam to the west and in the Au Sable State Forest to the east.  Further, the production of the Finding Bigfoot episode \u0093Bigfoot and Wolverines\u0094 was filmed, in part, not far from here at the Hartwick Pines State Park Lumbering Museum.  I was also interested because I reported on a similar incident that occurred in 2005 near the same general area.  Report #31121I was immediately taken with Mr. P\u0092s sincerity.  We had some commonalities to discuss regarding our mutual interest in deer hunting so it was easy to understand exactly what he was describing to me as I have hunted in the manner he described before.  I asked him about the techniques he was using, even discussing his firearm of choice, and how he worked with the other members of his party.  I wanted to get into the scene of his experience so I will reproduce here the story I asked him to recount in his own words.  \"Hey Sherman, Thanks for the fast response.The skies were of course cloudy, and there was no wind. The ground was wet from earlier rain that day. There wasn't any fog, so you could see very clearly. What made me think that it wasn't a deer was really two things, one being that it was simply too loud, and second, it was moving toward me instead of away. Deer always move away, and snort when things don't seem right. This thing crashed through the woods like he owned it. My dad told me to walk like a deer does, that way they're less likely to spook. I would take a step or two then look all around for deer. This many years have gone by and the thought just hit me, \u0093I wonder if it thought I was a deer and was trying to capture me by mistake.\u0094 Who knows? The thing was definitely moving to me as it stepped that\u0092s why I crouched down and stayed still. That is when it stepped into the same row of trees as me. I would describe the noise as pushing through the trees with the dead dry one breaking as it went. But now I wonder if it knew I was a human because it would have scared away a deer with all that noise. That kind of makes more sense. When the thing got close, that\u0092s when I got the smell of it. The smell was really nasty, kind of like a cross between rotten road kill, and a gut pile. It was really strong. I was crouched, and the branches of the pine trees were dead from the ground to about four feet up the trees. I saw the leg when it stepped into the row where I was. I forgot to mention in the earlier letters that the leg was about six, or seven inches around. The hair was about three inches long and matted, like it was dirty and hadn't been washed in a while. I couldn't see higher than four feet up because of the branches were blocking the view for me to see any higher. I also wonder if it just wanted me to know he was there so that I'd leave his turf. If he had squatted down like I did he would have saw me. I wasn't saying anything. It stood still for about ten or twelve minutes waiting for me to move. It then walked away. I stayed still until I couldn't hear it anymore. The rifle I was using was a 30-30. I did feel very threatened at the time because I had never seen anything like this before. I kept the experience to myself for years because I didn't think anyone would believe what I saw. A good ten years went by before I told anyone. But they thought I was making it up. I guess it's one of those things you have to see to believe. I hope this answered any questions you had. Thanks again for the fast response.\"The idea that one might mistakenly become the hunted, is the most fascinating aspect of this story.",

            "Observed": "I had just moved to an area called Green Bluff Northeast of Spokane with my Grandparents. I was 14 years old at the time and was fascinated with the area having moved there from Louisiana. Mount Spokane can be seen on a clear day from where we lived and I asked my Grandparents permission to hike up the mountian some weekend. I was told NO due to the distance and the winter conditions. The next weekend I walked up the \"Day Road\" that led me to the top of Mount Kit Carson. I could see the top of Mount Spokane from the peek of Mt. Kit Carson and it looked increbibly close. Thinking no one would know I decided to hike to the top of the mountian. It was snowing very hard and I was cutting a fresh trail waist deep as I hiked above the timber line toward the top of the mountian. After reaching the summit I decided I better follow my tracks back so I didn't get lost in the storm. About 300 feet above the timber line I discovered tracks leading away from mine going on around the mountian. Something with HUGE feet  had followed me from the  timber line part way up the mountian. The tracks looked like bear feet but were very big and it was obvious the (thing) was walking on it's hind feet. I had never heard of Big Foot so could only think it was a huge bear. Then other thoughts came to mind! It's the middle of winter -- shouldn't bears be hibernating? He must have gotten hungry!! I ran down the mountian as fast as I could in the deep snow and soon saw when the (thing) had found my tracks and started following me. It looked like the (thing) had been walking on it's hind feet the whole time and had stayed just below the timber line until it found my tracks.",
