I was 16 years old at the time and my cousin was 25, so quite a few years have passed since this sighting happened.

            "Observed": "On the morning of October 21, 1978, my dad, uncle, cousin and I awoke in preparation for opening day deer season. After spending the night in my Grandfathers cabin up Alder Gulch, we geared up for an early morning hunt. My cousin and I rode in the back of my uncles pick-up truck with my dad riding shotgun. We planned on hunting the ridge to the west of my Grandfathers cabin. We had to drive about 2 miles south or as I would call it (up) Alder gulch to get to the road that goes to the ridge. We missed the turn to the ridge road, but quickly realized our error. Upon finding the correct road we progressed up the gradual slope climbing and meandering through mostly pine and some meadows dominated by waist-high sage brush. Of course, being opening deer season my cousin and I were being vigilant scanning every opening and meadow.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The two cousins were together with their fathers on opening day of deer season. While driving up Alder Gulch to hunt, the cousins one aged 15, the other 24, were standing in the truck bed leaning on the cab, looking for deer.  As they passed a clearing the cousins witnessed a large, dark, bipedal figure walking up towards the ridge.  It appeared that the figure was uniform black in color, had turned its face towards them. They both say they could tell it had been walking and the truck had surprised it and it froze. Because it was walking up the hill, leaning forward in doing so, it looked almost like it was crouching - but because it was going up hill it was leaning.  Because of the rising sun, facial details could not be seen. The older cousin hit the cab, and told the driver to backup. In the few seconds it took to back-up a few feet the figure was gone. Knowing it wasn\u0092t a bear and not a hunter, the older cousin turned to ask his cousin if he had seen the figure too. He found his cousin wide-eyed and teary. He had seen it too.Once up the ridge, the cousins didn\u0092t see prints (if it had been a hunter that continued in the direction it was headed, it would have left footprints on the ridge.) They discussed how it wasn\u0092t a bear, and that a person couldn\u0092t be so fast to move to the trees in such a manner.  Although feeling on edge, they split up in different directions to hunt which was the usual, but after a few minutes decided to stay together. They both felt the uncanny feeling of being watched.It should be noted that if it had been a hunter it would not have been dressed all in black, and after having seen other hunters would most likely have let them know he was in the area to avoid being shot.Both cousins agree that what they saw was larger than a human and not a hunter, and that it was not a bear.  Both say it did not have a neck.  Both recall it disappeared from sight much too quick to be human. The older cousin knows what it is not: a bear or a hunter. The younger cousin knows it to be a bigfoot. Both men now living in different states, told their similar story very sincerely. I found them extremely credible.Location:",

It was getting very cold so we got into the car, cranked the car up and started to back up and leave when a very dark large figure ran across the road into the woods. It looked man like.  I turned towards the figure but couldn\u0092t see anything. It was entirely too large to be a black bear and definitely wasn\u0092t an elk. I haven\u0092t seen any at all this weekend. The figure was very black. The hairs on my arm and back of my neck stood up straight I have never in my life been so afraid.",
