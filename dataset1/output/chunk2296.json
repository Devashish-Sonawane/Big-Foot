            "Observed": "Hi, my name is Joe, I'm 20 years old. I recently had an encounter that was definitely unexplainable. First, let me start out by telling you the story from the very beginning. I am from Albuquerque, NM and the closest camp spots to me are in the Jemez Mountains. I have a friend who frequents the Jemez Mts. to go hunting and camping. A couple years ago my buddy told me a story about an encounter he had recently had in Jemez. He said that he had recently gone on a camping trip with his uncle Mike and his family. They went to a spot in Jemez that he called \"the meadow.\" He told me that about an hour before sun down him and his family were at the camp spot and they all hear a huge shreeking sound appx 3 or 4 hundred yards away. He told me that the sound had lasted for about 30 secs to 1 min. As he told me this he asked me the question \"What kind of animal do you know that has the lung capacity to hold a call for that amount of time?\" Him and his family were sitting around the campfire at sundown. He told me he could see the sky and there was just enough light out to see in between the trees on the ridge (the meadow is in a small valley with two ridges on either side of the camp spot). As everyone was sitting around the campfire he told me that he would look up at the ridge and see something walk upright in between the trees. He told me the being would walk back and fourth in between trees until sundown. He said he didn't call attention to the being because his girlfriend and sisters were camping there and he didn't want to cause a scare. He and his family go to sleep and are awakened in the middle of the night to the shreeking sound. Only this time the shreeking sound is up on one of the ridges. He said the sound was so loud that he could literally feel the bass of the sound. This shreek lasted about a minute and a half as he described it. I was very interested in this and my friend told me that the spot was originally his uncle Mike's camp spot from when he was a little kid. I talked to his uncle Mike about the story. Uncle Mike is a backwoods hunter camper who has been all over the country to hunt. When I talked to Mike he was genuinely afraid of the campspot. He told me that he had been experiencing strange things in this campspot since he was a young boy. He recalled a time when he was seven and he was camping with his brother and his mother. He said whatever was out there scared his mother so bad that she packed camp in the middle of the night and left. He told me he wouldn't go back. My friend and I eventually persuaded him to go camping with us. So last summer my friend, Uncle Mike, my friend's Uncle Richard, and myself went to the very campspot where the noises were heard. We stayed five nights and heard nothing. There were noises but nothing definite. Well about a month ago I took my girlfriend to the campspot and we stayed a few nights and heard nothing.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness in early October, we set up a small  expedition to the site of the encounter. Myself, my daughter and a fellow NM investigator met the witness at a nearby cafe on a Saturday morning and proceeded to the meadow and set-up camp. As soon as camp was set up we explored the area. Not far from the meadow we found a trackway of what looked like a bipedal animal had crossed the old logging road. We followed the trackway for six to seven hundred yards. Along the way we found several old large size elk bones that looked  to have been broken open with a rock. That is when my daughter found a new trackway with some very clear footprints going up a small hill. That evening my daughter, fellow investigator Boyd and Joe along with his cousin went out late around 10 pm to a ridge just east of camp on top of the ridge. My daughter thought she saw some eye-shine coming from a thick grove of trees and then the eyes disappeared and what looked like a large shadow moved away from them. The group worked their way back to camp and went to bed for the night. Later that night a storm moved in and started to snow, all parties decided to pack up and get out before we got snowed in. Future investigations will be scheduled for this site. I found the witnesses to be very credible and after checking the area I think the area warrants further investigation.",

            "Observed": "In October 2010 I was bow hunting on Camp Robinson military compound in North Little Rock, AR on Approximately 23,000 acres. I was hunting between two mountain ridges in the bottom of the valley approximately 100 yards from a thick creek bottom. I started the afternoon hunt at 2:30 pm finding my way to a new stand set up. I hunted all afternoon seeing alot of good deer sign in the area. After what started to be a promising day in the deer woods. I did not see a deer all day and the sun starting going down behind the mountain ridge to my west. It was getting so dark out that I could no longer see thru my peep sight. So, I decided to start packing up my backpack and start my decent down the tree. By now, it was well after dark and without my headlamp I could not see 3 foot in front of me. As I started to make my way down the tree. I heard the most disturbing sound in the woods that I have ever heard in my life. It was a very, very, loud, deep toned, gravely, blood curdling Growl/yell which seemed to be approximately 150/200 yards away from me to my southeast. It sounded as if someone was trying to yell for help. I immediately froze to the side of the tree and tried to gather my thoughts on what it could be. I originally thought that it was a person in the woods trying to play a prank on me. Mainly, because I had seen a pickup truck drive down the distant ridge several hours earlier. Then I realized that it was too loud to be a human screaming in the woods. I remained frozen to the side of the tree for several more minutes and tried to gather my thoughts of what could have made that sound. I am 43 years old and have been an avid hunter every year in some capacity since I was 6 years old and I have never heard anything like this in my life. After several minutes I finally made my way to the base of the tree, packed my stand, grabbed my bow and started to walk out on the trail that I walked in on into the direction of the \"sound\". I had about a 50 yard SE walk towards the \"sound\" then 100 yards west to an old logging road then 300 yards north back to where my truck was parked beside a small pond. So, as i left the tree walking SE and arrived at the west trail. I got a very uneasy feeling like something was watching me. So, I stopped to listen. Its was then I heard the \"sound\" again. It appeared to be moving closer to my location and approximately 50 yards away. Needless to say, I did not stick around to see what it was, for all I had was a headlight, bow in hand and a gut knife on my hip. So, I immediately start sprinting toward my truck. I have NEVER been so scared in my entire life. I started my truck and got the hell out of there. On my drive out of Camp Robinson. I called several of my closest friends and my dad and told them of the encounter. I stayed up all night on the internet to research this sound that I heard in the woods that night. I listened to mountain lions, african lions, tigers, bears, bobcats, foxes, coyotes, wild boars, etc... and I could not find anything that would come close to what I heard. The very next day. I drove back to the same area at Camp Robinson where I heard the \"sound\". Again right at dark from the comfort of my pickup truck with a pistol in my hand. I heard the sound again further down the valley approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile away. I was a very distinct sound, very loud.... Since, these three occurrences. I have hunted at Camp Robinson on many more occasions and I have not heard this \"sound\" again. Still baffles me to this day of what I heard those two nights and I have still never heard anything like it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After reviewing and discussing the report of this incident with the witness several times by phone, the one detail that he was able expand on is a more detailed description of the sounds he heard during the initial incident and those he heard after returning to the site the next night at about the same time. He stated that all three of the sounds were basically the same, and each was a \"very, very loud, deep toned and gravely, blood curdling growl/yell.\" During our discussion he stated that because of the volume and tone of the sound he is convinced it could not have been made by a human, although the sounds had some human-like qualities. He described the sound as a very loud growling and prolonged vocalization of  \"Heeeeeeey\" ending with a short and sharp \"P\" sound. For that reason when he first heard it, he briefly thought someone may have been calling for help.The sounds he described have also been heard and reported by dozens of others (including the writer) in various areas of the southeastern states.The investigator believes the witness is a credible observer and  was sincere in relating and describing what he heard those two nights.The location at which the witness heard these sounds is about three miles east of Grassy Lake which is part of the Bell Slough WMA. See Report#29313.The location is about five miles northeast of the point alongside I-40 at which a motorist reported seeing a gorilla-like figure at night in December of 2012. See: Report#40101.The location is less than ten miles from the sighting in the residential area of the Jacksonville Air Force Base in Report#9507.All these locations closely adjoin riparian wetlands, sloughs, bayous and swamps which are partially fed by drainage fromthe large area inside the Camp Robinson Arkansas National Guard training area and associated state Wildlife Management Areas. The areas mentioned in these reports are a part of a larger area including portions of four adjacent counties that have generated numerous reports (most of which have never been published) of the sightings and sounds of enigmatic animals for many years.",
