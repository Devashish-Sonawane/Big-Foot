On the Round Knob trail I noticed a 13-14in print that looked very human like. I could only see 4 toes but it appeared there was probably also a fifth. There's lots of moving water in the area, but I didn't see much in the way of wildlife.",

We scouted the area where fresh water and  many food sources were found to include fish, signs of deer and hog, acorns, hickory nuts, walnut, wild grapes, blackberry and blueberry bushes. We hiked to the location where he found a possible print. The area was surrounded by blueberries bushes that ripen during the reported time in July. The lower land outside the park is dotted with many farms that grow all types of produce.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness stated to me that he has never spoken about this event with anyone, including his parents and his wife.  He related the experience during a telephone interview, and the following comments and details can be added:He and his friends had abandoned their game and had spent a long time on the golf course near their homes just looking at the sky and talking.  After losing track of the time, the witness realized that he was close to being late for his curfew, and made the decision to take the shortcut home through the woods.  Although this was a route he had taken many times before without being uncomfortable about it, this night he had an uneasy feeling before entering the woods.  Although it was very dark, he knew the path enough to make his way through, so after chiding himself about being nervous, he started down the path toward home.  The witness describes the scream as very high-pitched and extremely loud, very much like a woman\u0092s scream with the exception that it was  \"like hearing it through headphones with the volume at the highest setting.\"  He remembers it being almost painful, and that the sound seemed to hit him like a blast (\"it felt like it blew me backwards\"), and caused ringing in his ears for a few seconds.  He also felt that the scream had almost a \"surprised\" quality to it.  He estimates it came from a distance of no more than perhaps thirty feet directly in front of him on the path.Immediately after the vocalization, the witness heard it take off on a diagonal path through the woods, from his 12:00 position toward his 2:00 position.  He reports that it covered a distance of between fifty and one hundred yards, through heavy woods and brush, in just a few seconds, and sounded \"like someone driving a car through the trees, it was that noisy.\" Between the sheer volume of the scream and the speed with which the subject exited the woods, the witness reported that \"It was the most scared I've ever been in my life,\" and that \"I never ran that fast in my life,\" to get home.  He remembers there being a lot of garbage left in dumpsters around the area at the time, as the summer visitors had only recently left, and speculates that maybe that was the draw for whoever or whatever it was being there.This was the last time the witness was out with his friends at night, as his family moved a month later.  He recalls no other unusual events prior to this one.  He noted no smell associated with this occurrence, and saw nothing, as it was very dark in the woods.  He has, however, visited the area as an adult, and reports that it is now all paved and developed with year-round residential homes.  During the interview, the witness repeatedly stressed the extreme, almost painful volume of the vocalization, and the speed with which the subject moved through the woods.   Although he is not at all assuming this was a bigfoot encounter, it is something that has stayed with him through the years and has always made him wonder.  ",
