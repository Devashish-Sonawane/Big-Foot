This trip was early winter. The following are links to the recordings:First SoundSecond Sound He has never heard anything like this. Thinking perhaps other campers were possibly making the vocalizations he drove around to search the area the next day and did not find any other camps.The calls came from the southwest starting around 10:45 pm he estimated that they originated about one mile away.  He heard three sets of calls lasting over a period of 35 minutes and seemed to move closer to his location each time. Retrieving his digital recorder from his vehicle he was able to record some of the calls.  I have listened to them and there is alot of noise on the recordings but I was able to hear the sounds.  I agree that with this witness that the calls were weird, as in not what I would expect to hear from any known animal in this area. After listening to recordings on the BFRO website he said that one of the calls was similar to the 2004 Mississippi Howl. I have listened to the sounds and agree with the similarity.Another investigator and I visited this location two weeks after the incident.  We found good water supply and deer sign from around the same time as the incident.",
