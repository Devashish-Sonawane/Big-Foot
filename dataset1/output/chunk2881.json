The bipedal creature was sighted at a distance of 200 yards, not 50 yards as in her description. The other witness never talked about it again after that day and the two have not been in contact for over 25 years.Additional comments from the witness:  The sasquatch was big, but no other dimensions could be determined. The creature paused as it crossed the road, then turned and faced the bike riders as they approached. It looked at them, then again turned and continued to cross the road. It disappeared into the thick cover. When they got to the crossing area, they saw nothing and pedaled home stricken with fear. They told their parents who did not take them seriously and the entire matter was dropped. The witness  distinctly remembers being woke up late at night by \"horrible\" loud screaming vocalizations. These lasted for weeks in the general area of the neighborhood.",
