            "Observed": "It was Thursday 11/25/11 at approximatly 8:20 just outside of Albion Oklahoma. I have 50-acres of mountain hunting land on K-trail mountain road. It was lightly raining and around 50 deg. I was by myself setting up a second feeder for the morning hunt. I walked approximatly 30 yards off the road to move some brush and I heard a very strange howl/growl. It was just on the other side of the road by my truck. I started heading back to my truck and it howled again. I had never heard anything like this before. I yelled back at it, and it responded with a more aggressive howl. Shortly after that a large rock came up through the brush and landed in the road. This exchange of howls/growls went on for 20-minutes. I never saw anything but I can tell you it wasn't a bear or deer. I guess there is something to the sign I saw on Indian highway \" Indian HWY Home of Bigfoot\".",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with RW by phone on two different occasions. During these phone interviews additional information was discussed. RW has been an avid hunter most of his life. Having spent a lot of time in the woods he has never had anything like this happen before. This property was purchased for hunting as it is next to the Honobia Creek Wildlife Management Area. This WMA is 930,000 acres of the Ouchita National Forest and Weyerhaeuser owned timberland. And is home to many deer, hogs, turkey, black bear, mountain lions and some elk. At the bottom of his property is the Long River which flows year round and is a good water source.RW explained the rock thrown was around 10 lbs. and had to have traveled at least 50-60 yards from the nearest tree line, out of his field of vision.. He also, in retrospect, recalled hearing sounds come from the woods while camping there. Sounds he called tree breaks and on one occasion late at night he heard what he thought sounded like children talking in the woods. RW also told me of a story his neighboring land owner spoke about after hearing of his story. He told RW of a sighting and encounter he and his son had at his cabin.In talking to RW I found him to be a very credible witness, who I believe had an encounter with a sasquatch.  ",

            "Environment": "Pine woods some hard oks, above the  river. They call this spot the rocks, because the river gets real nelrow here and swift, then it opens up to this big pound looking area. The ground is like hard rock before it opens. On the other side of the river is a island mostly swamp with a lot of river oaks.  About a mile from the dam by road and maybe a half mile by boat. The river is broad and about a foot or two deep until you get to the rocks, then it closes up and get's swith and deep. Once it opens up to the pond area it get real calm and about 25 ft deep. Going down river island on left get to rocks and pound area look to the right and you will see a clift about 40 or 50 ft tall. We camp above the clift. That river can rise without notice. Can't tell you much about the island I've only fished along the banks never been on it. Once you get this far down the river your in nomans land for a long ways down the river. And there are some big gaters in there.",
