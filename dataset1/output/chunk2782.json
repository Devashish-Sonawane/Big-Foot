            "Observed": "I used to work as a bartender in Canaan Valley WV and lived at the base of Dolly Sods Wilderness Area. On a mid-summer night around probably 3am, I had driven home, which was about a half hour drive. We had no neighbors and there were no lights on as I pulled up. I parked with the left side of my vehicle facing towards the wilderness line which was about 100 feet uphill. I got out of my car and closed the door. Immediately after my car door closed I had the loudest, most intense scream I have ever heard in my life call out from near the wood line. I ran for the door of the house and once inside I grabbed a shotgun, floodlight, and went back to look outside for it, from inside the screen door of course. I never saw a thing or found a sign of anything. This was the first of three times this happened to me, my mother who lived there as well and also worked late had it scream at her several times(she said 4 or 5) as well, and my brother had it scream at him once.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After conversing with the witness, the following information may be added to this report:The screaming incidents occurred repeatedly to various members of the family over several summers. They also heard other vocals regularly, but very late at night during the summer months. The witness and his brother would listen to distant howling moans for hours and he believes the vocalizer visited the area seasonally, possibly due to abundant food resources in the area.After reviewing vocals on the BFRO website, the witness learned some of the vocals he had heard were known to others as moan howls, whoops, and samurai chatter. He reports not hearing any incidents of wood knocks, rock clacks, or stone throwing.He describes the vocals he heard as very loud, as if they were being amplified.  They had a threatening quality to them, and he believes the intensity of the vocals could not be produced by any person. Some vocals would often start as a low tone, then quickly ascend to a high pitched snarling scream. He described them as unearthly, almost as if produced by multiple voices, but he is sure it was just one. He and his family only heard the vocals of an individual, and not a group of vocalizers.His mother, who also heard the vocals, thought it was a werewolf because the calls resembled something from the film \"Werewolf in London\", with a snarling, growling, howling, scream-from-hell quality.To hear more suspected sasquatch vocals similar to those described here, be sure to check out the clips linked at the bottom of BFRO Report 32981 \"Farmers record interesting vocalizations west of Clare\" from Isabella County, Michigan.",
