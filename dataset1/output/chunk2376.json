            "Observed": "It was a bright sunny summer day. My 14 year old daughter and I were on our way to pick up my 16 year old daughter. I was watching the road ahead and saw a figure cross the road from one treeline on the west side of zz to the east side treeline. We were about 800 ft . away. I ask my daughter to look and tell me what she saw, she said \" Bigfoot or something like it\". It looked about 7 ft. tall and 300 lbs. It had a long lope as it cleared the road in seconds and by the time we were where it had been, there was no sign, not that I stayed long. It looked like it had long hair. The next weekend my neighbor came over and mentioned that her 6yr. old granddaughter had came in the other day yelling grandma theres a monster in the field. She just brushed it off, and I never told her what we saw.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with M.F. via telephone about his experience.  While M.F. passionately and adamantly stated that he heard something unknown to him that evening, it remains unclear exactly what it was that he heard.  M.F. stated that he was very quick to dismiss animals such as cows, coyotes, hogs, big cats, etc., having grown up hearing the sounds of such animals.  M.F. thinks it was a sasquatch that made the sounds based on sasquatch vocalization recordings that he heard on the internet.     M.F. stated that whatever the origin of the sounds, he was overcome with a feeling of angst and fright.  A veteran of the United States Navy, M.F. stated that he is not easily frightened, but this particular evening he knew fear.  In attempting to replicate the sounds of his experience, M.F. stated that the sounds were beyond any that he had ever heard in a natural setting.  The first experience was a series of three screams.   In talking to M.F., he stated that he again heard the same sounds in August 2003 while in bed in his home in the early morning hours.  This time, his wife, who is a veterinarian, heard and was awakened by the sounds.  M.F.'s wife was unable to identify the source of the sounds.  This time there were two screams to be heard and the source of the screams seemed to be less than \u00bd mile away.     M.F. stated that no other unusual signs (unknown tracks, unknown scat, unknown hair samples, breaking of branches, animal carcasses, etc.) have been noted on his property of 10 acres.  He also stated that he has two neighbors within a mile of his property but he has not spoken to them of the incidents to determine if they have experienced anything unusual.  He now intends to discuss the matter with his neighbors and is not reticent in the least about so doing.  M.F. stated that he would notify the BFRO immediately should he experience any other anomalous events. It is my assessment that M.F. (and his wife) definitely heard something unusual more than once.  However, there is no way to ascertain at this time what originated the sounds and therefore, whether or not a sasquatch is the source of the sounds is indeterminate.     ",
