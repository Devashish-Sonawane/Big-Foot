            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was a brand new, 19 year-old soldier going through basic training when he had this encounter. He was so new that he had not even been issued a weapon yet. The witness described himself as a city boy from San Jose, California who was unused to the heavily wooded areas of the Pacific Northwest.The witness\u0092s assigned duty was to patrol the perimeter of the barracks area. He carried a folding shovel instead of a weapon. He came to a field that was about 100 yards to the tree line. In front of the tree line was a black figure that moved with an unusual, swaying gait. When the figure stopped walking and held still, it blended so well into its background that it looked just like a stump or tree.The soldier couldn\u0092t believe his eyes because there were not supposed to be any personnel out at that time of night. He looked to the left and right of the figure, then back at it, just trying to figure out what he was seeing. What made it look unusual was the \"huge\" size (much taller and bulkier than a man), the way it was able to blend into the background and its peculiar swaying walk. The witness said the shoulder area was exceptionally broad and that the figure looked \u0093big on top.\u0094The young man was scared by what he saw and decided to go back inside the barrack. He told no one for fear he would be forced to \u0093investigate\u0094 what was out there. He said his folding shovel didn\u0092t seem like a very effective weapon against an animal of this size.At the time of the sighting, the witness did not know what he was observing. It was not until he saw an article about sasquatches that he determined what he might have seen.Fort Lewis is almost 16 square miles in size and has a long history of possible sasquatch activity within its borders.",
