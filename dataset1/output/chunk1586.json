            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness (D.N.) and his mother were interviewed about the incident. D.N. has provided the following additional details -- The animal was approximately 8 - 9 feet tall; D.N. estimated that it weighed \"hundreds\" of pounds; its shoulders were very broad; the top of its head toward the back was pointed; no ears were visible; it had a nose that was shaped somewhere between a gorilla's nose and a human's nose; its hands were human-like; its hair was somewhat long; and its brow ridge protuded noticably. - The animal walked on two legs and was slightly hunched over as it walked. It had a smooth gait, moderately bent knees, and strides approximately 5 - 6 feet in length. Its arms also swung from front to back noticably as it walked.- D.N. sketched the animal after arriving home shortly after the sighting. He stated that he was quite shaken by the event and was therefore not able to sketch it accurately that evening. The next morning he made a second sketch after having calmed down from the prior evening. This second sketch was analyzed and determined to be of very high quality and accuracy.- The witness and his family returned to the location the next morning and videotaped the area of the sighting. Because the sighting occurred prior to the rainy season, the ground was extremely hard. Nonetheless, one track was identified and cast. Other possible tracks were noted but they were not clear enough to cast. The track which was cast was roughly rectangular and measured 11 1/2 inches in length, 5 5/8 inches in width, and 3/4 inch deep. The details of the track were very poor because of the hard ground surface and grassy/rocky ground cover; accordingly, no individual toe or skin impressions were discernable. Further, it is not clear whether the track represents a total foot impression or a partial impression. The cast was analyzed by the investigator; its relative width suggests a non-human bipedal animal and is consistent with sasquatch morphology. Although unlikely due its unique morphology, it cannot be ruled out that the cast represents a natural depression or that of another animal. The lack of detail in no way detracts from the sighting but, instead, simply reflects the poor, hard ground surface in the area.  - D.N. stated that it was clearly not a bear and that it was far too large to be a human.- The witness, his mother, and his cousin were driving west bound on New Mexico State Route 134 at the time of the sighting. The animal was seen walking approximately 60 yards north of the highway near a stream in a grassy meadow not far from the pine forest.D.N. is a credible witness and careful observer. Although his mother was also in the vehicle, she did not see the animal because she was simultaneously driving and attending to a small child. She fully supported her son's sincerity and his skills as an observer. ",
