            "Observed.1  ": "The site is in McKean County, despite reports stating otherwise. Prior to the expedition, Mateja explained what would happen. \u0093What we\u0092re going to do, we\u0092ll wait until it is quite late \u0097 11 o\u0092clock or maybe later,\u0094 he said. \u0093We\u0092ll try the wood knocks again. I\u0092ve got two branches, two-and-a-half, three inches thick, maybe 18 inches long, hard wood, really cured. When you tap those together at night, they really carry. \u0093We\u0092ll tap those together and wait for a response,\u0094 he said. The theory behind the knocks is the Bigfoot creatures live in a colony and use the knocks for communication.      After Tom and his brother Rick Jacobs had sought the BFRO\u0092s help in identifying the animal captured by the game camera, Mateja and Tom Jacobs had made an excursion to the site to see if they could find any signs of a Bigfoot. Tom Jacobs explained he had gone into the first expedition a non-believer, but after hearing responses to the wood knocks, he came out a skeptic. On Saturday\u0092s trip, there was no response to the knocking, despite repeated attempts. Mateja said with a laugh that Bigfoot doesn\u0092t perform on cue. \u0093It could be exciting, or it could be nothing \u0097 you don\u0092t know,\u0094 he said of the expeditions. \u0093It\u0092s like fishing,\u0094 Bogdan said. \u0093Except we\u0092re going after something a little different than fish,\u0094 Mateja said, laughing. \u0093If they are in the area and are interested, you may hear them moving around the camp around us,\u0094 he explained. \u0093There might be some intimidation behavior. They might make a lot of noise and try to scare us. Some people have said they have had stones thrown at them.\u0094 No stones were thrown at expedition members on Saturday, and most of the noises heard were easily attributed to coyotes or owls. At times, it appeared as though something would move along a ridge line parallel to the hikers. When the hikers stopped, so did the movement. \u0093They will pace you in the woods, just following you,\u0094 Mateja had explained before setting out. However, nothing came out to investigate the expedition members \u0097 not even the two females present. Mateja had said that something about the female voice attracts Bigfoot, and said it is like the creatures sense less of a threat from women. However, if there was any sort of unclassified creature in the woods in the ANF over the weekend, it will remain unclassified for awhile longer. Then again, Mateja, Bogdan and even Jacobs \u0097 an admitted skeptic, all said they felt that maybe the mystery is what keeps people interested in Bigfoot. \u0093If it becomes known that they are out there, it may become a detriment to both man and beast,\u0094 Mateja said. \u0093Like the grizzly bear. It\u0092s a monstrous beast, but nobody cares about it,\u0094 Jacobs said. There aren\u0092t many expeditions to go see grizzlies in their habitats. Mateja added that perhaps acknowledging a mystery creature in the ANF would help create tourism for the Pennsylvania Wilds initiative. \u0093There\u0092s no shortage of people who do this,\u0094 he said, explaining an expedition is planned for next year to bring people into the area to search for signs of the creatures. \u0093This could be a big money-maker for Pennsylvania.\u0094 ",
