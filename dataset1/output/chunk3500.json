            "Observed": "We have 3 dogs: a 100-pound Rottweiler, a 70-pound bird dog (hunting dog), and an 80-pound Shepard-mix. The Rottweiler barks mostly at animals, the bird dog barks at anything making noise, and the Shepard only barks if he hears or sees something too close to the house. These dogs are very close to our house. All three dogs were barking like crazy, carrying on pretty bad. I said to my fiancee, \"what are they barking at, i'd like to get some sleep\". We thought it was deer or coyote. Well, about a minute after that, the dogs got dead quiet, not a peep. So I started to relax. Not a minute after they got quiet, I heard a yell that I have never heard before. It sounded almost like a man with a deep, grumbly voice that was just yelling, \"aaah\". It was loud and the voice got deeper at the very end. Almost like it was mad. Well, it brought chills to me, I asked my fiancee if he heard it, he said he did, but he was half-asleep. I was wide awake. The dogs never made another sound. I know that the noise we heard was not a cat or a dog. I'm not familiar with the sound of a mountain lion, but as the old cliche goes, \"it didn't sound completely human, but it didn't sound completely animal\".",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with both witnesses separately, during a phone conversation on November 11, 2003 and found both to be very candid and credible. Both witnesses are sure the sighting occurred during the summer, however they were unsure whether it was '76, '77 or '78. He and she would have been around 26 and 21 years of age respectively, at the time of the sighting.While driving along a secluded, dark road (through primarily deciduous woodland) between 1 and 2 AM, a bipedal creature suddenly entered the road from the left, basically walking out directly in front of the vehicle.  The husband, who was driving, had to \"slam\" on the breaks to avoid hitting the creature at which time it stopped in front of the car (within arms length), turned its head (not body) and looked at the witnesses for a brief moment. There was no describable facial expression other than a \"blank look\". It then continued to cross the road and disappeared into the woods. Its gait was estimated to be two to three feet in length and natural/smooth/fluid-like. The arms were alternately swinging front to back and it seemed to be in no extreme hurry. It's estimated that the entire sighting lasted no more than 10 seconds. The witnesses describe the creature as walking with a somewhat hunched/bent posture and it was around 6 feet tall in the hunched position. It was covered with straight, brown hair except for its face, which was a brownish colored \"skin\". The length of the hair was not uniform but generally appeared to be \"collie like in length\", and there was more hair on the arms and less around the face and head. It did not have a particularly large physique, weighing around 200-250lbs. However, the husband did state that it \"could have kicked the crap out of me.\" Gender could not be determined.The creature's head was described as \"smaller at the top, and seemed to widen on the sides near the outer cheeks where the ears would be\". No ears were observed. The face had a \"human structure\" with the cheekbones appearing prominently. The eyes appeared to be somewhat sunken and while there was no \"eye shine\" noticed they were described as \"striking\" and very \"human-like\". The lips were thin and the mouth relatively small. The nose was flat and the wife remembered that the nostrils were \"wide\". Both witnesses indicated the mouth was closed and thus no teeth were seen. The arms hung to just above the knees and were described as \"sinewy, not bulky; orangutan-like\". The hands were somewhat hair covered, \"pretty big\" and \"were not a paw\". No fingernails could be seen and there were no claws. The legs were also said to be \"sinewy but not bulky or skinny\". The thigh/hip area appeared to be \"meatier\". Due to the closeness of the creature to the vehicle, the witnesses could not see below the upper calf and thus the feet were not observed.When asked what their reaction was to the encounter, the wife said, \"Scared out of my mind\" and her husband described it as shocking, wondering, \"What the hell was that?\" Both are adamant that it was not a bear as it was \"totally upright the entire time\". I can attest that while the black bear population is currently approaching problematic levels in northern New Jersey, at the time of this encounter there were very few, if any, bears in this area.",
