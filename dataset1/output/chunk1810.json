            "Observed": "I was with a group of bow hunters in a canyon above Pilot Rock, Oregon.  My 12 year old daughter and I were sitting in the brush waiting for the rest of the party to push the elk to us.  We had been sitting in the dense trees since early in the morning (about 6 am) and it for about three hours, as my daughter wasn't keen on hiking through the canyon.  We had been bugling during the entire time.  Because it was early fall, it was quite foggy up in the high areas.  My daughter and I had been hearing what sounded like a branch thumping against the trees from down below us, but steadily approaching our hiding spot.  I thought nothing of the sound because one of the party was carrying antlers to \"rattle\" the elk.  Eventually, the two of us began to hear distinct rustling noises near us with a grunting and growling sound.  The stench was unbelievable.  It smelled like a combination of wet mop and wet dog hair that had moldered for awhile.  I have been around a bear carcass and it did not smell like this.  I was, quite frankly, spooked!  My daughter was likewise wanting to get out of the woods.  We immediately climbed up the canyon wall to where the four wheelers were.  The crashing sounds followed us.  When the rest of the party caught up with us they said that they had seen me walking along the hill.  Where they said they had spotted me was in no where close to where my daughter and I had been as it was straight down a pretty ragged elk trail that I would not have tried with my kid along.  I have never been comfortable in that area again and refuse to hunt without someone with me.  I have tried telling many people about this but even my daughter who was with me scoff and say it was a bear.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness stated that she has hunted since she was a little girl, and the sounds she heard and the smell were not of a familiar animal. When she heard it in the bushes, the hair stood up on the back of her neck, and she couldn\u0092t get out fast enough. She said it seemed like something entirely different, and that it had not crept up \u0096 it was \u0093all of a sudden there.\u0094 She never heard footsteps, and when she heard it in the brush, it sounded like it was 10-12 feet away. She said she knew it was not a bear or cat, because she knows the feeling of those animals, and this was different. She said she has never been so scared and still is. The witness seems to have experienced something extraordinary given her many years of experience with hunting and familiarity with the woods.",

The road curves a bit, then you go up a small hill, and as I as coming down the small hill near the RR crossing I saw a HUGE, 7-8 foot, 300-400lb, creature walking with its back to me on my side of the road. It was silvery white/grey with dark grey roots and grey patches. It had very broad shoulders and almost no neck. I dont think its head was pointed. It was almost leisurely walking down the road. I was so scared, I didnt know whether to stop, honk, or turn around, so i kept driving.",
