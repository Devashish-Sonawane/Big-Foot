            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with witness and the following is from our conversation.The witness was with his father at the time of the sighting.  His father had downed a bull elk that morning and they were in the process of packing the animal out.  They had to make four trips to pack out the animal, about a three-hour pack back to the truck.  They were on the third and last trip of that day. They had driven the witness\u0092 truck to a point and then used an ATV to get to Lewis Peak. Permission was needed from the landowner to use the area for travel, and then it was another three-hour hike to where the elk was harvested, the slopes being up to 70%.They were walking back to the ATV and just crossed an open area on an icy, steep shale slope and the witness looked back at the area they had just crossed, approximately 500 yards away, to see a dark figure about 7 feet in height and moving very fast across the same slope that took minutes to cross.Because they had another twenty minutes to pack and another half hour of daylight, the witness could not look for tracks. The witness and his father were not the only ones using that area for hunting. There were other hunters, some with horses, in the same area. When they went back the next day to retrieve the rest of the elk, he looked for tracks, but because of other traffic in the area and limited time to pack the animal out there was not enough time to completely search the area for tracks.When they arrived where the elk was downed they had noticed tracks in the snow and the elk had been partially eaten. They had recognized the tracks of a bear. It appeared that this bear had finished the best cuts of the elk and partially buried the rest of it and looked to be coming back later to finish. At no time after the sighting did the witness feel any different, only after seeing that a bear had fed on their elk.  There was no feeling of being watched even when they had to return the next day. There was an abundant source of game in the area, from the other rifle shots heard in the area, and the bear was still feeding.The witnesses have a number of years hunting that area and are very comfortable in being in the outdoors, hunting, hiking, biking et cetera. They will continue to hunt the area and this sighting of a dark biped will not deter them from the area.",
