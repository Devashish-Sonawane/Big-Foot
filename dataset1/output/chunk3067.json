            "Observed": "On Sunday night, January 19th 2014, last night approximately 9 p.m. I was returning home from the school house restaurant on route 670 north of Dyberry Pennsylvania, I was heading south coming down a hill and an oncoming car had his high beams on. I glanced away from the beams and when I looked back at the road I was coming to the bottom of a dip in the road and as I looked back at the road I saw TWO VERY LARGE LEGS WITH EXTREMELY LARGE FEET ATTACHED ! I saw three strides and it was across the road and the fourth step took it up a 7 foot bank. The fur appeared to be long and very dark, almost black but with a bit of a sheen to it. The fur appeared to go all the way to the ground around the feet. Because I was approaching the bottom of the dip, my headlights were only catching the very bottom of where the road came back up and he was at the very top of my headlight beams. I backed up and pulled out a light, looked for tracks through my car window. even though I am an experienced hunter and tracker, I felt goose bumps and the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and I left after I locked the doors. I've seen many bears, three mountain lions, a fisher and many other wild animals in many areas. This was not a four legged creature.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "As described by the witness, he saw a set of very large legs and feet move rapidly across the road in front of him from left to right. Route 670 is a rural two lane road (one lane in each direction). The creature covered the distance from the left side shoulder to the right side shoulder of the road in three steps. It's fourth step was over the guardrail on the right shoulder. The witness described this last step over the guardrail as so seemingly effortless that \"It was like you or I stepping over a case of beer\".  ",

            "Observed": "I was lying in my tent on the last night of our camping trip.  I remember thinking about a story my brother told me about an incident several years earlier where he and my other brother encountered a bear in this same area.  I was on the verge of drifing off to sleep when suddenly an overwhelming sense of dread and fear overcame me.  I was immediately wide awake, but was afraid to make any noise so I remained still.  I heard footsteps very near my tent.  I could feel the presence of something very large.  It moved slowly and I could hear what sounded like deep throated breathing.  When I heard whatever it was move closer to my tent, I sat up as quietly so I could put my glasses on and grabbed my .44 magnum revolver.  I wasn't even thinking about sasquatch at the time.  I was afraid a bear had possibly wandered into camp.  I finally got the courage to turn on my flashlight and everything outside went silent.  I heard no more sounds, and never smelled anything unusual.  Then as suddenly as it started, my intense feeling of anxiety was totally gone.  I did not hear anything running away, but I felt safe and was able to relax enough to go back to sleep.  Nothing else happened that night.",

They described to me a very frightening experience with a bear that came into camp late at night.  They never saw the bear from inside their tent.  They describe a large animal, sniffing and snorting, and pushing against the sides of the tent.  They also decribed moaning and \"crying\" sounds they thought may have been a bear cub not too far away.  The next day when they hiked back down to \"base camp\" they discovered tracks and muddy prints on thier vehicle they attributed to a bear.  They think they may have been followed up the previous day.",
