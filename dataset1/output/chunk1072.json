We had just crossed the first major bridge over the Kennedy Soda Can Creek, and we doubled back a ways to a flat spot to camp for the night.  We were about 15 yards from the creek itself.  Around midnight to 1:00 a.m., I was drifting off to sleep when I heard a large, heavy, two-legged creature walking across the creek.  Since the creek was deep, I could clearly hear it splashing.  It would walk a little while, stop, then continue.  This went on for about a minute.  Although we did see another camper about 200-300 feet away, I can't imagine why someone would be walking across the creek at that time of night.",

            "Observed": "My wife and I were crossing the Trinity River on Highway 105 just before sunset on May 29, 2004 after having been to a Cardinals-Astros baseball game. The west bank of the Trinity was a long sand bar, and there were a few people (ten - fifteen) spread out along the sandbar doing various things. There were a few kids and a dad camping, two guys sitting on a tailgate, there was a couple farther down fishing, and there was another truck backed up to the sandbar with its stereo playing. My wife and and I drove down to the sandbar, had to engage the four-wheel drive to avoid getting stuck and turned around to go back to the highway (Hwy 105). We got back out on the highway and my wife asked me to drive on across the bridge to the other side. I did so. My wife saw what she called \"a waterfall\" off the left side of the bridge (actually it was just water running over rocks in a small creek off the Trinity). We turned off on a dirt road just past the bridge, drove over a small wooden bridge over my wife's \"waterfall\" and came to a gate that was locked with two padlocks. Keep in mind that the area is very heavily wooded, swampy and marshy in areas and highly inhospitable, once you step foot into the woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on 6/03/2004.The encounter took place at dusk on 5/29/2004. While it wasn't dark yet, it was a 3/4 moon that night.This encounter took place within 3/4 of a mile from a previous report from January of this year. The earlier report took place on the west side of the Trinity River, while this encounter took place on the east side of the river.The terrain was swampy, with Bald & Black Cypress. The witness and his wife were walking on a 2-track trail, a trail with 2 tire track ruts. The witness noticed a reddish-copper colored upright form leap across the trail. When he first saw it, it was in mid-air. He saw it land at the edge of the trail and then take a 2nd jump into the woods. As the witness and his wife ran up to the location it entered the woods, they could hear it run 30 yards or so into the woods, disturbing some birds which took flight. They didn't hear anymore movement at that time. His wife commented that \"it was probably watching us\" at that point. The witness noticed a very strong, musky smell at the location where it entered the woods, although his wife did not notice the smell. He described it most closely as that of a horse.He estimated the size of the creature as approximately 6 feet tall and weighing 200 pounds. The witness was struck with the speed of the creature. It moved so fast that it appeared as a reddish blur. No features or limbs could be made out, just that it appeared to be moving upright. He estimated that it was within 40 yards from him when it crossed the trail. He estimated that the time of the sighting was less than a second.They then checked out the area from which it came, noticing some uprooted trees six to seven feet into the tree line. He said that it resembled the start of a lean-to like structure. They could see through the woods across the river at this point and see several of the people that were down on the river. He surmised that it had been there examining these people when he and his wife disturbed it. It ran away from the river and entered the deeper woods across the trail.While the witness can't say with 100% certainty that what he saw was a Bigfoot, there are not many other possibilities.",
