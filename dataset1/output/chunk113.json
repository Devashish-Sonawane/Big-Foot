            "Observed": "Ok so I would like to keep this somewhat discreet because my family still to this day use what I told them as a joke against me and I don't need everyone in my town talking about me cause this just sounds ridiculous. This happened near Toms River NJ. Me and my buddy were on our way to a job in Browns Mills and we're traveling down route 70 which is known as the pine barrens. It was sometime between 6/7 am and about 7 deer came shooting out from the right side going left across route 70. I didn't slam on brakes cause it was like 50 feet in front of us but I stopped pretty fast and I kid you not there was a big hairy grey and brown thing that came running right up to about 3 feet from the pavement and it stopped and turned around and ran the other way back into the woods. Since I seen this I started watching that finding Bigfoot show but their videos and pics are always something black. This thing was light grey and brown and it was huge! I mean huge like 8 foot tall and big like fat big. It could not be a guy cause it had like hair all over its face! Like I didn't even see its eyes or lips or nose.  It was like hair for a face. We seen this thing at about 25/35 feet. I know it was real cause my man was like totally in sync with describing it to each other. It was all we talked about the rest of the way to the job. It was like what I was thinking he was saying and vice versa.  This was two months ago and that was it. Hope this helps you!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness at length by phone, and he related the details back to me exactly as stated above. I was then able to get further details from him. He and his co-worker were on their way to a job site in the early morning hours.He said they saw the herd of deer running out from the woods on the right, about 50 feet in front of them. He slowed down, and brought the truck to a complete stop about 30 feet from where they crossed the road. They both saw the creature exit out of the woods and come to a stop just before reaching the pavement. They immediately locked the doors, and stared at the figure in front of them. He said their eyes were at the level of the armpits of the creature.It stood there hunched over, and took a couple of deep inhales before turning towards them and around as it retreated back into the forest. They could see the vapor coming out of its face as it exhaled into the brisk morning air. He said it appeared as though the creature was exhausted, and seemed frustrated. He described the individual as being a male, around 8 feet tall, and extremely fat. It was covered in mostly grayish - white hair with some brown patches mixed in, which could indicate an older individual. The hair was matted, and approximately 8 to 10 inches in length. The truck windows were closed - so no odors or sounds were observed. Neither man had any prior interest in the topic of bigfoot before this encounter, but did have camping and hunting experience. They both talked about what they had seen, and were basically saying what the other was thinking all the way to the job site. Family and friends mocked the men, and they decided to google bigfoot, and came up with the Finding Bigfoot show. After watching a marathon of episodes on Animal Planet, they decided to submit the report to this website.The area that this occurred in is known as the Pine Barrens - a vast extent of land that has numerous accounts of strange events reported happening over the years. This particular location is surrounded on both sides by deciduous forest, with lots of Pine trees, and lakes and streams. There are plenty of food sources, water, and ground cover to support an as of yet undiscovered primate. I give this report a solid Class A rating.",
