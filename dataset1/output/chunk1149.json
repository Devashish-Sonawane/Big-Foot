            "Follow-Up Report": "Two of the three witnesses were contacted over the course of several months. Both men said they were more than 10 miles up a dirt road and had not seen any other people during their stay. The first witness, KT, 36, lives in the Midwest and is currently employed as a police officer. \"It almost like we felt we were invading something else\u0092s territory. We were roasting meat by the fire all day, hiking around, leaving our scent. Anything within 5 miles had to know we were there.\"  After the first vocalizations, KT said he heard a sharp snap come from the woods up the hill where the calls were coming from. \"I\u0092m a range officer with police department, I\u0092m real familiar with gunshots. This didn\u0092t have the sonic crack a gunshot has.\"As the calls continued, and one animal moved  much closer to camp, discomfort turned to alarm.  \u0093We felt, being ex-military, like someone was flanking us,\" KT said. \"I felt like we were going to get pinned in. We didn\u0092t know what to do. We were facing something unknown. They, whatever it was, were communicating and getting closer. I didn\u0092t like the odds.\"At that point, the men armed themselves. \"I drew my pistol and aimed my flashlight and I never never draw on duty or anything. It is an absolute last resort. But I felt certain something was going to break through the trees and come running across the road.\"\"There was no other sound out there, and this was loud. I can\u0092t overemphasizes how loud it was, like a big person with big lungs out there,\" he added. \"You know how you can feel base when music is playing? You could feel this thing. There was so much depth to it.\" \"We were just standing there with our hearts in our throats and starting to shake. And I mean we never get like this. Nothing fazes us.\" \u0093I\u0092ve been up against armed people before and I\u0092ve never been as scared as this.\u0094He said he is certain whatever happened wasn't a hoax. \"As a police officer I say give me the proof. I\u0092m pretty much convinced that\u0092s what it was just through elimination. I don\u0092t see anything else that it could have been.\"The second witness, JG, 41 now lives in New Mexico. He said at first, he gave the strange calls little thought. But that changed when he realized that the animals were appearing to communicate with each other. \"There were three calls in a row, perfectly spaced. I can usually imitate noises and things fairly well but I can\u0092t make noise that thing made. It sounded like \"Aooough.\" Anyway, at that point, we all pretty much had our guns out at that point. Were we scared? Oh yeah. At first we thought it might be some kind of wild dogs or something, but it was just so perfect: Three calls answered by three calls every time without fail.\" \"It was clear and loud, but it wasn\u0092t screaming. I don\u0092t know anything in the wild that makes that noise. I have hunted all my life and trapped and whatever.\" \"I couldn't see it being people. If it were a person, they would have had to make more of a yelling noise to get to that level of sound.\"Shortly thereafter JG heard something come down the hill towards them. \"It was crashing like a deer or elk or something when you get it to bust through the brush. I heard it come over hill. It came down just far enough in trees to where it couldn\u0092t be seen by light. That one started calling and it was answered  by the first one a ways off. It couldn\u0092t have been more than 50 to 60 yards in front of our fire. I don\u0092t know any animal at all that will just walk up to a fire making noises.\" \"This went on for almost an hour at 10 or 15 minute intervals - they would just call back and forth. We couldn't see anything even though we had lights going everywhere. And it was there the whole time. It just never moved.\"After the three had packed up camp and driven half an hour to get off the mountain, they could still hear the calls. \"That's the thing killed me, the noise just carried. You could hear it forever. It just did not sound like it was a bird to me.  It sounded more canine, but it wasn't a howl like a dog. The three later surmised that they may have been under surveillance by juvenile sasquatches. \"We kind of bandied that around afterwards. We kind of thought they might have been juveniles off on their own. That's pure speculation. \"But from one spot on the hill, you could see straight up into the Weminuche Wilderness. If you needed a winter quarters in the cold season, this would be a perfect place - lots of game water, and in the summer there\u0092s a path straight up to wilderness. Looking at it, you couldn't ask for anything better.\" ",
