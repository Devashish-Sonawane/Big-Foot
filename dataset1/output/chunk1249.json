            "Observed": "In the spring of 1980, I was working for the Department of Natural Resources planting trees on State lands along the Columbia River between the towns of Carson and Home Valley Washington. The whole crew saw two Sasquatches walking side by side down in a valley from where we were working. At first we thought they were bears, but no bears walk upright in perfect stride. We assumed these two were mates. Of course we had no binoculors to give us a better view. But to this day I still believe what we saw was Sasquatch.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "This is an excellent sighting, combining both multiple witnesses and a very clear view of the subjects by all involved.  The crew watched the pair of animals walking side by side for several moments at a range of about 150 yards.Although the sighting location is only a mile or so north from the hustle and bustle of the Interstate 84/Highway 14 corridor, it is still rather remote.  The Gifford Pinchot National Forest begins just a few miles further north.  The region is rugged and sparcely inhabited.  The Big Lava Bed lies only 8 miles to the North-Northeast.  The Wind River valley offers an excellent route from the Columbia River up into the forest, with plenty of natural cover for large animals.If any other witnesses to this incident wish to come forward, please contact the BFRO.  Further witness testimony regarding this incident will help greatly.",

We observed a large object in the middle of the road about 200 yards from our position.  It looked similar to a large ball or something.  My first thought was that it was maybe a tree stump or a large rock was in the middle of the road.  Then I began to wonder how such a large object ended up in the road to begin with. We continued walking towards the object.  Once we were within 100 yards of this thing, we observed this large black creature rise up from a crouched position and face us.  This thing had to have been at least 8 feet tall.  We could not make out any distinguishing features, but we did see that it was black, and appeared to have fur that sort of glistened in the moonlight.  When we saw this creature, we immediately froze (we were petrified) and observed it for about 20 seconds.  I believe it was looking at us but I can't say for sure because it was so dark.  After that, it turned and walked into the woods next to the road. After it walked into the woods, my friend and I turned around and ran pretty fast to get away from the area.",
