On the Friday night, what made him most nervous was not that the footsteps followed him to the restroom in the first place (he thought some animal may have been happening to walk in the same direction), but that they followed him back afterwards.  Also salient was that the steps were distinctly bipedal and that they did not use the trails but rather proceeded through leaves and underbrush, back inside the woods, with no light.  On Saturday night, he and a couple (whom he described as \"very practical\") heard the footsteps clearly as they sat around a campfire at the edge of the woods.  Again, the sounds came from far enough inside the woods that a flashlight could not reach the source.",
