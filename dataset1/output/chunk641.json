            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness and found him to be quite credible. There are significant details to be added to this report.First a little background on the witness.He runs his own business in the Los Angeles area. He buys and sells silicon material used to make solar panels. While attending college he was an ROTC Naval mid-shipmen and was a member of the MCW Company (mountain cold weather company). Northern New England recognizes the MCW rescue team as the one to call when no one else can complete the rescue. He has had wilderness survival training and has spent a significant amount of time in the outdoors.The witness, his cousin, and a friend arrived at Parker Meadow around 4:30am for a week of camping. Upon exiting the vehicle they began hearing what the witness described as people yelling back and forth from the SW to the SE. The voice to the SW was close enough that he feels he should have been able to understand what was being yelled, but the \"words\" did not make sense. After a few minutes the unintelligible words became loud and steady whoops. The whoops would continue steadily for a couple of minutes at a time, then multiple higher pitched responses would be heard from the SE. Once this call and answer show began, the witness deduced he was hearing a male voice calling to possibly two female voices. The male voice was whooping, and based on his description, the responding female voices were making calls that sounded like very loud sighs or ahhs. The male voice seemed to be stationary while the female voices were gradually moving towards the male.At approximately 4:45am the voices stopped altogether. The witness states that he was shocked and frightened, but very curious. His friend and cousin were also scared and confused at what they were hearing. The cousin preferred to remain in the car. It was around this time the witness thought he might be hearing bigfoots. He mentioned it and the friend was excited at the idea, but still scared, and the cousin did not have an opinion.At approximately 4:55am the call and answer resumed, continuing the same cadence as before the break. As before, the female voices were gradually moving towards the male voice. This continued for another ten minutes and stopped completely. No other unusual voices were heard.They camped near Parker Meadow for a week and did not see another person.The witness was aware of the possible existence of Bigfoot, but he had no more than a passing interest in the subject. He is now interested in pursuing the creature.",
