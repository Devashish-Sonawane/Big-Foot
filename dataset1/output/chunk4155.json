The BFRO Web site keeps a database of reported and possible sightings in the country. With 29 listings, New Jersey is not too shabby. We beat 20 other states, including Rhode Island, Delaware, Alaska and Maine. We tied New Mexico. One of the counties that propelled our humble state to its current standing is Ocean County, which reported four listings between 1970 and 1994. Burlington County leads the state with seven. Cape May, Atlantic and Cumberland counties had none. So keep your eyes open.",
