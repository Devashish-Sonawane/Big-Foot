            "Observed": "My story occured around 1991 on the San Joaquin River in what would be the northwestern part of town. Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn't to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it's whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn't more then 5 1/2 feet deep. Their was a sand bar and the boulders were at least 30 to 40 lbs.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Following a long phone interview with the witness on 7/10/05, these important details should be added to this report.-\tAt the time of the incident the witnesses, ages seventeen to twenty-one, were fishing for catfish during a full moon under the north side of a bridge about fourteen miles west of where Highway 99 meets the San Joaquin River. The area is in close proximity to several small to large sloughs and a wildlife refuge, which contains an abundance of fish, waterfowl, small mammals and reptiles.The observed coyote\u0092s frightened and strange behavior reminded the witness of a previously viewed program that discussed and showed visual examples of animals\u0092 \u0093flight instinct\u0094 from other predators.In response to the three young adults shouting and yelling, the large \u0093dark figure\u0094 was seen pivoting to its right and picked up what appeared to be large boulders from the sand bank directly behind it and began tossing them \u0093hands over head\u0094 in the witnesses\u0092 direction. The witness believes the subject's increased hostility was a direct result of being shouted at. At no time did the subject respond vocally or attempt to shorten its distance from the witnesses. Although no facial features were observed during the encounter, the witness emphasized both the large size and broad stature of the subject.  In addition, the witness perceived the figure to be hair covered due to both its dark color and what appeared to be \u0093shiny, wet fur\u0094 slightly animated by moonlight.While departing, the witnesses\u0092 felt extreme fear and anxiety. The witness was insistent that he and his two companions experienced several tense moments while trying to reach their car. They were literally \u0093climbing over each other\u0094 while having to negotiate a narrow single-file path in the back end of a vineyard before reaching a clearing. The next day, the witness took both his 6\u00922 friend and future wife rafting to the spot where the subject was observed waist deep in water. The alleged creature appeared to have waded where the river narrowed on a corner in 5 \u00bd ft. deep water. This particular pool of water reached the bottom chin of the 6\u00922 friend. After seeing this comparison, the witness estimated that the subject witnessed the previous night reached a height of between 8 \u00bd and 9 ft. Several clean boulders, weighing in excess of 30 lbs. were found laying on the river-bottom where the witness saw the huge splashes the night before. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "A drive way runs down the length of her property and parallels a pasture which at this time had very high grass. Between the house and the driveway there are bushes and trees. This is where she first encountered the creature.  There was not much light as it was night time and not a full moon. She had no flashlight.   She saw coyotes scatter as she came out of the house after hearing the dog bark. She thought the coyotes might be trying to attack her cats.  She chased the coyotes out by yelling at them and walking toward them. There was something in the darkness that did not leave. It just stayed and growled at her. She could not see anything in the darkness, but said coyotes don\u0092t usually stand their ground and growl.  She went back into the house to get her truck keys so she could shine a light with her truck lights. She said she was surprised that it was still there when she returned and got her truck lights positioned where the creature was. She did not get a clear picture of the creature but described what she saw as on all 4 legs, with grey hair about 30 feet from her. When it jumped the fence it remained on all fours. She followed it in her truck. Because of the high grass she could not see the creature clearly. She could only see like half of the creature as it ran. She could not determine the proportion of the arms and legs. The creature looked over its shoulder at her once and she saw grey skin on its face but couldn\u0092t tell much more than that. She said she couldn\u0092t really see a neck. It was more like the head sat on its shoulders.  She could really just see movement in the grass. She estimated the creature to be about 200 feet from her truck. When the creature turned and went further into the pasture it still remained on all fours. I asked her if she returned to the area the next day to see how high the grass was and look for possible footprints. She said at the time she didn\u0092t really know about Bigfoots and didn\u0092t investigate further. She said there are tales of coyote/dog hybrids in this area and thought it was probably just that.  asked what prompted her to report this at this time. She explained that since this event she has moved to another property near Huntsville and has had several encounters with what she now believes to be Bigfoot and has become more active in reading/researching Bigfoot.  She says she is not sure what she saw that night, but thinks it is possible it was a Bigfoot. And she believes the howls she heard were Bigfoot. ",
