            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with the little brother J,. who is now 13 years old.  He reported seeing a tall, black creature on the road near the woods and he said, \"It was about seven feet tall and when A. shot at it with his BB gun, it sprinted off into the woods!\"  I asked J. how big the man was compared to his father.  He said it was about two feet taller than his dad who is nearly six feet tall.  J. also stated that the man ran \"much faster than a human!\".  Both boys were a bit frightened and headed back to their cabin.  I later talked with A. who is now 19 years-old about this experience (the older brother).  He was able to describe in explicit detail, the gait, posture and movement.  A. also described the creature as \"huge, with thick, thick hair, like black rags hanging on him.\" He described the fur as being a red, brown and black mix. A said he and his brother came out of the woods onto the road to try and get their bearings when they saw this huge creature walking on the road just forty to fifty feet away from them.  A. and the creature looked at each other, and A. thought it was a man at first, then realized how huge it was and took a shot at it.  The creature sprinted off on two feet and crossed the road with five to seven steps.  A. described the distance covered by the creature as a distance that would have taken him twenty-five to thirty steps, even if he was running.  He said \" I didn't know what it was, but it walked like a human!\" Later, A. reported that when this creature ran, \"it ran much faster than a deer!\". A. also described the creature as being very wide across the shoulders.  A. stated that when the creature looked at the boys, \"his whole body turned, not just his head!\".These boys saw something that they could not explain. I talked with their mother for a few minutes and she stated that both boys really believe they saw a bigfoot.  Mom reported that the cabin is surrounded by federal land and forests. The area surrounding the scene is thickly forested with mixed hardwoods, lots of freshwater sources and a free-flowing natural spring close to their cabin.  The cabin was about one half mile away from this encounter.  This a desolate area of the Manistee National Forest.",
