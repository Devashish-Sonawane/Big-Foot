He forwarded me his photos and it was easy to distinguish between some human tracks in the area, and the \"unknown\" tracks pictured below. The tracks were first noticed by Ed's friend, Pete Coffey.  There are 23,000+ miles of legal and illegal trails in Big Cypress among 720,000 acres. The entire Everglades is 1,509,000 acres.  Thousands of acres of undeveloped private and farm land surround the preserve.The informant, Ed Casas, works as the Activities Coordinator at the Palm Beach Museum of Natural History. He has a BA in Anthropology and Social Sciences. He also volunteers at Save the Chimps in Ft. Pierce.This part of Florida is vast and teeming with plants and protein sources. The larger native fauna, such as bears, panthers and deer, are usually not visible from roads and trails during the day, but their tracks are noticeable and abundant because the area is so wet.An open invitation BFRO expedition is being organized for the area the tracks were found. The expedition is scheduled for February 14-17, 2008. If you are interested in attending, click here for more details.Here's a photo of the best left foot track.

I prayed and walked as fast as I could without running all the way home. This happened to me in 2006 in Summertown Georgia on Johnson Powell Drive. This is a true story.
