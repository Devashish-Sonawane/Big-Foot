            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with both witnesses over the phone on October 29, 2009. The following details can be added:I did visit the location twice shortly after the report was filed last year but did not hear or find anything unusual. I spoke with a Wildlife Officer that works in the area and found out there is hunting for small game during this time of year. This raised the question if what was heard was wood knocks or gun fire.The individuals that filed the report are avid hikers and enjoy the outdoors. They have hiked many of the New Jersey State Parks and Wildlife Management areas. As a result they have heard gun fire in the past and are adamant that this was wood on wood and not gun fire. After speaking with the witnesses I do believe they heard wood knocks near the Hibernia Bat Cave at Wildcat Ridge. This does not surprise me as I recorded what I believe to be the wood knocks of possibly three sasquatch in the same area back in March of 2006. This report and link to hear the wood knocks I recorded can be accessed by clicking the link above for Report 21977.",

Had a very good look at a long reddish haired bigfoot standing up right on the back side of concrete barrier, long reddish brown hair. Couldn\u0092t get a height since it was on other side of barrier. Saw the head and both arms on the barrier. Have very bright headlights on truck so got a good look. I am an avid hunter and outdoorsman. It did not have a pointy face. Eyes pointing forward. Saw it for about 5 to 10 seconds. It moved to my left extremely fast and was gone.",
