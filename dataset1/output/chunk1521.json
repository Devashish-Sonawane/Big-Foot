We stepped aside to let some fellow hikers walk through and I happened to notice on the other side of the trail (off the trail) an almost perfectly shaped large footprint. I showed my husband and we were stunned. We took the time to take some pictures and continue on. About 15-20 up the trail was a small tree that was broken in half and bent down. It appeared to be a fresh break and considering it was so close to the footprint we thought it was odd.",

Photos of the track taken by the couple:A cast was made for further examination. On-site casting photo:Photo of the cast:Measurements are as follows:Length 15.5Ball: 7.5Heel: 4.5The following can be added to this report:  The trail this print was found along is located in Rockbridge State Nature Preserve in Hocking County, a light traffic preserve.  The path parallels a formerly used trail before maintenance and upkeep warranted a new one. Walking from the parking lot, a gentle draw is located on the right, and an active cow pasture is immediately to the left. The terrain rises entering the park before sloping down to meet the Hocking River to the east. The forest is mainly deciduous with oaks, beech, and maple trees. The draw has seasonal water. Inside the park is a small year round stream that runs into the Hocking. The broken tree (a native dogwood) was observed, approximately 20ft further along the trail, on the right. The break appeared to be the result of human activity, as the branch measured 5.5ft high, and contoured over the path. Adjacent areas were walked, however no further evidence was noted.This area has a history of recent activity with a possible single track found, see Report 57774, 6 weeks earlier. Nearby: The Hocking River lies to the east, running north-south.Small streams noted nearby. Mixed hardwood forests and small agriculture make up the area. Left of the trail is an adjacent cattle pasture, with both cows and bulls present. SR 33 lies to the west. Lake Logan lies further to the southwest. Clearcreek is to the northwest.",
