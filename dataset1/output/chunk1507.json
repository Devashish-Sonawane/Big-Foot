            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by telephone.In summary:- The animal was close to nine feet tall.- The animal was very big and very muscular.- The animal was as wide as a gorilla. - The hair color was orange-ish, copper-tone.- The witness was unable to see the face. It was difficult for the witness to be precise about the exact location. He had noticed the Zoo Woods sign while driving north on 1st Avenue (IL-171). He had the sighting within about a mile of that sign. He also was sure that it was south of Cermak Rd. There are also many municipalities in this area, so it is difficult to ascertain which jurisdiction he was in when the sighting took place. According to the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, Illinois website, the forest preserves contain over 67,800 acres. Although the forests appear to be a patchwork most of them are interconnected by wooded creeks. As in another recent report from this area , Report # 28525  it is apparent that animals are able to travel corridors from one wooded area to another in this large network of county forest preserves. The area does have a large population so I reviewed a satellite map (see below). The area of the sighting location is (circled in red). ",

            "Observed": "My roomate and I were moving from Austin,Tx to Olympia,Wa. We left Austin at 8:30 am and headed west driving straight through the night. Honestly it was a long day of driving which is what makes this story interesting. We were both on about six red bulls to stay alert for the long nights drive and all seemed normal. About 40 miles north of Phoenix I went around a corner and saw what I thought was a bigfoot standing motionless on the side of the road. This was a highway that had many large rocks that could look like the creature if you were tired enough however this large object had eyes that reflected off my head lights. The creature was a light brown color much like the sand and rocks it was standing around. I didn't want my roomate to make fun of me or think I was crazy so I said nothing about my sighting and continued on for about another hour until we stopped in Kingman and bunked down for the night. Once we checked into the hotel we tried falling asleep but after drinking that much red bull neither of us could fall asleep. As we continued to try and sleep we discussed what a long day it was and my roomate remarked I was so tired I thought I saw bigfoot. He described the same location as my sighting. I rarely speak to anyone about this incident do to the fact that they think I am making it up but I know what I saw and I was not the only one. Bigfoot is indeed real.",
