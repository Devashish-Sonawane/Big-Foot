Its neck was virtually nonexistent.\" \"I guess I knew it was hairy because of the texture and the length of its arm hair...probably 12 inches in length above the elbows.\" \"It was a full moon, however I could only guess about it being  \"dark\" colored.\"\"Also its face had hair around the cheekbones.\" \"Even though it was so far away it was pretty clear and bright with the snow and a full moon.\" \"It didnt look at me like a deer would, more like it was waiting for my reaction to determine its. I almost got the impression it was going to \"say\" something.\" \"I can say that you would have to have seen this thing to know why I knew it wasn't just another one of nature's   \"programmed\" animals.\" \"I had very sharp eyesight at that time, and I was used to stalking deer and other game animals.\" \"I have always wondered what it would have done if it had caught me?....or actually why it chose not to catch me...no doubt it could have easily caught me.\" \"I wish I would have told someone back then...It had to have left some very good prints!\" \"I have read many other reports, and I can tell you I WAS scared and still TO THIS DAY am scared over this thing.\" \"Obviously these things must be relatively docile, because there is no doubt in my mind that it was big enough to have carried me off or hurt me.\" \"I understand about having a weapon with you, and not even thinking about using it....I really dont think I would shoot one. Why?......It was so \"human like\" in the way it made eye contact with me...and yes you can make eye contact at 100 yards.\"",
