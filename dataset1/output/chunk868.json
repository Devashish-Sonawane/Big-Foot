            "Follow-Up Report": "This investigator interviewed the witness extensively on 09/17/07 for approximately 50 minutes. At the time of the incident, about 1.6 years ago, he was 16 years old, and his brother, the other witness, was 14. Their younger sister was also with them. The following account is based on his recollections during the interview, combined with his original report.-They came around a corner onto a trail and saw a large black thing in the middle of the trail; approximately 100 yards ahead of them, and the witness thought initially that it was another person on an ATV. -They continued their approach, and when they reached a distance of approximately 40 yards, the witness realized that he was looking at an upright human-like figure, standing at an angle from their approach, looking in their direction, but with its body facing the woods to their right. -The sighting lasted approximately 20-30 seconds.-The witness described the figure as about 7' tall, and when asked the approximate weight, he stated that the creature was of about the physical proportion of Shaquille O'Neal, the professional basketball player. He also stated that the creature had significant bulk or mass, and was not at all skinny. -He stated that due to the angle of the figure, he could not accurately predict the shoulder width. -He described the figure as covered with brownish-black hair of about 3\"-4\" in length, which was bunched together.-He described the head as oval in shape, and the face distinguishable as \"mannish, not like an ape face\", the color of which was indistinguishable from the fur color. -As they continued their approach, at the distance of about 40 yards, the creature turned and \"casually jogged\" into the trees to their right.-He described the creature's gait as hunched, with the arms hanging down low, not pumping like a human's arms in running, but \"hanging lose\" as it ran.-He described no recollection of smell, in that both witnesses were wearing helmets.-Upon reaching the site of the creature entering the woods, the two brothers stopped, dismounted their ATVs, turned them off, and excitedly discussed the incident. They noticed about 4 visible footprints in the sand of about 17\"-18\" in length, about 4' apart. Great lengths were taken by this investigator to try to accurately portray his recollection of the size of the prints and the length of the stride, yielding the above figures. Because they were in sand, they showed no distinct toes, but the length of the tracks was distinguishable.-The habitat was describes as mostly pine trees, with underlying cover, which this investigator would identify as pine flat woods.On 09/23/07 I interviewed the second witness. He confirmed that the initial sighting was \"about a football field away\" and as they grew closer, he saw the creature in better detail. He described the creature as \"7' tall or taller\", covered with medium length brownish-black hair. This investigator found both these witnesses to be entirely credible; particularly the first witness, in his attempt to accurately portray the size of the prints. The witnesses expressed an increased interest in the phenomenon, and have been on BFRO.net numerous times since their sighting. It is the opinion of this investigator that these two witnesses likely saw a Bigfoot creature.",

            "Observed": "I climbed out of my deer stand at about 9:30 because we had to look for a deer my cousin had shot late the evening before that we could not find because of the thick brush and darkness. Well I cut thru the brush, down across the creek and got about 200-300 yards from my cousin's stand when I heard my Uncle yell something at me. I couldn't hear what he said so I yelled back for him to keep talking so I could get his direction. I got about 100 yard from him. I couldn't see him yet but I could hear him. He said there's a gorilla over here in the tree looking at me. I told him he was crazy. He said there really is, come and look. So when I got to him he said it again. I asked him was he drinking in his stand. He said no come around here and look. So we walked from down below my cousin's stand around to the side of it in the oat patch. I looked up in the tree he showed me with my binoculars and I saw something but I couldn't tell what it was because my binoculars are small and one side is kind of messed up. So I used my rifle scope. At between 100-150 yards away I had my cross hairs right on its chest. It had orange-brown hair all over its body except around its eyes and mouth area. It stood straight up in the fork of the tree with it arms down to its side. It didn't look like a gorilla. It was about 6ft tall but it was hard to tell [for sure] at that distance. I told my Uncle let's walk over there and see what it does. So we got about 75 yards from it and I looked down and then back up and it was gone. We walked over by the tree that it was in and the only tracks I found was where something landed real heavy on its heels and seemed to walk heavy on the heels. The smell was the worst the I ever smelled. We looked down through the woods to a line of oak trees and saw two figures in the trees about 300yards out moving around.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked with both witnesses separately and at length about this particular sighting. The men may well have seen juvenile sasquatches in the tree. The nephew told me that what he saw reminded him somewhat of an orangutan, but also seemed human-like. The uncle stated that just prior to the nephew arriving at his deer stand, there had been another creature in the tree that was somewhat smaller than the one the nephew saw. Both creatures were reddish-brown in color with dark skin and long hair.Once the nephew joined his uncle, both men watched the one animal through rifle scopes for minutes while it stood in the tree seemingly staring right at them. The nephew described the one animal\u0092s face as being \u0093like an old man.\u0094 The animal seemed to have a height of five or six feet, and the other one seen only by the uncle was shorter, perhaps only four feet in height. Both animals were bipedal, and did not give any indications of quadrupedal locomotion. The uncle stated that he saw the hands and feet of the animals and described both as being \u0093kinda like a human\u0092s.\u0094 The men expressed surprise that the animals were in the trees and were small.The men told me that what they saw is not something they are inclined to talk about because \u0093people will laugh and think you\u0092re crazy.\u0094 It is for this reason that the uncle has never reported anything that has happened to him in the past, even though over the last four years, he has come to expect having some sort of encounter on the property. The uncle has hunted the property for ten years, but only the last four years has he experienced unusual circumstances. In the past, his deer stands were turned over, and totally destroyed by some unseen and unknown vandal, though he believes the creatures perpetrated the act. He said he has found large human-like tracks on several occasions through the years. Once, he found a peculiar set of three-toed tracks. All other tracks that he has seen had five toes. The uncle mentioned that he may have seen a larger, black-colored animal from a distance a few years ago. The sighting was fleeting and at the time, he thought he may have seen a bear, but now, he thinks it may have been a large sasquatch.The uncle also told of one incident when his granddaughter accompanied him on the property but stayed in the truck while he tended to the property. When he returned to the truck, the granddaughter told him that \u0093a monkey\u0094 had peered at her through the window of the truck. The property is approximately two miles from the Panola County line and the closest rivers are the Sabine and the Angelina. The men have put cameras out in an attempt to gain photos of the animals. I have been invited to the property. I will post updates as warranted.   ",
