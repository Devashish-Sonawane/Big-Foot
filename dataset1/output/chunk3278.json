            "Follow-Up Report": "I phoned R.L. who currently works in Springfield. While working for the Willamette Natl Forest a few years ago, he became well acquainted with the upper McKenzie River watershed, Mount Washington and Three Sisters Wilderness Areas. Since I also know the area, it is relatively easy to determine his topographical knowledge of the region. R.L. is early 50's, a woodsman/forester, who enjoys cross-country trekking through wilderness using a compass, and not using established or mapped trails.  After talking with R.L. for some 30 minutes and based on the witness' descriptions, it is my view that his report describes a real sighting. R.L. does not want to involve the press in this incident. He seems to be a cautious person.Following are highlights from my notes during our conversation this evening: I asked R.L. to describe what he saw of the animal. He had hiked over Boulder Creek ridge from the road and broken into the high lakes country of the Mount Washington Wilderness. The wind was apparently blowing from the east across his path toward the west in the middle of a cloudy day.  On this wind he smelled a bad odor that really caught his attention. Stopped and looked around up-wind, and there some 20 feet away stood an eight-foot upright creature in about 4 ft of brush against the edge of a darker fir forest. He said the creature was too close for comfort. R.L. described the animal as having huge wide shoulders, long arms, covered all over with 4 to 6 inch long reddish-brown dark hair. Emphasized dark almost black coloration with reddish highlights. The face appeared dark, eyes not really seen but appeared dark and covered with the long hair. R.L. referred to drawings he had seen of prehistoric man, saying the creature looked similar only with a bigger chest and shoulders completely covered with the long hair. Again emphasized the idea of long hair covering the entire body, head, limbs not a furry or soft appearance. As soon as R.L. turned his head and body to look more closely, the animal turned while looking at him and bolted over a small hill covered by lava pumice soil and stone disappearing into forest and understory cover. The entire viewing encounter happened in less than 5 seconds. I asked if he could have taken a photo. He said cameras were not something he carried while trekking. Usually carried only a knife, compass, and water bottle. The encounter was very quick. The creature disappeared in a couple of quick strides. Because of the pungent dead smell and startled viewing, R.L. became frightened. He said, \"The animal went east, I went west leaving the area making my way back to my truck.\"  I asked R.L. if he is interested in returning to the area. He said not alone but agreed to go with me sometime soon to look for sign and possibly see the creature again. He does need coaxing. I explained the value of hard evidence such as photos, recordings, accurate descriptions. Asked him to make a series of simple notes for everything he can remember and do it soon, since it has already been over a week. I asked if he knew of other recent sightings in the Pacific Northwest. Quizzed him a little, he apparently knew nothing of the Oregon Caves or Hoh Reservation incidents recently reported in the press. Other responses to me indicated that he was not previously aware of the BFRO web site until he looked up bigfoot information on the web following his encounter. _______________Originally uploaded to the BFRO Database by: Jeff Lemley  ",

At my 2nd hard look I was looking to see the background to gauge the size of this person. the thing I notice was it was very black ,had no hunter's orange on.{ in the Nat. Forest you must wear an orange vest and hat}it was white from the ground up on each leg about 12\" to 20\" up both legs. It was about 60 to 80 yards from me only seen it take about 8 or 9 step's in open woods, it walked behind a falling tree was going to rise my gun to get a better look when it came in to the next opening. It never came out of the brush. I then left.the more i thought about it i had to go see how big was the trees it was walking by. went back the next day i would say to was 9 to 10 feet tall. long legs and arms. i found no foot prints or anything.the ground is very hard we have had no rain.Heard . it was very strange.",
