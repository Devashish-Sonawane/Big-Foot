            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with Steve on the phone, on the 11th of July 06. He attempted to mimic the sounds he heard.  His rendition of the growls does not sound like something beyond the repertoire of bears sounds, but Steve believes it was much larger than a bear because of the very low pitch.  [Editor Comments below]For years, bigfoot researchers in Southern California have mentioned incidents from this mountainous area between greater Los Angeles area and the Mojave desert.  Some of the stories date back more than a century. The majority of the reports are second-hand, or were published in the 1970's and 60's.  There have not been any Class A sightings from these mountains for at least ten years. That does not mean that some are not still around. It might mean that they are in a different valley than the valleys with the trails. The San Gabriel Wilderness is 36,000 acres, but has only 3 trails: Bear Creek Trail, Mt. Waterman Trail, and Devil's Canyon Trail. The terrain is very steep alpine forest with granite outcroppings.Much of this wilderness area is high above the smog layer of the Los Angeles basin. Although it is subject to high winds, lighting, and freak cloudbursts, and snow in the winter, it is one of the few places in Southern California where water is ALWAYS flowing from clean, mineralized spring sources.Civilization has been steadily filling in most of the nooks at the base of this mountain range, especially on the coastal side of the range, but relatively few people actually live in the mountains themselves. In most places the terrain is too steep for residential development.",
