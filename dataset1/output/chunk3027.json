            "Follow-Up Report": "My team arrived at the location to meet the witnesses and recount the incident. After multiple reenactments of the incident, we came to the conclusion that the creature in question was over 8 feet tall judging by where it entered the wood line and the known height of a hanging branch that it walked right under when entering the woods. The height of the creature was above our investigator's hand and close to the branch hanging down above. This is exactly where it entered the wood line, see photo: The high grass was actually closer to five feet high where they initially saw the eyes. It appeared to be using the high grass as cover as it retreated cautiously towards the far wood line.My team scoured the woods and did find some interesting tracks in the area, see photo: The terrain was made up of hardwood forest, small creek valleys, a large lake, and plenty of thickets for animals to hide. There was also plenty evidence of deer, wild turkey, raccoon, and possum in the area. There was no established trail system in the area as we just meandered through the forest. The Black River is nearby. They described the creature as 8 feet tall, very broad shouldered, green eyes, and a dark black in color. The incident definitely startled these witnesses. They all have backgrounds in the outdoors and are all avid hunters & fisherman. The area will be continued to be monitored. There have been more sightings in and around this area for over 20 years now.I would like to thank Coyote, Sonya Horstman, and Dave Miller for their assistance in this investigation.   ",

I walked closer to see what it was and there was a creature about seven to eight feet tall standing and it was staring me down. I thought it was going to attack me. I was frozen with fear. It just stood there so I started to walk in the other direction when it let out a screeching howl. I stopped and my heart was racing and I couldn't breath. I turned back around and it was about 20 feet from me. I got the idea to slowly put my gun on the ground to show I wasn't going to mean it harm. The creature started to walk towards me so I stood very still. It looked at me with big brown eyes. It started to walk away and I tried to follow but it started running too fast.",
