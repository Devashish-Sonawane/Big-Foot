            "Follow-Up Report": "I met the witness at a nearby service station.  We talked about the sighting as we drove to the scene.  What the witness reported seeing was a large, bipedal creature. It ran down the embankment on the south side of Hwy 105. It then crossed the road in three strides, and went into the brush on the north side of the road. The creature was going towards the bay.  The south side embankment was about 30 feet high.  While there are no trees on the embankment, it is covered in brush about six feet tall. Since the incident occurred during the winter, there would not have been any leaves. The tangle of brush would have been quite difficult for a human to get through. At the top of the embankment, there are power lines, and then the large trees start. At the time, this south side area was covered in mature timber. Since that time, there was a severe wind storm in November 2007, and most of the trees were flattened. They have since been salvage-logged.  The north side of the road is very brushy, with hardwood trees, and a few large fir trees. There is a railroad grade about 50 feet back, and parallel to the highway. The bay is only about 200 feet further.  We have had other reports from he region where large, bipedal creatures are seen going to and from the bay. Since it was completely dark, the lights from the prison complex (about a half mile to the west) would have made it possible to see a person, deer, elk, or large creature cross the road, silhouetted.  This is the approximate position where the witness saw the creature cross the road. It crossed near where the vehicle is parked.This is where the creature came down the bank.This is where the creature left the road heading towards the bay.Her description of the way the creature crossed the highway in three strides, the speed, and the thickness of the brush would make it impossible for this to be a human.  The only large, bipedal creature that could cross the road in such a way would be a sasquatch. ",
