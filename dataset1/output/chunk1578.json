            "Follow-Up Report": "** This investigation was handled by S.P. of Ohio **I spoke to the witness by phone for about one hour. From this conversation I can add the following items:-The first creature was seen at a distance of approximately 100 yards through field glasses. He stated that it was standing just inside the tree line on the other side of a field in the shadows, It appeared dark and he could not make out any facial features or ears. He added that the fence along the edge of the field just about reached the waist of what he observed (the usual Ohio farm fence is at least 4 feet and up to about 5 feet tall).  -The second incident of the hand coming out from the bushes was at a distance of 30 yards and was again observed through binoculars. - The witness had not talked about the incident at all for a number of years. About two years ago he was out camping and trading ghost stories and decided to tell this real life scary story.  He has still not returned to the property and has no interest in doing so. One could tell he was becoming agitated even as he related the event.- The witness had gone to the property to get his truck.  His friend had told him that they had been having some problems with a bigfoot around the farm, but he was totally skeptical of that story. Up until he actually spotted the creature standing in the tree line, he thought his friend was trying to pull a big practical joke on him.- The witness knew that his friend had moved off the property but he sometimes saw his wife at a local establishment where she worked. A few days later, he provided me with an email giving the friend's phone number, which was unlisted, and stated the wife was willing to speak with me about the incident.On another call I spoke with both the friend and his wife. They were initially very reluctant to discuss the situation but eventually confirmed the events that the witness described had occurred. They also provided me with the names of her parents, and I was able to visit the Champaign County library and confirm that they lived there during the time of the incident. They also related some other incidents that had occurred on the property. The investigation continues with the goal of making contact with the mother-in-law and current residents of the property in the unlikely case activity continues.",

            "Observed": "Wednesday, October, 12, 2005 our neighbors dogs were very active and barking all night.  The next morning about 5:30am my own dog was barking in the backyard.  I opened the door to calm her down and I heard something in the back of our property near the fruit trees.  It was very heavy sounding and I could hear branches breaking as it departed.  The next morning around 8:30am my husband went to his truck in the backyard and heard something behind our shop take off running.  He thought it was a hunter and ran to the back to listen.  He thought it sounded like it was on two feet.  He said it stomped very heavily as it was running through the woods and he could hear snorting.  Sunday, October 16th, I went walking around the neighborhood road and discovered several sets of large and small barefootprints on the gray slate road in front of our house.  At first I thought it was a childs footprint until I looked closer.  There were two sets.  The largest measured 13.5 by 7 inches and the small print measured 9 by 4 inches. I took pictures of all the prints and measured each print.  They consistenly measured the same size.  The large print is about 3 inches wider than my husbands foot and he's a big man.",
