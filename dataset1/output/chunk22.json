Although the road is right next to the property, the property sits about 30\u0092 below it in river bottom.  There is a creek at the north end of the property, about 200 feet from where our rig was parked.  That creek runs out to another creek that is part of the river and creates an island that used to be part of the property.  It is very secluded.",
