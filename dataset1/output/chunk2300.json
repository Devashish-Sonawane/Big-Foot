            "Observed": "September 1977, I was ten years old.  My Aunt, my cousin and myself were out in the woods behind my Grandmas house.  We had been working on building a cabin all summer, just for fun.  We would often pack a picnic lunch and spend the day out in the woods.  I heard a noise, like snapping twigs, I turned around and saw in the distance a glimpse of a figure running that appeared light brown in color.  I first thought that it was one of my other cousins coming back to help and then dismissed it from my mind and continued on with the work.  Later that day when we went back up to Grandma's house I then discovered that it could not have been my other cousin, because he had a blue shirt on, not a light brown one.",
