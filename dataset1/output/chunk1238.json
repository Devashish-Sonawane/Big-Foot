            "Follow-Up Report": "I made initial contact with this witness (LC) over the phone. He re-told me of the activity they were experiencing and what he, his mother (PC), girlfriend (J) and neighbor (FP) were hearing. We agreed to meet the following Sunday where I could see the property, talk with them and the neighbor first hand, and look around the property and surrounding forest. Upon arriving and being introduced to PC and J, the reporting witness LC gave me a tour of their very nice home. What I noted is that the layout of the home puts two of the bedrooms and one bathroom in view from the forest. The slope of the terrain is such that anything in the forest-line can see into the bedrooms and bathroom, as well as part of the living area. This would be an attraction to any creatures who wanted to observe the people living there.I talked with the reporting witness, LC and his mother PC about what they heard, which is stated in the witnesses report. We then went into the backyard area and he showed me the kinds of rocks that had been thrown into the yard. We also noted a large tree-limb that had only the day before, fallen from an alder tree that was where the rocks had been thrown. This limb had leaves on it, so it was not a dead limb. It was about 4\u0094 in diameter at its largest end. LC and PC said that there had been no wind that they could remember and this seemed suspicious to them. The distance from the tree line to he back of the house is only about 30 yards. At one point, the forest comes to within 20 feet of the NW corner of the house. This is closest to where PC resides. LC and I examined the forest behind his home. There is nothing to the north behind his home for 30 miles. We found numerous trails that were being used by deer, elk, bear and something else. I found a couple of impressions that were shaped like large footprints, but due to the type of forest duff and vegetation, were inconclusive. One thing to note was a trail which leading to a spot where the home could be observed, while providing cover to the observer. This trail dead-ended in a mashed-down spot about 20 yards into the forest from the backyard. This is typical of what I have seen at other habituation sites where the residents are being observed.Upon returning to the home, LC and his girlfriend, J and I talked about the reported events from both of their perspectives and also what other types of activity they have experienced. I asked him how it felt when the creature screamed at him when he was unloading his hockey equipment. He said that he could feel it resonate in his body. He said that it felt like the non-lethal acoustic weapons that he had worked with in the military. He got the strong feeling that it wanted him to go away. LC said that during the April-May time period, when he would go outside to work that he felt a strong feeling of being watched. He said that this was just like when he was in Iraq and Afghanistan and they were about to be ambushed. He pays attention to such things because of that. He said that since then, he has not had that feeling. I asked him to let me know when he started to feel that again, as the sasquatches could be expected to be returning to the lowlands in the fall.We then went next door to talk with FP. FP has lived there for 32 years. FP described the same incident as PC, and said that he called her to ask if she was hearing the same thing. While talking with FP, he related an account of seeing a sasquatch the very day he moved to Ashford. He was passing through Packwood, and had just left the town limits when a sasquatch walked across the road in front of him only about 60 yards away. He said it looked like a very big, hair-covered man. The hair was brown and long. The posture was bent forward at the waist slightly. The forehead was flat, sloping back to a more pointed shape than a human. It crossed the road in just a couple of steps.I found the reported whispering from the forest to be a compelling detail. This is also commonly reported by people who live in such rural areas where the creatures can observe humans and discuss that between themselves.This image shows the area from which the creature screamed and where the rocks landed.The activity described in the report is typical of sasquatch behavior. I have seen the same thing reported at other locations. I believe that these people are reporting sasquatch activity, and is not a case of the mistaken identity of some other animal.",
