            "Follow-Up Report": "I spent a day this spring (2004) with the witness, hiking through the woods where the sighting took place and surrounding areas, which have generally been logged, although there were a lot of low-lying pristine woods (too wet for logging and where this sighting occurred) and also vast swamp lands. All of it holds a lot of game (white tailed deer, bear, snowshoe hare, grouse, etc.) and of course the logged land is at various stages of re-growth and helps provide sustenance to wildlife. The witness is a professional hunting and fishing guide and is a very nice fellow. He lives close to the wild land and derives his livelihood from the wild creatures there in north central Wisconsin, where he grew up and has always hunted and fished. This is the second sighting he has had. The other was about two years earlier Report #5507 and about two miles from the \u0093following\u0094 incident he reports here. This picture is of the first sighting location; it shows the fire lane where the witness reported seeing the animal fidgeting (my word) and the body of water it jumped across in a single bound. When I asked about it, he told me that before the 2002 sighting he never saw or heard anything unusual around there, that he was shocked to discover such a creature.In telling about this more recent sighting, the witness described a sort of cat and mouse game he played with the creature he came to realize was there, and following him: At first he was alarmed to realize a big animal was near, and that it almost seemed to be stalking him, way out there in the woods and vulnerable to attack\u0085 but it didn\u0092t attack, and he realized the thing was what he\u0092d seen a couple of years before \u0096 a creature that had run off upon seeing him \u0096 and that it wasn\u0092t going to come after him, that the animal was apparently harmless\u0085 curious about him.So he relaxed, and then he became curious, and began carefully observing the creature himself. He adopted a non-threatening manner: Instead of looking directly at the animal, he watched it out of the corners of his eyes. It seemed to try to avoid being seen by him; it peeked around the shadow side of tree trunks to watch him. He behaved casually, as though he was about some benign business; strolling, foraging \u0096 not out for blood. (This was actually true. The witness was unarmed and out for one of his nosing around hikes \u0096 scouting the deer situation, just being in and observing the activities of \u0093his\u0094 woods.) And the creature seemed to fall for it; the witness saw it go to the places where he dwelled and display mock interest in plants near the ground; it appeared to inspect those places for what had interested the witness. I\u0092m not sure who was the cat and who the mouse in this game!And at one point, from behind the up-turned root system of a large tree just 30 or so yards away, it peered through at him and he got a pretty good look at its face: he said it had a broad, fairly flat nose, but not upturned; the eyes were deep set, and he could see some skin on the face, which he described as battleship- or gun metal-gray. But because the woods there are so thick (see above photo) and the creature was careful about being seen, he saw only parts of it, never the entire animal at once. But he could see that it was large, covered with hair, and that it walked upright on two legs. The witness gave me a \u0093play-by-play\u0094 tour of the route he hiked as the creature he described followed along, showing each place where it stood, behind which trees and so forth. He really knew those woods \u0096 every tree, it seemed. We found a recently-vacated bear den with a good-sized bear track on the heap of dirt at the den\u0092s entrance, saw beautiful cedar trees, lots of ruffed grouse and deer sign, and I saw a lot of country where a sasquatch could make a living. We also found an odd man-like track on the soft edge of a very low-use gravel road through the area.It was quite an interesting track (see photos above): It appeared to be a couple of weeks old and it was clearly made during very wet conditions, as if it were raining or had just been raining (note that my nearby boot print barely marks the surface despite significant rain the day before). The track was longer than my size 12 booted foot; it appeared not to have been made by a booted foot: although individual toe impressions could not be discerned, all edges were soft, and there were no indications of a boot heel. It was a single, deeply-impressed track that gave the impression of having been made in a leaping step, probably at a run, as if its maker angled off from the hard-packed driving surface onto the soft shoulder and launched itself off into the ditch and then into the bush, which lined the road on both sides. We could find no other such tracks up or down the road or the ditches, which did have some good places for taking tracks.Aside from its non-human look (seemingly shoeless and very large), the track was striking for how it appeared to have been made: with a lot of downward force, especially of the type created by running, and in its being isolated, suggesting that what made it went off the road there, into the cover. It seems an unlikely thing for a person to do. The witness, a man who knows tracking, was also perplexed and intrigued by the track.It was evident to me that the witness is a skilled outdoorsman, and he convinced me that in the last couple of years he has twice seen an animal that fits the description of a sasquatch. The behavior of the thing \u0096 following him, showing apparent curiosity over his activities, and taking precautions against being seen \u0096 provides some insight into such an animal\u0092s mind.",
