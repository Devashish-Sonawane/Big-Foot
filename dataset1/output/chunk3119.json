I looked up on the hill to my right and I saw the silhouette of what looked like a man standing in the scrub-brush. Now I've hunted this scrub brush many many times and very rarely could I see over the top of it. What I saw was what looked like a man standing in the brush with his top half protruding above the top of the brush. This as you may have guessed scared the hell out of me. Ironically I think it was just as scared as I was, because at just about the same time we both took off in opposite directions.",
