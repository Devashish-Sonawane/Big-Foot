On this trip I would have 2 encounters that are up to discussion as to what they were. Let me just start by saying I'm recently a believer in Bigfoot. For several months I've been reading the case histories on the BFRO website, and frankly, I knew that the areas I'd be riding in were prime Bigfoot country. Let me also add that I had no desire to have any kind of Bigfoot encounter because I'm on a bike, I'm alone, I carry no weapon for defense, I'm often camping miles from anywhere, and I scare easily.",
