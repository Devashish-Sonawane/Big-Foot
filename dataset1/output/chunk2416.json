            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke for quite some time with the witness by phone.   He started out by telling me about his encounter while shining deer.  He and his ex-wife and child were driving and shining for deer in open farm fields.   He stated that there would normally be anywhere from 75 to 100 deer in the fields at night.  On this night there were no deer seen.  He hit the two animals mentioned with the million candle power spotlight. The two creatures were described as absolutely massive and very tall with one being around 7 ft and the other being 8 1/2 to 9 ft tall.   The eyes reflected a very bright red and the witness could see the animals blinking.  They never moved, just stood side by side and watched the vehicle.  Their coloration was jet black.  After a few minutes the witness got a strange feeling and felt they must leave and did so.  The animals were not all the way across the field,  but he could still not make out details such as hair length, facial details or muscle tone.  ",

Because of the short duration of the sighting, it will be classified as a Class B report.    A brief sighting length of no more than five seconds was reported by the witness.  The idea that someone would be fishing during the summer in a fur coat and the width of the shoulders left a strong impression on the witness.  This observation also eliminates most of the everyday explanations for what the witness observed.  The daughter of the witness, who was riding in the vehicle, did confirm her father's comments related earlier.The issue of why the witness and daughter would travel so far for church was discussed and resolved to this investigator's satisfaction.The location of this sighting was at the edge of the Miami River valley.  Extending to the north is a string of parks and preserves.  The Miami has actually cut an impressive gorge to the north of this location.  Of particular interest is a comment report also submitted to the BFRO that related the discovery of a foul smelling large nest-like area in one of the parks north of the sighting location in the Miami valley earlier in the same summer.",
