I also reported this to the Western New York bigfoot association and contacted back and forth with thier director Mike George. He was suppose to come down and meet me so that i could take him out to the location this vocalization occurred , unfortunatley he never made it down. This happened to myself and my long time friend and hunting partner back in winter of 2001.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on 1/21/05.  He provided the following additional information:- The incident occurred off route 38 not route 36 as noted in the report.- Unable to determine an exact date.  It was during grouse season and could have been late Dec. 2000 or early Jan 2001.  Note: grouse season for this part of NYS runs from Oct 1 - Feb 28 (reference 2004/05 hunting rules/regs).- There was a dog at a near by farm house that barked the entire time they were hunting.  In retrospect, the witness feels the dog was actually barking at something in the general area.  - That afternoon the area was oddly devoid of wildlife; normally the area is a great hunting spot.- The witness and his friend started hunting at noon and heard the first vocalization at 4:00 p.m; it lasted no more than 10 seconds.  A total of 3 or 4 vocals were heard over a 5-7 minute span.  The source of the vocals was very close, perhaps 30 yards.  The witness stated, \"You could feel it, it was so powerful.\"",

The witness identified where he had seen one of the rocks coming through the trees. Due to an overhanging branch and the slope on the hillside, the distance a rock could have been thrown was between 20 to 30 yards. The witness stated the screams went from a low growl to a deafening, deep scream. From the railroad tracks he heard at least three screams from two different locations. The boy's father did accompany us to the location and said there have been many sightings in the area. Unfortunately, most people are afraid to talk about it.",
