            "Observed": "I was headed south in a delivery truck when my eye caught movement on the right side of the road maybe 200 yards ahead. The creature had been standing motionless at the side of the road. It was facing the road then it spun around counter clockwise and in less than 3 steps was gone back into the timber with its arms swinging as it stepped. I saw him for 2.5 seconds. It was solid black or dark brown. It was very large with huge shoulders. I think he was standing there looking to see if it was safe to cross, then turned around and retreated because of the approaching vehicles.",

            "Other Stories": "There were several very credible sightings that made the local news in Grays Harbor Co. 7 to 8 years before my sighting that are posted on this web site. Also my late brother said that he and his wife narrowly missed hitting one crossing the Wishkah Rd. out of Aberdeen in the early to mid 80\u0092s. His wife said they could see the long hair hanging from its arm like the fringe on a leather jacket. I saw another story on this web site or another about a sighting by a lady 3 miles south of my sighting on the same Hwy 101. She was on her way to Klalock from I think Yakima to meet up with her family. It crossed the road in front of her at a much closer distance and she saw it for about 8 seconds. This took place around 2001. It\u0092s been a while since I read that story. My Native American freind Randy C. and his brother seen one on the Quinault Indian Reservation which is the same region of my incident.",

He recalls the animal's broad shoulders and chest clearly and says he \"sees it now as he did on that day\" 27 years ago.- I asked if he could estimate the height of the animal. He could not. \u0093It was big\u0094 was all he could add.",
