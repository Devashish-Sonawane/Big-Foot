About 40 feet away from the witness was a swampy area full of tall grass and reeds more than six feet in height.  When the witness first noticed something tall in the reeds, he whistled at it and after about 2 seconds a return whistle, different from the initial whistle, was returned.  After he realized that there wasn't anybody there with him, he shined his light back on the creature, which proceeded to move farther away.  He noticed that the creature stood a little taller than the 6-7 foot tall reeds. The area itself has housing subdivisions in it, but it is located in the Shawnee National Forest.",
