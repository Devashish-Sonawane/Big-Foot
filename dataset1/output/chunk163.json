            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the home owner Tim, the day after the incident.The event was still fresh in his mind, and he was able to provide me with further details.He states that there has been strange activity near his home for the past four years, including weird calls that sound as if something is saying \"Where are you?\" He has also found unusual tracks and fecal matter in the woods by his home.The five men were watching the game on TV when Dan alerted the group that something was walking by the house. They all saw what appeared to be a bipedal creature walking on the pavement from South to North approximately five feet beyond the split rail fence. It was between 5 and 6 feet tall hunched over, and had a very wide build and broad shoulders. It walked under a street light, but due to the angle it was silhouetted and all they could make out was that it was covered in hair. It walked on two legs, and its arms hung down by its sides. The encounter lasted less than 10 seconds, and after the creature walked into the woods the men talked about what they had just seen. None of the witnesses had any prior interest in the topic of Bigfoot, but once Tim told them of some of the other activity he has experienced near his home - the men concluded that it could have been none other than a Bigfoot.His home is located less than a quarter mile from a sand quarry, and just over a half mile away from a vast extent of open spaces, including marshes, pole lines, and deciduous forest. There is plenty of food sources, water, and ground cover to support an individual like what was described.",

When I made the adjustment, something in the bottom of my screen caught my attention. It was moving quickly and it seemed to be grabbing things up from the ground.  It was too dark and it was moving too quickly for the lens to focus. In profile it looked like a person ... a very tall person with really long arms. I couldn\u0092t look away. I was afraid it would disappear.  It continued its path and crossed behind a tree and I lost it.",
