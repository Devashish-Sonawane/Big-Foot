            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a professional behavior analyst and the following additional information was obtained during a 20 minute phone interview.The witness is very familiar with the two-lane state road and specific area in which the sighting took place, having traveled the road numerous times in the past and at the same general time.  The witness was traveling with young children who were asleep in the back seat and she was on her cell phone driving east when the sighting took place.  She observed a dark, bipedal animal move with a relatively fast, steady gait across the road from her right to left as an oncoming, westbound car was approaching in the distance.  Her car passed the animal after it had stepped over the guardrail adjacent to the westbound lane and observed the animal take a few steps down an embankment and then disappear from sight. She described the animal\u0092s movement in crossing the road and stepping over the guardrail as smooth and fluid.  The approximate distance of the animal from the front of car as it traversed the road was indeterminate, however it was of sufficient distance that she had time to slow down.  As the bipedal animal crossed the road, the witness\u0092s car headlights caught the lower half of the animal\u0092s body, which she described as hairy with no reflected light.  The section of Route 6 on which the sighting took place is relatively flat with swampy, relatively dense woodland on both sides of the road.  This area is very dark at night due to the absence of ambient light from streetlights, nearby homes or businesses along the road.  The general area is marked by low rolling hills and wetlands within relatively large tracts of uninhabited, state protected land.  The sighting took place in the Pawtuxet River watershed which is characterized by deciduous trees and mixed forests coupled with freshwater waterlands.  This biodiverse environment supports a wide range of mammalian (e.g., deer, bobcats, foxes) and waterfowl species.  ",

Area and have heard stories about there. i am an avid outdoorsman, orv and snowmobile operator, an eagle scout, camper and have property in the area and know all the trails from lupton, rose city, mio and mckinley areas. i own a jeep and offer any help i can provide. i will also take you to the three sighting locations i mentioned hear if needed. maybe all four if i can get my cousin to open up more and go back.",

            "Observed": "i had a friend who lived a few miles away. one night when he was out of town his girlfriend at the time and her daughter, called and said that their dog had a seizure and wouldn't let them out of the bedroom. she had called him and he told her to call me. i had a friend at the house at the time and we went over. by the time we got there the dog had calmed and i helped her feed him and lock him in another room. my friend and i decided to go home through the woods. we traveled up to the end of beechwood road and turned to go on hughes lake road. we turned off of that road to go to deckerville road and as we turned a corner my headlghts caught a large dark object \"run\" across the road. it acted as though it was trying to figure out which way we were coming from or it didn't hear us until that instant. it seemed as though it turned from us to the direction it was going into the woods and with just a few long strides it was gone. it was very large, tall and dark brown. i was sitting in an s10 blazer and was looking up at it at a distance of maybe 40 to 50 feet. it took a second for me to gather myself but i asked my friend if he saw that and he said yes. i stopped and began to backup to the spot and he asked me what the hell i was doing. i wanted to see a track or something to help explain this. i thought maybe a bear was standing trying to see where we were coming from and ran off on it's hind legs. the ground was frozen and the s10 didn't even leave tracks. bears usually drop to all fours to run and they have short front legs that don't \"swing\". i thought maybe a deer had been wounded and learned to run upright, but this thing was just too massive. my friend told me you know what it was, even if nobody believes it. i suppose he's right.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On 9/29/09, I spoke with the witness.   He went over his story, and repeated everything as he stated above.   He was impressed with the speed and sheer size of the animal, which he estimated at around 9 feet tall.  He said the entire encounter only lasted a few seconds.  The friend who was with him was quite nervous, as he had an encounter with the same type of animal a few years before. During the previous encounter, he thought that he was looking and talking to a person in a fur coat, until he realized the sheer size and height of the thing, after noting that the branch it was leaning its head on was around 10 feet high.      This occurred in an area where several other sightings have been reported over the last couple of decades. This area is part of the Huron National Forest, with several small lakes and creeks in the area. It is also not far from the Au Sable River valley.   Deer, bear, and many types of small game are plentiful in the area.",
