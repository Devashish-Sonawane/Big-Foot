            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness had been aware of unusual smells near his home for a couple years. His dog at the same time would become fearful. Several times he had heard large footfalls and unusual voices in the woods adjoining his backyard.  After discussing the situation with the witness he agreed to allow me to start a long term recording project in the hopes of picking up these unusual sounds. I checked the recorder several times in the weeks after our first meeting and did record some unusual sounds. Although the sounds were not of good quality they still were of some interest.Listening to the audio recordings the first time I thought it was just humans, but the witness assures me that he had no house guests in the recording time frame and he also has no neighbors near to him.This sound was recorded on the 14th of August 2011:Click here to listen to sound clip:  Sugar Creek Voices This incident was in the same general area as:Sangamon County - Report # 29495  After the recent footprint find and recorded sounds close to the witness' home the audio recording project continues.",
