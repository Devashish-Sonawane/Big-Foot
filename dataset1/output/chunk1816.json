            "Observed": "On October 8, 2014 me and my wife we're out picking  mushrooms, above Wilkeson Washington, 20 miles or so from the base of Mt. Rainer. We parked at a forest service gate and walked in about 1 and a half miles to our spot, Where we have been many times before, its all old growth timber and really thick with old stumps and moss and what not, anyway, when we walked in my wife thought she heard an ax or something pounding on a tree. She said did you hear that? I was excited and finding mushrooms so I blew it off, and said come and pick this patch. An hour or so had passed, when I heard snapping and crunching about 100 yards away or so. And then we both heard thump thump thumping of what we concluded was a big rock pounding against a tree, now mind you, we are in the middle of pretty much nowhere, not a sole around. My wife and I stood in awe, and she said that sounds like wood knocks. My heart sunk as I watch a lot of bigfoot documentaries. I am an avid hunter and no all the sounds a forest or animal makes. Three minutes or so had passed from the tree pounding and crunching when all of a sudden SNAP, a tree or big branch we estimated around 5 or 6 inch in diameter snapped 20 feet behind us. We both jumped.as it was so loud and close.at that moment we ran. I said lets go, heck with the the mushrooms, as we were running past a lot. It was the scariest most unsurreal thing that's ever happened to me. 42 years in the woods and I never. I do not like to tell this story to my friends and stuff.as they laugh. But I know what we seen and experienced. Of all the times the one trip I did not carry my gun. Not that I would of shot.but I would of maybe got a picture or a visual or just felt more secure. Take this to heart, I will never hunt or look at the woods the same as long as I live. They are real whatever they are .THEY ARE REAL! Feel free to call me on this.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After making contact with the witness and his wife by phone we talked for over 45 minutes about their experience. The witness is a middle aged man who is an experienced hunter and is familiar with all manner of local wildlife. After talking with the witness I believe he is being truthful and that he really did experience a frightening threat display, by what he believes was a Bigfoot.The witness and his wife were mushroom picking above Wilkeson in the middle of the day. Before they entered the woods they noticed a Forest Service crew removing and replacing road signs near the area. This included pounding the new poles into the ground. They walked to the site after waiting for the crew to finish. While entering the woods the wife claimed to hear a noise similar to an ax hitting a tree. They started to pick mushrooms and after an hour or so they began to hear branches snapping and the stomping of something on the forest floor about 100 feet away. They also heard what seemed to be a rock being slammed into a tree repeatedly. After what they estimate to be 3-5 minutes later they heard a massive tree snap about 20 feet behind them. The witness is familiar with what is suspected to be bigfoot behavior by watching documentaries and Animal Planet's \"Finding Bigfoot\" on TV. The couple then became extremely frightened and left the area. They have never returned and are extremely hesitant to talk about the incident with friends and family.Due to the circumstance of their encounter and the area in which it happened, I believe the witness and his wife experienced a threat display and a warning to leave the area . This possibly could have been because of a food source being taken out of the area.It is my opinion that the couple had an encounter with one or more bigfoots that day.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness the morning after the sighting and agreed to meet him there that afternoon. After arriving there I talked to the husband and wife about what they witnessed when they came home last night. After being briefed, the wife went inside their house and I had the husband take me through what he experienced.From where the creature crossed the driveway the husband thought it might have been picking up horse chestnuts, an acorn type nut, so we looked for signs around the trees. Not finding anything, we went back to where it crossed the drive way.As they were coming down the driveway, he was paying attention to the edge of the pond, only a couple feet to the left, when his wife, riding in the passenger seat cried out, \"What is that !!\"  As he turned to look, it had aready crossed the driveway and was moving  through the yard towards the pond. He lost sight of it when it went into the tall grass and cattails. I had him place me where he was on the driveway and I had him stand where the creature was when he first saw it. Using my range finder I found the distance to be 16 yards. Not finding any sign in the mowed grass, we appoached the pond. I asked him if he or anyone else had come down to look in this area and he replied to me, no. Nobody had come back to the spot.Approaching the pond, I could see something quite large had gone through there. At first there's about 4ft high grass that goes in about 6ft before the cattails start. The cattails go another 10ft before there is open water in the small pond.There were definite impressions in the grass area, about eight of those other than the matted grass. I could make out what appeared to be finger tips or toe impressions, roughly the size of the thickness of a roll of half dollars, in the mud. After photographing them, I backed out to investigate the trail it made through the grass. Other than matted grass, I could not find any impressions in the ground. The rim around the pond has about 10ft of mowed grass before it reaches the woods. Going into the woods I found nothing out if the ordinary. Coming back to the house, the husband informed on numerous occasions he would see something looking in the windows. His daughter who was visiting at the time saw one watching her, it's face being just below the top of the window. I looked at the area around the windows. The owner had let the rose bushes grow unattended and they are quite thick in both window areas, but you could see where something had worn an area on the ground. The height from the ground to the soffit is 10ft. The top of window is 9ft.I went back to the pond to cast the most castable impression out of the ones there. It was a palm imprint. It appeared to be a left palm. The thumb seemed to be laying flat. The next two fingers were spread but were deep into the mud. The next two fingers were visible but not as pronounced as the others.After removing the cast, the husband called his wife out to look at it.This gave me the opportunity to question the wife on just what she saw. I had her place me on the driveway where she was in the car when she saw it cross. She stood where it crossed and I ranged her at 18 yards. I then had her take me through from where she first saw it untill it crossed the driveway into the yard. She started by the Horse Chestnut trees walking infront of them about 20ft to the driveway and across into the grass. I then had the husband go into the yard where he saw it and hold his arm out at the height it was. While he stood there, I had the wife come down and stand at where she thought the length of it from her husband would be.The measurement I took while they stood there was 5ft tall, 8ft wide. The husband said it was not flat on the ground. He could see it's limbs moving, kind of a jumping.When I was watching the wife earlier take me through it's path, her dog was following her. The dog paused right before the driveway sniffing the ground then moving away. When I looked at where it sniffed, there were indentations in the ground of similar size as by the pond. I was able to cast that impression as well.I spent about four hours at the site and found both the husband and wife very credible on what they saw just 23 hours prior.
