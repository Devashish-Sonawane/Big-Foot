He still remembers the details like it was yesterday and conveys that in his voice as he tells of the experiences. He would like to add that he remembers sitting in his hunting blind on several occasions hearing what he described as a \"crack\" or \"pop\" that seemed to move through the woods. At the time he just chalked it up to being wind noise from the trees, but after learning more about Bigfoots he believes it was either a single Bigfoot or small group moving through the area and locating each other. He said he would hear a single knock, then a bit later another single knock and so on until it was out of earshot.He has invited me to go and check the area out with him the next time he is back in Michigan, which I gladly accepted.The report he was referring to is Report #20202.
