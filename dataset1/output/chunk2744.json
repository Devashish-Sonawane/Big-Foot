            "Observed": "in early june of this year i was riding my four wheeler above jasper colorado , at about 7;00 in the morning, i had stopped to rest at the logging block, when i heard a loud howling noise. there was no wind that day, and i could not focus in on the source. i had seen alot of sheep on Cornwall mountain on the way up so i figured it was a dog  or the sheep hearder, when i had finished my water i was loading everthing back on the bike,when i heard the same sound again, only this time it was much louder. i zeroed in on it and my heart stopped. slightly below my logging road and to my right i observed a very large dirty black man like creature with his hands around an aspen tree,it was leaning a little to the right and staring at me. i stood very still and never took my eyes off of it.after about seven or eight minutes it turned and simply walked off down the hill.i will add that i am a 30 year archery hunter, and have succesfully tagged bears in this same unit. this was no bear. it was large and shaggy looking.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness resides in the Alamosa area, is a farmer and truck driver, lifelong hunter, and former deputy sheriff for Conejos County. His father was a local game warden.The location of this incident was south of Jasper, above the old Shawcroft sawmill, between Cliff Lake and Kerr Lake.According to the witness, after stopping for a break during his ride and sitting there for a few minutes, he heard the first howl which sounded unusual to him but he did not make much of it. He claimed an \"uneasy, creepy feeling\" for about the next five minutes while sitting there. Then he heard another louder howl from the same direction and area. Both howls sounded similar and were described as two-toned, starting in a lower pitch and lasting about two to three seconds in duration.Immediately after the second vocalization, he saw the figure a little downslope below him and at a distance of approximately one hundred yards. He could see its hands around a larger 10\" aspen tree and the upper body leaning out from behind the tree looking straight at him and not moving. The lower body was not visible behind the tree and in brush. He described it as dark-colored with a reddish tinge similar to some bears. Elk damage was apparent on the tree at about five feet in height and the hands were about two feet higher. There was no timber between them and he had a clear and unobstructed view. It was a little too far for any apparent facial details to be visible. He also noted that it was very quiet as there was no wind, bird, insect or animal noise. After a considerable time with both remaining motionless and staring at each other, the witness claimed to be reaching into his backpack to grab a camera that he did have with him when the figure turned and walked off, at which point the witness noted that he was surprised at the width of its shoulders, that it was \"really thick\" and estimated that it was seven feet tall or taller. \"That's what really scared me, it's size,\" and he immediately left the area.David Petti",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a health care professional. While not a long time outdoors person, she has spent the last few years going into her husbands leased hunting preserve with him. She is no longer comfortable going into the woods or into this area even with her husband and myself. Though her husband was in the car, he was in the passenger seat and the angle and the glare on the windshield from the radio dial light prevented him from seeing what she was seeing.The witness is quite sure of what she observed. After marking the trees she indentified with tape, and using her husband as a reference (he is 5'11\"), the witness feels sure that the creature that she saw observing them was 7 feet tall or at least a foot taller than her husband. Photos of the area and the trees where she observed the creature have been taken. The distance from where the witness was in her car to the trees she observed the creature is about 15 meters. While the brush looks thick from the road, the underbrush is quite thin and would allow a fairly large animal to move unobstructed within the tree line. The shape was that of a man but much more bulky and taller. The head appeared to set directly on the shoulders. The witness also recalled a smell similar to rotten eggs during the encounter.The only other item she recalled was the presence of what she thought was reflected moonlight from what appeared to be eyes. She compared the color to that of a dog with cataracts in appearance.This area is within about 1000 meters by direct line from an area that her husband had an encounter and within 1000 meters of a power line cut.I will be trying to bring more BFRO people into this area.",
