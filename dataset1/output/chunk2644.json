            "Observed": "My family owns a home on Chazy Lake in the northeast corner of the Adirondacks.  I spend many weekends there and often wake up early on Monday morning in order to get into work (about 1 hour away).  In February of 2005, I had gotten up and left the house at about 6:30 am.  Approximately 2 miles down the Chazy Lake Road, headed toward the Town of Saranac, is where I had my sighting. A ditch (approximately 3 feet wide and 2 feet deep)runs along side of the road.  There was probably a foot of snow on the ground.  As I was driving, I saw something dark stand up from inside the ditch and head into the woods.  When I saw it, it was probably 150-200 yards in front of me.  It appeared to have a human shape but was slouched over.  I could not tell the height nor could I give an approximate weight.  The sighting lasted probably no more than 5 seconds.  I saw the upper 2/3 of its body which appeared to be dark brown or black in color.  I told my wife about it that night and we joked about it for a bit saying it must have been Bigfoot.  In all honesty, I thought I had either seen or bear or my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I hadn't thought about the sighting for quite some time until I read about a sighting in Clinton County (1998) on this web page and noticed it was in almost the exact same location as my sighting.",

The witness was on the road very early, headed to work.He saw something rise out of a ditch along side a road with no other traffic. It ran off into woods as his headlights began to illuminate it.He initially thought it must have been a person/hunter, because he had the impression that it ran off on two legs.   He also had the impression that the figure was dark brown or black.The figure was approximately 100 yards away when it ran into the woods. ",

When it reached the steep (empty) canal bank it used it's arms like legs, knuckles down, like a quadruped, to swifty climb the embankment.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On 4/22/06 I had a very detailed hour long conversation with this witness (C.H.). When he posted his report he kept it brief, but he provided more details during the interview. It was around 9pm.  His wife was driving.  As they finished rounding a curve, their headlights shown on a fence line about 40' away from the road where the animal was stepping over the wire fence.  C.H., his wife and daugther were all sitting in the front of their SUV. They all saw the animal at the same time.  His wife slowed the vehicle as the animal continued at a swift smooth walk toward the road from their forward left view.  It crossed the road in clear view through the headlight beams at an estimated 30' in front of them.  The animal turned to look at the vehicle. He has since looked at several images on the BFRO site and says the figure was \"like the Patterson subject\" but without the breasts. It was very well built. It had an erect posture and long swinging arms.  The face of this 7' tall plus animal was bordered with hair. The face was basically flat, unlike a gorilla.  It had dark eyes, a prominent brow, a nose with flared nostrils. The mouth was wide and slightly open. The skin on the body that was visible was lighter in color than the fur.  Its head was peaked, but not pointed, with no apparent ears. It had a definite chin and a very thick neck.  He said the coat of fur looked thick and well groomed, with about 1 1/2\" charcoal/gray hair.  It continued off the road to the right approaching a steep embankment then clenched its fists out in front and without bending scaled the 10' high embankment with all four limbs.  It went up and over the embankment and out of sight.  The entire distance of the sighting was around 160' from left to right.  There was a full moon.In the light of the next day C.H. returned to look for the tracks on the embankment. He found the impressions but they were not clear enough to cast.  The knuckles left more obvious marks than the feet but they were still not clear enough to cast.",
