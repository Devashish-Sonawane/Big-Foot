My friend quickly approached the culvert and urged me to join him immediately.  There at the far end of the culvert were 2 ape-like creatures with glowing eyes.  I believe this was my first Bigfoot sighting.  The singing continued, despite our intrusion.  The creatures did not move toward us, and we left in a hurry so as not to disturb them.",

After hearing the diatonic sounds coming from a large culvert the two hikers climbed down to peer through the culvert to see the silhouettes of two creatures crouched or sitting at the far end. These creatures were close together gently swaying and humming (singing) a diatonic type of moan. The culvert with incoming light was too dark to determine facial or body details. Two distinct silhouettes of ape-like animals were seen by both observers before making a hasty retreat. This encounter appears to this investigator to be valid and real. The observation gives a unique insight into interspecific vocal interactions plus the fact that sasquatch spends time within or under human-built structures.",

He was between 7 and 8 feet tall more on the skinny side but still big. Not groomed kind of mangy looking.  Longer than average arms and thick through the shoulders to the top of the neck.  I know what I saw.  I'm 42 now and have been called crazy all my life because I openly admit what I saw.  The sound it made could not be recreated by a person.",
