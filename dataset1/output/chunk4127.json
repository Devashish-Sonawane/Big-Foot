            "Observed.1  ": " The Ledger Published: Wednesday, December 29, 2004 at 2:29 a.m.  If the Green Swamp ape actually does exist, its ears must be burning. Lakeland resident Jennifer Ward went public in November, sharing her description and drawings of a hairy, human-shaped creature she claimed to have seen on the edge of the Green Swamp in August. Ward's tale has reverberated through cyberspace, with links to the original Ledger story and a subsequent Orlando Sentinel article showing up on such sites as Paranormal News, Dr. Mysterian and American Monsters. Ward has drawn attention from groups that probe the existence of unconfirmed creatures, and she has appeared on three radio shows to discuss what she saw. \"I'm not real surprised people are interested in it,\" Ward says. Ward, 30, has discussed her experience with radio hosts at stations in West Palm Beach, Iowa and Jacksonville. She was joined by Scott Marlowe, an instructor with the Winter Haven-based Pangea Institute, which offers classes in archaeology and other areas. The mother of two says disc jockeys at one station treated her story as comedy, and one at the Iowa station questioned her sanity. \"I'd probably think it was real funny, too, if I just heard about it,\" Ward says. \"I just said I can't help what I saw and I can't help what other people think, either.\" Marlowe says the disc jockeys seemed prepared to ridicule Ward but seemed impressed by the obvious sincerity in her voice. \"When Jennifer begins to talk, you can tell she's not fabricating this,\" Marlowe says. Ward was driving along Tom Moore Road north of Lakeland a few days after Hurricane Charley in August when she saw something in a ditch beside the road. She describes a two-legged creature about eight feet tall and covered in dark fur with light rings around its eyes. She says it seemed to be foraging. Ward, who had her two daughters in her car, says she watched the creature for 30 seconds or so before driving on. She examined the scene later but found no conclusive evidence of any beast's presence. Since Ward's story appeared, several neighbors have told her they have seen or heard something strange in the Green Swamp, and she has learned people living along Rock Ridge Road talk about a \"gray ape.\" But none were willing to speak publicly about their experiences. Several readers also contacted The Ledger with descriptions of unfamiliar creatures, though only one agreed to be identified. Carol Gill of Davenport says reading about Ward's experience evoked memories of a night nearly two decades ago when she and her ex-husband were fishing and rabbit hunting at night in northeast Polk County. Driving in their truck, they came across what Gill recalls as a fleshtoned animal about 5 feet long that raced before them at great speed. Gill, 48, says she first thought it was a hog but noticed it loped more like a kangaroo. \"I just freaked out, telling my husband, `Let's leave,' \" Gill recalls. \"He was just trying to maneuver the truck and get a good spotlight n it. . . . It wasn't my imagination or anything.\" Gill says she hasn't told many people about the experience, and her ex-husband now lives out of state. She drew comfort from hearing about Ward's sighting. \"There's somebody else that's seen something too out there,\" Gill says. Ward's claimed sighting has boosted interest in an online cryptozoology class Marlowe is scheduled to teach next semester for Florida Keys Community College. Marlowe says he has received inquiries from as far away as New Jersey and Australia for the course, which will explore rumored or unconfirmed species. Not everyone, though, is encouraging Marlowe's pursuit of what he considers scientific truth. Marlowe says he has received \"hate mail\" both from creationists and evolutionists who question the existence of an unconfirmed species of hominid. The story also has drawn attention from the nation's foremost cryptozoologist, Loren Coleman. The Maine-based author of such books as \"Cryptozoology A to Z\" has discussed the matter with Marlowe and says he hopes to explore the area and interview Ward during a visit next spring. Coleman says creatures identified as skunk apes or swamp apes have been spotted in Florida at least since 1960. He estimates there are 20 legitimate sightings a year, though he says most remain unreported because the witnesses fear ridicule. \"It certainly sounds like it goes within the context of other stories from Florida,\" Coleman says of Ward's claim. \"I find this a credible story. It needs more investigating. I'm hoping the article will bring forth people who are seeing these things because they fail to report them.\" Marlowe prepared a map of swamp ape sightings in Florida since 1982 that shows Polk County among seven counties with three or more observations. He says the map suggests Polk could be the final stop in a southward winter migration for the creature. While Marlowe hopes to conduct an academic survey of the southern Green Swamp some time next year, he says others have been searching the area in a less rigorous way. \"I've noticed the number of people cruising up and down Moore Road seems to be higher,\" Marlowe says. Could the rumor of a swamp ape some day draw people to Polk County just as the legendary Loch Ness monster provides a tourism draw for northern Scotland? Jackie Johnson of the Lakeland Area Chamber of Commerce says she hasn't received any calls about the creature and doesn't anticipate a marketing campaign. \"I don't know that anybody is seriously considering it from a Lakeland standpoint,\" Johnson says. \"The idea of Lakeland being associated with swamps -I'm not sure how we could use it.\" Gary White can be reached at gary.white@theledger.com or at 863-802-7518.",

            "Observed.1  ": "monster that some call Bigfoot...Reports of these creatures have come from virtually all  parts of the county. In the swamps and  remote woods around Parramore and Two  Egg in eastern Jackson County, for example,  many stories are told of the Two Egg \u0093Stump  Jumper,\u0094 a sort of mini-bigfoot that is often  seen in the headlights of cars at night or  lurking in the darkness around rural homes.  Similar sightings have been reported in the  swamps along the Chipola River, particularly  in the Forks of the Creek area between  Malone and Campbellton. Other reports have  come from the swamps along the  Apalachicola River and the vast cypress  forests of Ocheesee Pond. It was in this last locality in 1884 that a party  of searchers pulled off one of the few  documented captures of a Bigfoot-like  creature that in the parlance of those days  was called the \u0093Wild Man of the Woods.\u0094 Sightings of the Wild Man were nothing new  in the 19th century South. Indians told early  settlers of a strange man-like creature that  roamed remote swamps and woods.  Covered with hair and much taller than  normal humans, the monster was  considered dangerous and most who  encountered him would not approach him. ...Located below Grand Ridge and Sneads in  the southeast corner of Jackson County,  Ocheesee Pond was a focal point for early  settlers. More than three miles long and  nearly that distance wide, the clear water  pond fills a vast shallow basin. While there  are some sections of open water, primarily  along its southernmost reaches, most of  Ocheesee Pond is covered with a dense  growth of cypress and other swamp trees. It  is a strikingly beautiful place, but the swamp can easily feel a bit foreboding as well. The Wild Man traditionally favored such  dense and swampy locations, but in 1883  local residents nevertheless were surprised  when their neighbors began reporting  encounters and sightings of one of the  creatures. He seemed to live on berries and  other edibles that grew wild in and around  the pond and was often seen swimming or  wading as he moved from island to island.  He tried his best to stay away from humans,  but his cries often shattered the nighttime  stillness of the farms and homes nestled  along the shores of the pond. As the number of sightings increased, so too  did concerns about the safety of local  families. Residents of the pond area  gathered and discussed the situation and  finally decided that an effort should be  launched to capture or drive off the monster.  Men assembled with guns, boats and  horses and a plan was devised by which they  would converge on the creature\u0092s last  reported location from various directions at  once. Many of these men had served only twenty  years before in the Confederate Army. They  knew the pond well and had seen far scarier  things in their lifetimes than a man covered  in hair...It did not take them long to find their  prey and on August 18, 1884, startling news  went out from Columbus, Georgia: News brought by the steamer Amos Hays  from Lower River is to the effect that the wild  man captured in Ocheecee Swamp, near  Chattahoochee, and carried to Tallahassee,  did not belong to a Florida asylum, and that  all inquiry proved unavailing to identify him.  He had been swimming in Ocheecee Lake,  from island to island, and when taken was  entirely destitute of clothing, emaciated, and  covered with a phenomenal growth of hair.  He could give no account of himself, and the  theory is that he escaped from an asylum of  some other state, and spent his time in the  woods, living on berries, &c. Other reports followed, but the details were  consistent. The captured Wild Man acted  insane, was covered with a thick growth of  hair and had lived deep in the swamps. The newspapers of the time, however, were  silent on the eventual fate of the Ocheesee  Pond Wild Man. Despite the fact that his body  was covered in thick hair, he was human  enough in appearance that his captors  believed that he probably had escaped from  an asylum. No asylum reported such an odd  escapee, however, and his captors became  even more baffled by the Wild Man.",
