            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone a few weeks after he spotted this animal.  He was very observant of what he saw in the short time he had visual on this Sasquatch and was able to recall lots of detail.The witness was traveling with his family late afternoon about 4:30pm. He was driving and heading east on Sharpe Mill Road in Alexander County, North Carolina, very near the Iredell County line. Sharpe Mill Road turns into Damascus Church Road after crossing into Iredell County. The area is mixed patches of woods and farmland, and is on the Eastern foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The witness looked to the North and spotted a large hairy biped crossing a power line cut.  It was approximately 150-200 yards away at the top of a ridge. He estimated the height at seven to nine feet. He also described it as being thin and \"lanky\". The animal was traveling very quickly between two patches of woods that the power lines bisected.  It was not running but seemed to \"glide\" as it walked. He noticed that it had long six inch reddish-brown hair over its entire body. He could not make out any facial features or head shape.  It looked down and was hunched over the entire time he viewed it. He noticed it had extremely long arms, almost to its knees, and was walking with its palms forward, and with long arm swings. The entire encounter lasted between eight to ten seconds. The witness told his family after seeing it that \"I think I just saw a Bigfoot.\" He turned the car around to go back and look, but by the time he returned it had gone into the woods.The witness was absolutely positive about what he saw. He had great recollection of the sighting and was very credible.  No one else in the car viewed the Sasquatch. He has not told anyone but me and his family of the sighting.That area of Alexander County is very rural with woods and farms. There is a lot of agriculture, with apple orchards, cattle and chicken farms.  Wildlife is abundant with a large population of deer, wild turkeys and other small mammals. Outz Creek is the major waterway in this area of the county. It is dammed in two spots to form small lakes.",

            "Observed": "Saw the report of wood knocking on Fitzsimmons Road in Oak Creek WI and wanted to comment that I experienced this in the very same area back in 1976 or so. I was with 3 friends parked at the cul de sac that used to be right off Fitz between the RR tracks and lake. The short stretch went north about 1/4 mile or less. There was one streetlight at the end of the road - nothing else. Back then, there were no walking paths - the area was more remote than today. It was late in the summer - well past dusk. Probably between 9 - 10pm. We were hanging out outside the vehicle. We hear a series of wood knocks in the distance - didn't give it much though. After several minutes, another series, only closer. Close enough it got our attention and we commented. A few more minutes and now a series of 2 or 3 knocks very loud and close. We bagged it into the truck and got out of there. If it was someone messing with us, I don't know where they could have come from or how they could move through the woods in total darkness.",
