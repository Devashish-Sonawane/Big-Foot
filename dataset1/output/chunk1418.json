From heel to heel to prints were 4 1/2 feet apart, tracks were approx 16 inches long. one tracks still had toe impressions in it.  I counted about 20 good tracks and there were others that were fading out. I shot video of the tracks and went home.  The next day I went back up to look for more in that location and found more across the road but they were badly weatherd.",

CA and have heard night screams that sounded like an incredibly loud out-of-control frat party in 1985 when a friend and I were remote camping in a heavily wooded unihabited area around Patrick Creek in Del Norte Co. just north of Humboldt.  There were voices in deep male tonations as well as slightly higher and higher still [juvenile?]  I've heard coyotes, bears wolves etc etc. I've also spent time with my sister who was doing her graduate project in anthropolgy on primates at the San Diego zoo.  The closest I can compare the sounds to were Howler monkeys, but controlled.  The voices almost sounded like a dialect but none I've ever heard; like I could almost make out words.  The sounds were definitely primate in nature though definitely not human.",
