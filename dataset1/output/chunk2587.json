            "Observed": "My wife and I were driving around and we were on a back road out in Wytheville, Virginia on queens knob road. It was dark out, not too late but it was dark and as we turned a corner my wife and I saw something in the middle of the road. It was about 4 foot tall and COVERED in fur. It was NOT a dog or any 4-legged animal. It was on 2 legs and it saw our car and ran and jumped over the fence towards the left like it was nothing. It pumped its arms as it ran and then jumped over the fence without using any effort at all. It then proceeded to run through the field with the sheep and we lost sight of it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness within a week of the incident.  The witness was driving home after fishing.  It was just getting dark.  The time was between 7:30 and 8 pm.  Both Jonathan and his wife saw what he described as a monkey looking animal of about 4 feet tall with very long arms.  It was blackish-brown in color.  He said it ran in front of his vehicle and jumped a ditch and fence with ease.  After it jumped in the air, it grabbed the fence with one hand to propelled itself over and onto the other side.  It then ran through a small field where there are sheep being kept.  After looking on a map, I noticed that it was running towards a thin patch of trees that it could use as cover to continue on to a larger forested area.  The witness said that even though it was so small, its steps were much longer than his.  The witness claims that this isn't the first time they've seen this thing.  Sometime last year, they saw it cross the same road within about 100' of this crossing, but this is the first time they've reported it to the BFRO.    ",
