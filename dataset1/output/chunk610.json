The night of the howl, Sunday, everyone had left and it was a lot quieter than it had been.--A few other people were in the camping, but witness has no idea if they heard the howl.--Campground is located across the street from the Shell Station, with a park behind it.  After the park, there is nothing but mountains.  --Estimated the howl came from one-quarter of a mile away and echoed off the hills.  The howl was long and constant and would be 20-30 seconds of a howl, quiet for 5 seconds, then repeat for a total of five minutes.  The howl was from a single individual.--Witness would guess that the animal making the sound was an older male, because the  howl was deep.--One half hour later, coyotes came by.--Dog did not react to the coyotes but was very upset by the howl.  Dog was afraid and had its tail between its legs.--No other sounds or footprints were noted.--Witness lived in the area for eight years, and is experienced in hiking and camping.  --Witness played howl on the BFRO website for brother two weeks ago, and brother agreed the sound was the same as they heard at Mammoth Lakes.",
