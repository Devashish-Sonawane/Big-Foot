About four miles south of our camp, as we were talking softly together while we walked, a loud crashing noise behind us came to our attention. My Uncle, an experienced hunter and woodsman of many years, replied that it sounded like we had spooked a large bull elk. Having accustomed ourselves to the area over the last few days, we knew that a deep canyon running through that location about 3 hundred yards in the direction the animal was moving would slow it down. Thinking that we could possibly get a fair shot as it crossed this canyon below us, the three of us started in pursuit.",
