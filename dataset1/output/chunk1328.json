I did not see anything or hear anything else.  I reported this before but called the tree knocks Bonks.   Also while hunting near Kimbrough, AL I heard one tree knock again.

The creek went from water to a muddy spot about 15'(?) long and then back to water. It looked like they walked out of the water into the mud making the prints then back into the water on the other side. The feet prints were from bare feet as the toe and heel impression were very reconizable. They were about the size of my size twelve shoe and had a longer leg stance then me (i'm about 5'10\"). They went east straight down the creek/ditch heading towards the Embarrass River which is about 1/8 mile away from the prints.",
