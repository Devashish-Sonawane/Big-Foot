            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with this family for six hours on August 3, 2001, including a five hour night surveillance from their home.The mother and daughter have both had two sightings apiece, one mutual and one each separate.  We concluded they have seen two separate creatures because of height differences.  The first was estimated at 6 feet or so, and the second, based on physical structures at the site, I estimate at 7 1/2 -8 feet in height.They have innumerable stories of relatives, friends, and neighbors having had sightings, vocalizations, or experiences over the years in this area.The aunt who lives next door, perhaps 40 yards through the trees but easily in view, has had at least 3-4 sightings from her house.Unbelievable as it sounds, the creature(s) seem to be raiding garbage containers in the housing unit.  The witnesses live across the street from a deep canyon that is thick with ponderosa pine and scrub oak.  Visibility is 15-20 yards at most.  During my night of surveillance with them, from 8 pm to 1 am, we heard 2 unusual grunt-like sounds from down in the canyon.The daughter's most recent sighting was a Friday night about July 14, 2001,  She was awakened by heavy footsteps outside her bedroom, sat up to look out the upstairs window, and saw the head and shoulders of a huge dark creature walk by between the house and the family clothes lines.",
