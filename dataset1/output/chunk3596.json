            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness by phone.His report above is very detailed and he has no doubt what it was. He remembers the eyes well because, \"the eyes looked into your soul, they were hypnotizing.\" It was so dark, but I asked if the eyes were very close together or spaced. He said they seemed about ten to twelve inches apart. He described them as cat like, tear drop shape. When the figure followed them, he could see the eyes go behind trees and they never bobbed up and down. The figure with the eyes always stayed in the darkest part of the forest. It was too dark to see ears, shoulders or arms. He never heard any branches break nor smelled any foul odor. While following them, it was quiet when walking. It never made any grunts or vocalizations. When they rushed up to it, the witness felt the presence of a massive animal. He thought it seemed curious about them but they were very scared. I asked what did he and his friend think it was. He said after several minutes they realized it was a Bigfoot but did not want to admit it. The entire encounter lasted between thirty and sixty minutes. ",

We watched it get up,walkaround on 2 feet,and sit down on nearby stump.We didn't go and check it out,because if we just happen to meet it on our way and it go balistic on us we might have been in a little of trouble.So we got the hell out of there.",
