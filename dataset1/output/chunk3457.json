I went to where I last saw it I concluded it was aprox 8 ft tall from a tree it had stood next to when it stopped to look our way. I then realized what we had seen was not a hunter or a bear. It was a hot august afternoon no tracks to prove what I had seen but I will never be told otherwise what we observed that day.",
