As I read more I thought that this might be a similar incident, and after listening to the recording of the scream (although I think much of the true sound is not captured) I am almost convinced. Of course this may have been some large animal, but because of the similarities with other peoples experiences I decided to report it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness regarding an encounter in Central New Jersey. After having spoken with the witness two nights this week, I believe that the witness is a credible observer. The witness added to his initial report as follows. This week, approximately a month after the initial observation of vocalizations, the witness and his wife returned to the site. The witness expanded on the initial report regarding the vocalizations saying that they were as close as 50 feet from the road, and that they were very, very loud. In his opinion, they were beyond the capabilities of a human in terms of volume. The area is semi rural and in which there has recently been large scale commercial development (malls, office buildings, warehouse facilities). The witness stated that deer are plentiful in the area and that there are still quite a number of farms cultivating edible crops. The witness indicated that he and his wife came upon a \"depression\" that had the basic outlines and shape of a footprint. The depression measured approx. 15\" long, 7\" wide across the ball and 4\" across the heel. Toe prints were not discernible as there had been rain in the area which obscured details. There were no other prints visible, perhaps because there were no other areas nearby of bare soil. The next night the witness and his wife drove past the area where they first heard the vocalizations. There is an abandoned barn and abandoned farm stand, and a circular driveway which cuts through the property containing the structures; it is bare yards long. The witness drove down the driveway from one end and his wife down the other. As the witness started to drive down the driveway, he smelled a strong, acrid \"skunky\" smell that turned into a dead animal type of smell; he looked around but could find no source for the smell. It was transitory and disappeared quickly; however, there was little or no wind. The witness volunteered that he will make discrete inquiry of local farmers to see if they experienced anything unusual and call us if anything further is revealed. ",
