            "Observed": "My teenage son is a night owl and was awake in his bedroom late one night/early one morning.  Approximately 2 or 3 am, he heard what he described as a \"metal scraping on wood\" sound outside his bedroom window.  He then heard several inhalations/exhalations as if something was sniffing at the window followed by a loud grunt.  He described this sound as \"buck snort\" or someone clearing their throat.  We have 3 little dogs in a pen right by his window and he reported that the dogs were not barking which is odd because they usually bark at everything!!  He immediately got out of bed and spent the rest of the night on the couch.  He wouldn't sleep for several nights following this incident.  He told me about it the next morning.  When I got home from work that afternoon, I went around to his window to investigate.  The window was open approximately 1-2 inches.  We have casement type windows and he had rolled them in but not latched them so they could have been opened from the outside but it would have taken some effort.  We live near a major highway so I immediately thought that it might be a vagrant trying to break in.  2 days later, I returned home from shopping around dusk and found the door on a camping trailer we had on the property had been opened.  No one was in the trailer and nothing appeared to have been tampered with.  The metal that my husband had wedged in the door to latch it was on the ground right by the steps.  The wind wasn't blowing that day so we know it didn't blow open.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This is a very credible, articulate witness. Her husband and son were present and contributed to our conversation. These details can be added: \u0095  Three years ago while she was working around her home, putting her Fall decorations out, something howled at her at an approximate distance of 75 yards from the direction of the pond close to their property. It had an unmistakable human quality to it. She considered that someone might be playing with her so she howled back mimicking its mournful cry.  It immediately answered her with the same howl she had heard before; she got spooked and ran into her home. \u0095 In December of 2006 between 1:30 and 2 AM she moved herself and her Chihuahua from her bedroom to the living room couch because she was having trouble sleeping. She had tried to wake her husband, but he was snoring and deeply asleep. She was just getting settled when she heard an earsplitting sound that started as a howl but modulated into a thunderous, blood curdling, scream.  The howl was approximately 10 to 15 seconds in duration and had the feel of communicating hurt or anger. She reported it was not a feline sound and like nothing she had ever heard. It woke her husband and both lay wide awake and completely still, both being too afraid to look outside. They related that it was within 25 yards of their home. When asked why it might have screamed, she replied that they had recently put a hot wire fence around the top and bottom of their dog pen. Her belief is that it came into direct contact with the electric fence. The dogs in the pen, and the Chihuahua were dead silent.\u0095 In the most recent event her twenty year-old son was in his bedroom with the lights off, listening to music. The wood/metal scraping sound at his casement window got his attention; he then heard deep breathing and what he described as primal \u0093Ape at the zoo\u0094 sounds. The incident lasted between 3 to 5 minutes.\u0095 Most of the activity they have experienced around their property occurs in the fall and winter.\u0095 Their property is 4 miles from the Cimarron River. There are also deep ravines close to their property.   ",
