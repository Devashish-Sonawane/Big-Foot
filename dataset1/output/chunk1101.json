            "Follow-Up Report": "I had a very nice phone conversation with the witness, as well as multiple email exchanges. As he had mentioned he was a photographer for the Texas State Travel Guide & Texas Highways magazines for many years and had long running contracts with both magazines until he retired. He is a trained observer and as any professional photographer who is worth his salt, they know the minutia of how cameras work, lighting, exposures, distance etc. I am from Texas originally and these two magazines are known to me and are very slick commercial publications. As stated, he found a good place to park his state issued vehicle and headed into the woods off of Hwy 150. He was between Cold Spring and New Waverly Texas. Another assignment he had was to photograph a haunted historic jail in Cold Spring and he thought he would kill two assignments in one trip and get his shots of woods and some wildlife at the same time. It was \u0093late afternoon light\u0094 and he was looking for some photos of sunlight as it filtered through the very tall cedar and pine trees prevalent in East Texas. He was about 1- 2 miles into the forest when he got to a clearing for power lines and decided this was a good spot. This clearing was not the usual clear cut for massive powerline towers, which are in the 150 ft. wide range. This clearing was about 20-30 ft. wide. It was cleared for utility poles for a small community of homes close to the outskirts of the state forest. Small average telephone poles. He sat close to one tree line and was \u0093watching for deer or a rabbit so he could get his shot and move on\u0094. After a few minutes he \u0093heard a loud crashing noise opposite the side of the woods he was sitting in\u0094 and it did startle him. As he was thinking to himself that \u0093that was no deer, because deer make almost no noise\u0094, a juvenile black bear emerged from the forest and \u0093put its nose up in the air and was sniffing\u0094. As he mentioned it abruptly turned around and ran back into the woods it emerged from. He does not know if the bear saw him or ran because of something else. He did not speculate one way or the other on that. He also mentioned he started to follow the bear but stopped as soon as he started, as he figured the mama was very nearby. He estimated the cub was no taller than 2-3 feet at the shoulder, and a full grown black bear in Texas can get up to 5-6 feet long and weigh up to 400 lbs. plus. He has seen bigger bears than that, so he assumed it was a younger one. At this point he had just started to turn to walk back to where he was sitting when he smelled a \u0093roadkill/dead animal smell\u0094. Almost simultaneously there was a sound of a tree trunk snapping. He saw a huge dark shape about 10-12 feet away from me through some very thick Yaupon brush. \u0093I\u0092m 6\u00923 and I was looking up at a 20 to 30 degree angle to its head and huge shoulders\u0094. It was very definitely \u0093humanoid in shape\u0094. Yaupon bushes are in the holly family and can grow to 20 ft. tall and are somewhat spindly and have red berries as they grow in the wild. As he stared in shock at what he was seeing, the right arm moved over to it\u0092s left side (this is when he saw fingers)  and \u0093 a 2-3\u0094 diameter tree trunk about 15 feet long came flying or falling towards me\u0094. He told me the tree was probably not thrown as much as it was snapped and pushed down exactly towards where he was standing. As for the fingers he saw it was a split second view. As the creature was reaching its right arm over to its left, he saw the fingers on the left hand already around the tree. He said it was at least 8 feet tall. This was a silhouette of a massive upright creature seen through scrub. Enough ambient light in the woods to be certain it was something he wanted no part of. It was a \u0093dark humanoid shape\u0094 and he could not speculate that it may have been the coloring of the creature or just the shadowing. Didn\u0092t matter. He was outta there in a heartbeat. This report becomes a Class B instead of a Class A. A Class A is a clear unobstructed view, and this was an observation through spotty scrub bushes, tall trees with filtered sunlight and shadowing as you would expect in a forested area, and everything he saw was in split second intervals. But he was certain as to what he was seeing.This is a classic example why we get no close photos and few distant blobsquatch photos. Here you have a trained professional photographer with professional equipment in a wooded environment. Presented with a potentially life-threatening situation, he was stricken with fear. Fearing that he might be attacked by something so close to him, there was no thought to raise the camera to get a money shot. We spoke about that. He kicks himself to this day about not raising his camera. He was all about getting the heck out of there. That's what happens when someone is in self-preservation mode, even a professional photographer.He reacted like virtually anyone would, especially if they had no idea what they were encountering or what to expect from it. Those who wonder aloud why we have no good close range photos need only imagine his exact scenario and honestly consider what you would do. ",
