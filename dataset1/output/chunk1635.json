The thing was very large, dirty white, taller than the street sign that was near, and fury and I could tell it was not human or anything I had ever seen before, it scared me so bad I had tears in my eyes and started shaking and at that time I went straight home and told my husband about it.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Upon interviewing both the witness and her husband, these additional details came forth...There was frenzied night-time barking by neighborhood dogs for 3 consecutive nights prior to the sighting. The barking continued the following night and then stopped.Unusual vocals described as a very deep, powerful, echoing scream or holler were heard.The area used to be heavily mined years ago and still has some exposed mine entrances. It contains thousands of acres of heavy forests and swamps consisting of pine and hardwoods with ample food sources of vegetation and wildlife, including many deer.There are also several nearby creeks and ponds.This area also has a rich history of sightings, including the sightings of the same or other dirty-white individuals along with dark colored creatures. As mentioned in the report, her husband's sister also had an encounter with a white creature when she was 10 years old. See Report #27480.The witness was so startled by the initial encounter that she jerked her leg while in the driver's seat and broke one of her flip-flops. Her husband reported that when she got home she was terrified and shaking, with tears in her eyes. She described its hair as being fairly unifom in length, except on the head, where it was much longer. Although she got within 10 yards of the creature, she did not get a good look at its face because at this time she was looking at it through the rear-side window which is darkly tinted.",
