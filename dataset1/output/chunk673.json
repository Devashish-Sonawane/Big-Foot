Also stopped and various times to lift noses and sniff something upwind, i took this to be a bear.",

            "Observed": "I was up off old strawberry road on sunday afternoon about 4pm. Take left before you get to strawberry proper off 108. I was getting the dogs out of the truck. Its a one lane old road, there was a turn about 300 yards away. I caught something out of the corner of my eye, looked up and saw the top halves of what I took to be two people walking across the street very quickly with their hoods up (I assumed hoods because of the peak on the head). They were almost across the street and at the point in the curve where I could not see them anymore... when I looked up. I figured they would be coming toward me or I would be able to see them going away from me as there is no trail up the hill from where I saw them and they crossed at a turn in the road where I could not see, but could see the road before and after the turn.  Never saw them again. I didn't worry about it, took the dogs for a walk down to check out the river for opening trout season in a couple days.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Conversation with witness added this info: The larger of the two was closest to him, the smaller one seemed to be \"trying to catch up\" or hurrying to stay next to the larger one. Witness saw arm swing and upright posture of the figures, which led him to first believe they were people crossing the road. Survey of the spot where they crossed and the fact that they were both darkly colored with \"hoods on\" made him think that he may have seen two bigfoots. He found a 2' slide mark on the upper road bank where it looked as if something tried to step up the bank in one step and slid down a little from the top, and a possible bare footprint next to the slide mark where it appeared to him that it \"caught\" itself as it slid. Just the ball of foot and toes (which is what a bear track looks like, but these figures were bipedally walking across road).The witness is articulate, and non-committal on his identification. He says he did not see them long enough to say for certain that they were bigfoots, but the circumstances surrounding the event led him to believe that its a strong possibility.",
