What they could see through lightly falling snow was a bipedal creature.  It was very well built with long arms and clearly walking on two legs.  They watched the animal for several minutes.As it moved back into the woods the men could hear branches snapping and moaning and then screams.  He remembers three screams each lasting several seconds with about 5 minutes between each scream.The six men did return nervously the next day to finish collecting the jugs.Although he still lives near this area and has hunted around southwest Wyoming he has never returned to this location.",

She heard a growling screaming like sound coming from our field across the road. The sound was moving from the field across the road to the field behind the house. She heard the sound every couple min. She tried to observe any movement in the moonlight, but saw nothing. The next day after work she told me what she had heard. Being the 10th of Dec. it was dark when She got home at 5:30 p.m.. We decided to take a spot light and see if we could see any couger tracks. What we found were tracks that walked on two feet had a long stride and had a large footprint. The next day after thinking things over I went back out to the tracks and took a few photo's. The weather was warm for Wis. this time of the year and the tracks were all but gone, howerever I did find a couple somewhat intact prints.",
