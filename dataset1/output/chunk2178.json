            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for approximately 90 minutes in mid-January 2015, regarding his reported Sasquatch encounter.  The witness is an avid outdoorsman who enjoys hiking, fishing and deer hunting.  His encounter occurred in a region of the East Fork State Park area, while hunting deer on one of the horse trails branching off the Twin Bridges Road. The witness decided to hunt in an area along a game trail near a clearing containing fresh deer tracks that he thought would be secluded from other hunters.  He also discovered a ladder stand that someone had set-up, but was not using and decided this would be an ideal spot.  The witness hunted until just before dark, and as he was gathering up his gear to depart, he heard two distinct \u0093owl hoots\u0094 which, reminded him of the calls that he had heard on \u0093Finding Bigfoot\u0094 The witness started walking back toward his truck along the game trail when he suddenly noticed several small bent trees and broken branches that resembled a stick structure.  At this time the witness started to wonder if what he had heard was a possible Sasquatch, so he decided to try some wood knocks using a branch he had found. After initiating a few knocks, the witness did not hear anything and started walking back to his truck. However, a few minutes later the witness heard two loud knocks, a whoop, and a long drawn out yip.  By this time it was nearly dark and the witness was starting to get very nervous, so he walked briskly back to his truck.  When he arrived home, the witness believed that he had an encounter with a Sasquatch and decided to file a report.  After interviewing the witness and reviewing the location of his encounter, I believe this individual is very genuine and credible.  Numerous individuals have reported Sasquatch encounters throughout the East Fork State Park region, including sightings, vocalizations, and wood knocks.  The area is teeming with deer, rabbit and other small game and the rivers and lake are well stocked with fish. In addition, the location of this witness\u0092 encounter is not far from where another research investigator and I had a similar Sasquatch encounter while conducting an investigation in the fall of 2012.  Given his familiarity with the outdoors, the amount of detail that he provided, as well as the location of this activity, I sincerely believe this witness did in fact have a Sasquatch encounter.  ",
