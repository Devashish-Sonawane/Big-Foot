            "Observed": "Earlier this evening (6-5-21) 4 of us were boating at Salt Fork in Ohio. I live less than 10 miles so I\u0092ve fished and boated out here for years. This evening (8pm, lake is very busy with several boats in ski zone), we decided to take a break from the ski zone and headed back into a cove for a few minutes. After going about half way back into the cove, we all heard an unusual sound come from our back left (heavily wooded area). It was loud enough to hear over the motor. I shut off the engine so we could figure out what it was. The only way I can describe the sound is like an old mechanical tornado/air raid siren starting to wind up. The sound had a very unusual pronounced low end frequency, or \u0093bassy\u0094 in layman\u0092s terms. You could literally almost feel the sound. There are no sirens located out here. I have never heard a sound like that out here, or anywhere before. We\u0092ve all heard stories of Sasquatch being out here, but I\u0092m very skeptical of this stuff and joke about it usually on every outing. I thought it was unusual, but \u0093Bigfoot\u0094 was definitely not my first answer as to what we heard. After we got back home and kids in bed I googled \u0093Bigfoot air raid siren\u0094 and eventually came across an audio clip called the Ohio Howl from the BFRO website, and it\u0092s very close to sounding like what we heard, except ours was closer to us.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on the phone and he identified the area they were at, where the sound came from and the details of the encounter.I also spoke with a local bigfoot group that regularly has members that spend weekend evenings doing hikes, camping and investigations in Salt Fork. They reported back to me that they did indeed have someone in the park that night, they were not doing vocals.I then spoke with park rangers to see if any of their watercraft enforcement craft were active in the area. They were not. DEERASSIC is located across St.Rt. 22 about a mile away and they were not having any activities that weekend.There is a road adjacent to the wooded area that the sound came from. It is used by night fishermen where the road meets the lake. That section of wooded area does not have any hiking trails and the under brush is very heavy this time of year.This area as well as other areas like it in Salt Fork has produced many reports from credible witnesses like this one.",

            "Observed": "My sister and her two children, my wife and I and our two dogs went to Nuclear lake in Dutchess county for an overnight camping trip. We set up camp in a field next to the lake a few hundred feet off the applician trail. We had two tents and went in them to sleep around 11:00p.m. My sister was feeling uneasy so I sent my male dog to her tent to sleep with her and the kids. My older dog, my wife, and myself were in my tent. I turned the opening of my tent to face my sisters tent door so she felt less stressed. An hour went by and the kids my old dog and wife were sleeping. Suddenly I heard foot steps coming from the woods heading toward us. It was a very dark night but I saw no flashlight shine. Then my young dog in my sisters tent started to make this whine/growl and I could clearly hear a person walk behind my sisters tent, but still no flashlight shine! All the while my sister was awake and my young dog freaking out almost crying and he is a pitbull not afraid of any critter. I KNEW it was a bigfoot and told my sister not to worry because she hates the woods and couldnt sleep. The next morning she looked very tired and we only spoke about it a month later on the phone. She said she knew it was a biped and couldnt sleep all night. My wife, my two dogs and I are trail runners and twice a week do 6 mile runs on this section of the Appalacian trail. It is remote and rugged and I have Moose dropping on my fireplace mantle from that area and bear sightings are common. A few miles up the trail is a large beautiful swamp also. This is not my first time I had the feeling bigfoot was around. My wife and I are in the woods more then anyone I know. We hike and back pack all summer and log 25 miles a week in the woods trail running. I made a report a few years ago when we were hiking up Buck mountain when a bigfoot was smashing trees and making that loud click noise like I can do with my tounge but 10 times louder. I know a woman who had a daytime visual in st. lawrence county n.y. and I also know a man who had a visual in penn. when he was hunting deer. What is the real story on bigfoot. Are they so slick that no one can get a good picture or do they just scare people so much that the powers that be dont want the cat out of the bag. I wont go in the deep woods alone anymore and I was never afraid but now I am and hate that feeling. I'll give my name and number and I sure wish someone would call me. thanks.",
