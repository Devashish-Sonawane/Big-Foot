            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness called tonight the 28th of March 2004, and we went over his rendition of his 1999 sighting along Hwy.78 in Imperial county of California.  The witness is a 31-year-old, semi truck driver, and he was returning home to Holtville when he pulled over to spend a few hours sleeping on a dirt pullout that truckers use along that lonely stretch of desert Hwy.  The witness\u2019s encounter included a visual of the creature, a very strong smell, and a loud grunt.The first thing the witness noticed when he pulled off of the road was the strong dead decaying skunk smell, so, when he stopped the truck he turned off the engine, he left the head lights on just in case he might step on something as he stepped out of his truck to take care of business on the passenger side.  As he was standing along side of the passenger side of the truck, he began hearing rocks falling like an animal was walking down a mountainside. At about this same time, the dead skunk smell, which was bad, got even worse, like a gagging type of a smell.At that instant, he observed this longhaired, large framed creature walking in front of his truck, and through his headlights, and then across the road making a loud grunting noise. Now this last series of events put the witness into a very frightened mode, and he had a strong feeling that he had to get out of there NOW!I needed to ask the witness a few specific questions about just what he saw that evening in late November 1999.Describe the area in which the incident occurred:  \u201cIt was a dirt pullout that truckers use for sleeping a few hours. The area is a total desert setting that is located on Hwy. 78 as it crossed the Chocolate Mountains, in Imperial county of California.\u201dWhere about in Imperial county did this happen?  \u201cIt is located about twenty or so miles north of Glamis, Ca., and about thirty miles south of Blythe, Ca. on highway 78.\u201dWhat was the distance you would estimate that you were from it?  \u201cAbout twenty to twenty-five feet away.\u201dWhat was your first reaction? \u201cAt first I was startled and caught off guard, and that turned into amazement, and then that quickly turned into that scared feeling.\u201dWhat was it doing? \u201cIt was walking away from me in front of my truck and across the road, like it was bow legged, and I could only see its left rear side in the head lights.\u201dDid it stand on two legs, and did it ever go down on all fours?  \u201cOnly saw it use its two legs as it walked across the road, and it never went down on all fours.\u201dWas it covered with hair, and what color was it?  \u201cIt was covered with hair on the half that I saw, and the color was a dark brown, but the back looked grayish.  The upper hair looked to be longer and seemed to flow as it moved.\u201dWhat would you estimate its weight and height was?  \u201cI thought it might weigh about 650 lb., and its height was about 7 to 71/2 feet tall.\u201dDid you ever see any facial features, and could you describe them? \u201cNo to both, but I did notice that there wasn\u2019t much of a neck and it seemed as if the head was mounted on its well muscled shoulders.\u201dCould you describe the arms? \u201cThey seemed long and very muscular and the fingers looked like they went below the knees.\u201dCould you tell if it was a male or a female? \u201cNo, but it looked like it could pick up a 1000 lb. pallet with no problem.\u201dAbout how long did you see it? \u201cAbout 5 to 8 seconds.\u201dDid it ever make any noise?  \u201cYes! It made a grunting sound as it crossed the road in front of my truck, like somebody clearing their throat, but much louder. This is when I sensed the fear, and I knew that I had to get out of here.\u201dDid it ever see you? \u201cI don\u2019t know.  It had to know that I was there. I only saw one side of it as it crossed the road.\u201dDid you ever smell anything? \u201cYes! As I said, while in the truck it smelled like a dead decaying skunk.  But, as the creature passed in front of the truck, that smell turned into a gagging smell that made me sick, and I felt that fear that I had to leave now. There was a slight breeze coming from the creature towards me.\u201dHave you ever discussed this sighting with anyone else or an agency?  \u201cNo, I have never told anyone, not even my wife. I just didn\u2019t want anybody to think that I was crazy.\u201dIn summary:  The witness was adamant and credible in his retelling of his sighting. I know we might find it difficult to think of this creature in a desert setting like this, but there is plenty of game, such as deer, snakes, rabbits, and other small creatures that live out there.  Water and foliage are provided by the Colorado River, and there are several canals that traverse that area for the agricultural plantations that permeate Imperial County.I believe the sound, smell, and the visual of this creature that occurred at about the same instant caused the witness's fear and made him feel he had to leave at immediately.  The witness is half Native American, and he has heard stories from his elders about the hairy man of the desert who will get you if you are not good, but he never believed them.  The witness\u2019s people also say that if the hairy one touches you, then you are blessed.  He now has a different outlook about the out of doors.",

            "Observed": "I took a 3 day/2 night solo backpacking trip in Washington state, up the Ape Canyon Trail, around the base of Mt. St. Helens, and through the Muddy River drainage this past July 5th through 7th.   On the  first day of the hike at around 1 pm, as I made my way up the Ape  Canyon Trail, I was surprised to hear a series of \"whooping\" calls, a  series of 5 whoops in a row spaced at intervals of about 30 seconds to  1 minute apart, 5-7 sets over the course 10-15 minutes.  The calls (bwaaahh-bwaaahh-bwaaahh) sounded as if they were emanating  from the bottom of an oil drum, the tone being deep and bodily palpable, even though sounding maybe a mile or more away in the direction of the canyon, and somewhat north of the trail. It struck  me as unnaturally deep and projecting (although not overly loud) and unlike any animal call I had ever heard before (I have hiked and camped in forest and wilderness areas for many years).  I did not hear any  other calls during course of my hike, save what sounded like an  enormous owl hooting near my tent site on the edge of the Muddy River drainage on my 2nd night, at around 2 am.  It was very loud and I was not inclined to get out of my tent for a look-see.  One other thing I found intrigued me though.  On a game trail that slips off of the main trail, just down hill from a ground spring adjacent to the trail 1-2 miles from the trailhead, I came across a couple of downed trees approx. 4-5\" in diameter, twisted or snapped off and laying across the trail in a cross-x pattern. The trees were placed on the trail between the spring and a small meadow farther down the hill.   There were no signs of a lightening strike, no evidence of chopping or sawing was apparent, and the trees looked otherwise healthy and normal, and looked as if they had been pulled over and broken off toward the top of the tree.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This report is quite old, and yet had not been investigated. I called the witness and he was only too willing to talk about it, although surprised by the phone call. His narrative is complete as he recalls the events. The vocalizations he describes is consistent with sasquatch vocalizations by the description of the deep sound, amplitude, and the cadence. This is what has been heard by other witnesses as well as during investigations. The described \u0093very large owl\u0094 is also similar to what I and other investigators have heard in the Cascades. This could be either a sasquatch mimicking an owl, or it could be a very close barred owl. The trees, broken-off and placed across the trail in an \u0093x\u0094 pattern is also consistent with sasquatch behavior. The witness was up in the same area in August of 2011. He described to me some \u0093whoop\u0094 vocalizations. He said that he heard three calls. The vocalizations started out sounding like a person in tone, and then as the call was drawn-out it became higher in pitch, ending in a trill sound that he described as \u0093monkey-like\u0094. The feeling he got was that whatever this animal was, it was very large. He felt that the creature was 1 to 3 miles away. Although there are elk in the area which can make a similar sound, this is about a month too early for bull elk to be bugling.While it is impossible to say exactly what made the described vocalizations, the sounds are consistent with sasquatch vocalizations. There have been many other reports from this area over the years, including the famous account by Fred Beck in 1927 titled \u0093I Fought the Apemen of Mount St. Helens, Wa\u0094 which can easily found with an internet search.This picture was of the two trees placed across the trail.
