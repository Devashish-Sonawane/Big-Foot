            "Follow-Up Report": "I had a nice conversation with the witness. As she stated, she was headed back home after a snack run and returning movies. Since it was very humid, she had her windows down in the car. As she turned south off the main highway onto the gravel road to her home, she saw a creature starting to cross the road in front of her. It \"put it's arm up for a second to block the light from headlights\".Since she was on the last curve before she got to her house, she was already slowing down anyway. Now seeing this creature she slowed even more. She estimated she was less than 100 feet from it. She eventually settled on \"5-6 cars lengths\". It moved from right to left and \"walked like an old person, slow and methodical\". It was whitish/grayish and seemed \"dirty\". She never saw the face. She had come to a complete stop as the creature crossed in front of her. It had looked her way as it crossed the road but she saw no eye color. The hair was in the way so there was little more than a fleeting glimpse of the eye area anyway. She estimated the size as \"closer to seven feet than eight\" based on it being nearly twice the height of her vehicles hood. It had \"very long arms, walked upright with a slight humped over forward leaning gait\". And the \"smell was simply awful, disgusting and putrid\". Her windows were down due to the humid weather, and she got the full force of the stench. Between her headlights and the ambient light of the moon bouncing off the clouds, there was enough light for her to see it very clearly. She has no doubts about what she saw. I found her to be very truthful and sincere. She was definitely rattled by the event. Many stories from neighbors, friends and acquaintances about events in her area. The thing that was most interesting to me was her description of it \"walking like an old person\" as it crossed the road. Her assessment was that it just \"couldn't move any faster than that\". Add in the gray/white color which would be a human trait of aging and perhaps that explained it. It did to her anyway. I am familiar with this area. She is in midst of Mark Twain National Forest.  I have been investigating this area for years, with numerous reports investigated by myself and others. My brother has a 20 acre blueberry farm not more than 25 miles or so from her location.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The area of the sighting is the western portion of the Black Mountains cluster in Pisgah National Forest, northeast of Asheville.  It is mixed forest, dense with pine, hickory, oaks, mountain laurel, and rhododendron.  The area is laced with creeks and is swampy in some places.While driving in the area just outside of the witness's small community, he saw what he believed to be a bear scratching itself against a tree.  As the witness approached, he could see that the animal was not a bear.  He drove by the animal and turned around at the end of the road to see if he could observe it again, but the animal was gone.The subsequent day, the witness returned to the site.  A work crew was removing a fallen tree from the road.  The tree was believed to be the same tree by which the animal was standing.The sighting lasted about 25 to 30 seconds.  The witness describes the animal as being 6-1/2 to 7-1/2 feet tall and up to 500 pounds.  The head was pointed near the top, but the point could have been from the hair and not the shape of the skull itself.  The hair was a dark red or auburn and was very long.  The shoulders were very broad across.  Gender could not be determined nor could facial features be discerned.  The animal turned as the vehicle passed, apparently watching the vehicle.The witness is certain this was not another animal nor a joke.  In the mid-1980s, there was a small but expanding black bear population in the area.Due to the poor lighting conditions at dusk and the tree partially obstructing the view, this report is considered a Class B sighting.  However, the witness was fairly close to the animal, passing by it at a distance of approximately 20 feet at the nearest point.I found the witness to be credible.",
