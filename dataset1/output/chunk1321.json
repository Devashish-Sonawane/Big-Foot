He described the incident while answering my questions to expand details. The sighting was of short duration and in silhouette. The creature was standing in an open field about 40 yards from and lower in elevation from the witness. The car mentioned in his statement was traveling a road that circled the field. At no time did the headlights shine directly upon the animal. One item to note: When the animal turned to look in their direction, it turned its torso, not its neck. His report of screaming the following night was loud but not nearby. His best guess at the distance was 300-450 yards away from his house. ",
