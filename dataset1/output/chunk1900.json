            "Follow-Up Report": "Update:The witness contacted me and asked me to help her with a sketch, She said that the image of the bigfoot turning and looking at her is forever etched in her mind. Stating that it turned very much like the bigfoot did in the Patterson-Gimlin film, with its entire torso.  The witness is very happy with our sketch, stating \"I believe you've captured my \"booger\" perfectly.\"BFRO Investigator/Sketch Artist Sybilla IrwinSybillaIrwin.comI spoke to the witness by phone and she is credible.   The sighting was at a distance of thirty feet under a street light and lasted six to seven seconds. It was preceded by a series of popping noises that the witness thought might have been caused by the animal clicking its teeth. The animal was heading south, walking in the ditch between the mailbox and a hay field, and left no tracks. The body was muscular and heavy, estimated to be over 500 pounds and covered with a neat, white to light brown hair, one to two inches long. The creature's hairless face was brown in color, with a flat nose, thin lips and no visible ears. The appearance was very human. Its arms hung down to its knees and ended in large, hairless hands. The witness' aunt noticed an odor in the air that smelled like a dead and rotting animal.Caves dot this area of the Daniel Boone National Forest - London Ranger District. This District is best known for Laurel River Lake, a 5,600 acre reservoir. There is a small pond to the north and a creek directly east. Since the sighting, several witnesses have heard loud howling coming from the area north of the pond. The howls last about ten seconds each, and are repeated in a series for up to three minutes.  ",

            "Observed": "I [work] in Jasper County, Texas. On Thursday August 4, 2005, [in the early evening] I was walking [outdoors on company property surrounded by the Big Thicket]. There was some rustling in the underbrush about thirty yards off to the left side of the dirt road which I was travelling down. Shortly after hearing the rustling I began to smell what seemed like a mixture of a skunk and strong coffee mixed with kind of like a dead fish smell. At first I thought that it might have been some wild hogs bedding down for the evening, so I stopped to listen for anything that might have indicated piglets since wild sows are dangerous if they are protecting their young. After about thirty to forty-five seconds, the rustling around stopped. I couldn't see into the brush, but I felt like whatever was in there was watching me.  Not wanting to be the focus of a hog charge, I hollered in hopes that I would scare off whatever it was in the brush.  After not getting any response, I figured that whatever it was had left, so I resumed [what I was doing]. I had to go down to a gate and turn around. When I passed the spot where I had my encounter, I heard a whoo--whoo--whooping sound coming from behind me. It was quiet at first then it got louder as I got farther away. I was puzzled as to what could make that sound. I am an experienced deerhunter, and I have never heard that sound before. It sounded kind of like a howler monkey. In fact that's what I would have thought that it was if I didn't know any better. About two and a half hours later [at a different location] I smelled the same smell. I have smelled that smell there several times after dark. I would like for my specifics to be kept confidential, as well as my job title.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "When I spoke to the witness about his experience, he was adamant that what he heard sounded \"just like a monkey.\" He wrote of \"whoops\" in his report, and in talking directly with the witness, he was a bit more descriptive. The whoops occurred three times while he was in the area, and were described as being like a \"howler monkey\" or \"gibbon\" in a zoo. The witness was quite startled by the sounds; he had never heard anything like them in his experiences in the outdoors of North America.The smell was quite pungent and quite unusual, although the witness thought he had smelled it before. When the witness first smelled the odor, he considered it to be of hog origin, having no other frame of reference from which to draw. After he heard the vocalizations, the witness's perspective of what he was encountering began to change. It was then that he contemplated the possibility that he might be actually encountering something outside the parameters of known taxonomy.At the witness's request, I have edited his report so that any and all personal data remains totally confidential. All changes made by me appear in his report enclosed in [ ], and are only indicative of information that would compromise the identity, occupation and location of the witness.",
