            "Observed": "During the summer of 1986, my two friends and I were 16 years old and had aquired a bottle of home made apple wine.  We needed a place to consume said contraband without the prying eyes of the local police department that knew my two friends quite well.  We decided to drive north of Newberry to park on an old logging trail near Pine Stump Junction.  The three of us shared the one bottle.  It was not enough to get us drunk, but provided a slight buzz.  When our buzz had wore off, we started back for town.  It was around 10 pm and was quite dark when we were driving south on H37.  We were rounding a left hand curve in the road when our headlights shined onto a large black creature.  It was hunched down, kneeling over some roadkill. It was on the white line on the right side of the road and facing the right ditch, so it was broadside to us.  When our headlights shined on it, still in the crouched, kneeling position it turned and looked at us.  It stood on its hind legs and with two large steps, it disappeared into the woods as we passed at about 45 mph. It was about 7 to 8 feet tall, covered in black fur from head to toe.  The face was flat like that of an ape, not like a snout of a bear. I'm not proud to say this, but all three of us screamed like girls when we saw it.  We did not stop.  We rode in stunned silence for awhile, then I asked if we were going to report this.  My two delinquent friends agreed that we could not share the sighting with anyone.  They would ask what were we doing up there and then find out about the stolen wine.  I kept this sighting secret for all these years.  When I saw on Fox news that your organization was going into Marquette, MI, I found this web site.  I am thankful that I can finally share my story.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone, who was sincere and truthful about what he seen that night.  The creature they seen was only visible for about 3-4 seconds (it felt much longer to the witness), starting when it was illuminated in their headlights, until it walked into the forest.  It was initially crouched on its heels, inspecting roadkill on the side of the road.  It turned a little bit and looked at them, then with an 'easy, smooth' movement, it rose up and took two large steps into the forest.  They didn't stop the car to inspect the area further.  The creature was extremely large, with black hair all over its body. Recently the witness found out his sister and her husband had a sighting a few years after his on the same road near this area.  This sighting occurred in the winter, with 3-4 foot snowbanks on either side of the road.  A large, black-haired creature had stood up behind one of these snowbanks when they drove by, and they insisted it wasn't a bear. This area is in Lake Superior State Forest.",

            "Observed": "I was a girl.  I think it was 1969-70 and I was 10-11 years old.  I was sick and sleeping on the couch in the living room.  I heard our dog whining. He never whined. No stranger let alone an animal could come close to our dog as he was an agressive watchdog. The whining is what woke me up.  I looked out the window from the couch and then looked again trying to focus. It was dark and everybody else was sleeping. I saw a dark outline of a creature looking into the front room.  I saw its silhouette against the night sky.  It had to have been taller than 6 foot, and the window, if I remember correctly, was off the ground 3? feet and the window itself was 4? feet tall.  The creature took up the width of the window and there probably was about 6-8 inches of moonlit sky showing above its head.  It made no sound.  It just stood there looking in.  I don't remember anything else.  I probably thought I must be dreaming, but the impression of something watching me never left me and I never told anyone about it until I told a trusted friend about a year ago.  However, other members of my family, including myself at that period of time, heard sounds that summer--like a low, steady whistle, sounding almost like a wind blowing through a groove of some kind.  This happened more than once.  When one of my uncles investigated with a rifle one night while we were playing cards, he came back shaken and unable to explain why.  The night would be silent except for the whistle noise.",
