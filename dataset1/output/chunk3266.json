            "Observed": "My daughters, about 12 and 14 at the time, about 1977, were sitting on a small stone wall joining our patio in the backyard and I was up in the front yard. It was dusk, almost nightfall with very little daylight left. All of a sudden our three dogs ran down the gravel driveway from the front to the back of the house barking vigorously. I ran to the back of the house to find out what they were barking at. Here I encountered my two daughters; I asked them what the dogs were barking at. At this point in time there was no talk of a Bigfoot in Ohio, we never thought of anything being a Bigfoot. We had heard of a \"Sasquatch\" in the northwestern states but heard nothing of a Bigfoot in Ohio. My daughters told me that a large man ran right past them about 10 feet away running in a westerly direction. I said to them, \u0093Well when he runs into the barb wire fence, we will hear it.\u0094 The dogs at this time were still barking and had followed this man in the direction towards the fence. They then stopped barking and returned to us. We never heard the man hit the barbwire fence. (No yelling and cussing) The girls described to me that this man was very tall, had unusually long strides, and was running very fast, they also perceived that the man had a \"cape-like\" thing that was flowing out behind him as he ran.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Talking with the father and both of the daughters leads me to believe that the two sisters did in fact catch a glimpse of a Sasquatch. This has been a topic of conversation with their family for years and after much conversation, the \"cape\" has been determined to be long flowing hair which has been described in other Sasquatch reports. The property owner thought it was strange that his dogs didn't pursue the alleged runner through the fence which they were capable of, and is truly amazed that this runner went over the four foot high barb wired fence without any issues. They were amazed on the long strides and how quickly it covered the property to the fence line. When it initially ran past the two sisters, it was only 10 feet away and moving extremely fast. ",

The mountain rarely received any rain but always got considerable snow.  Some years glacial patches remained in shadowed areas throughout the summer.  Occasional streams were more often fed by snow melt than by springs.  The draw from which the call originated held one of these streams.  In some areas the soil remained fairly moist due to subsurface frost that persisted into late summer.  The North and East slopes of the mountain are almost bare of trees, the result of hydraulic mining in the late 1800's.  Where water was available, vegetation was plentiful.  Water and vegetation were both abundant in the draw.",
