We came upon an area where the stream split in two. There was a large rock on the \"island\" and next to it we found an odd looking impression in the mud. It was approximately 14 inches in length and roughly twice as wide as my steel toe boot. I have three photographs of it. One photo shows my boot next to it. I'm not sure if what I saw is anything. But the photos clearly show what looks to me like toes but I could just be wanting to see more than what is actually there. If you want copies of the photos, let me know.",

The location where the tracks were found is in a remote area at a natural gas well-drilling site. The area is rough terrain with a heavy forest and many coal mining sites.  He emailed me the photos, and I found them to be very interesting. The witness has also heard calls similiar to internet recordings of sasquatch in the past and has reported them to us. This area is close to where Report #26036 occurred.This is the photo including his boot for comparison.",
