Also, a \"Columbia River Gorge\" sign is mentioned which has not been verified near Boardman.The investigators have patiently waited for Mark's friend Charles O. to verify the sighting.  Until verification of location and time of day occurs, the investigators feel this report is less than stellar.   ",
