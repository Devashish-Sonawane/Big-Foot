            "Observed": "I don't know if this counts, but I talked to my grandfather the other day and he said he had gone up to our property in Monte Cristo. It was kind of late in the day, around 7 p.m. He usually does a perimeter walk of the property when he gets there and on this particular occasion, he had stopped down by the creek. He said he smelled this horrible smell that he had never smelled before. He described it as rotten meat and really bad B.O. He searched around the area and didn't see any tracks because the ground was really rocky. Where he was at, there is a big tree that has fallen over the creek. It's big enough for two people to walk over side by side. My grandfather hopped up on the tree and he said there were droppings right in the middle of it. He said he thought it might be elk droppings, but thought how on earth would an elk get up on this tree. When he told me the story, I told him that there was a bigfoot in his vicinity, that's where the smell was coming from. I read a lot of articles and a lot of people describe almost the same kind of smell. He also stated that our apple tree at the property doesn't have any apples on it anymore, and there are no chokecherries to be seen anymore. We usually have lots of apples and chokecherries. The deer and elk never eat them all. And the only apples they eat are the one's that fall on the ground. The rest are to high up the tree for them to get to. It would even be hard for a full grown moose to get the apples from the tree.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The report submitter discussed this incident and several others with me in a telephone interview. He does not currently live in the area because he serves in the Air Force and is stationed elsewhere. He was confident in the accounts given by his grandparents and thought them worth contributing to the public record but did not want any extra attention directed to the specific location of their or their neighbors' properties.He also mentioned that his grandfather had his dogs (a german shepherd and a border collie) with him at the time and that they were acting very apprehensive, which was very unusual for them.His grandmother's road-crossing sighting took place about twenty years ago and about five miles from their property. She described a very large, upright, dark-colored figure which appeared to cross the road in just two steps, only setting foot on the road once in the middle.Also near their property and about 15-20 years ago, near Limestone Springs, his grandfather saw what he thought was two little bear cubs, until they both stood up and ran away on two feet.The nearby Hardware Ranch, where he had heard of other occasional stories concerning possible bigfoot sightings over the years, is an elk refuge.David Petti",
