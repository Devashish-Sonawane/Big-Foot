Watching 2 geese with their babies, all of the sudden they all flew off and I started to get this really weird feeling like something was watching me. Turned around to walk back up the creek and heard a huge chrashing in the brush across from me and I stood still thinking it was a wild hog which has tried to attack me in the past. Started looking and couldn't get any really visible detail but saw what I am estimating as a 7 foot creature in the brush. I hollered at it and it backed up and completely dissapeared. Needless to say I got out of there.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness, a fisherman was fishing with worms for bass in Yellow Jacket Creek at dusk on May 24, 2012.  The creek flows through a heavily wooded and swampy area, and he likes to follow the creek deep into the woods to fish. He is always quiet when fishing, as the clear water in the creek is only 2 \u0096 3 feet deep.  He watched several geese about 10 yards from him become alarmed at something on the other side and suddenly fly away.  From across the creek, seconds later he heard a loud crash against a tree, then very heavy bipedal steps. The creek is about 35 feet wide and the sound came from almost directly across from him.Concerned it could be a hog; he looked through the trees and to his surprise saw a very tall and wide human-looking silhouette in the trees. It was too shadowed to see facial details, but he is sure that it was dark brown and not black. It stood about a foot taller than his height at 6 feet.  He knew by the size it was not another person. He cursed loudly at it to go away; and it backed up and \u0093disappeared\u0094 into the foliage. It didn\u0092t make any sound as it retreated. He quickly left, quite shaken with what he had seen.When retelling the story, the gentleman showed expected reactions to the encounter. It ranged from shock to fear. I found him very sincere in the retelling. He has returned to fish since the encounter. There is sandy soil which doesn\u0092t leave a good track but he continues to look. The witness has also heard many howling sounds and doesn\u0092t recognize them as coyote. They are much stronger but not necessarily louder and often followed by a growl. I asked him to listen to some recordings, and he claims the following sounds the most similar.Stan Courtney's Voice 17An older man that lives in the woods nearby has told stories of a bipedal creature he used to see around the creek. It was many years ago, but he used to refer to the \u0093ape-like\u0094 creature that ran on two legs, as \u0093No Neck,\u0094 on account that it seemed not to have one.  Attempts are being made to contact this man to hear his story first hand. This area is wooded, swampy and has a good supply of food to support sasquatch.  Another report from this county is Report #30135, and is about 13 miles away. ",
