            "Follow-Up Report": "I had the opportunity to follow up with the witness shortly after his report was submitted. We spoke by phone and I was able to get some additional details and information.At the time of his encounter he was with his family on vacation in the Panama City Beach area, and 17 years-old. The particular day of his encounter he and his family had taken a boat from a mainland beach area to Shell Island. This island, is a 7 mile long barrier island or peninsula, depending on the shifting sands, that lies between the waters of St Andrews Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. The western portion is part of St Andrews State Park, and the eastern part is part of Tyndale Air Force Base. It is an uninhabited pristine oasis, made up of sand dunes, coastal scrub forest, and pine hammocks. It is home to a variety of wildlife, including deer, rabbit, armadillo, alligator and sea turtles, to name a few. Though a popular destination for locals and tourists, it is virtually without amenities, concessions, restrooms or any other type of convenience, and practically everyone stays close to the beaches. The wooded areas stay mostly unbothered. The witness told me that he and his family were on the beach when he decided to venture up the dune, {or hill, as he described it}  toward the forest. He was just wanting to have a look at what lies up and beyond site of the beach. He said to me, the distance from the beach to the beginning of the forest, was approximately 100 yards. He also said that the beach is not visible form the forest line, nor the forest from the beach. Its only after you walk up the hill that the forest becomes visible. He said that once you are on top of the hill you would be clearly visible to anything that would be in the woods, though you would have great difficulty seeing them. Reason being, is the woods, as he described, were very thick only providing about 10 feet of visibility into them. It was as he approached these woods that he heard a loud animalistic sound. He said it sounded like a scream and screech in one. In his words, \"kind of like a hawk but different\". I asked him if he has been able to identify it since his encounter and he said he has not. He was approximately 7 yards from the beginning of the forest when he heard this loud scream. It got his attention very abruptly and he looked up and forward. Up to then he described his walk as casual with his head in a downward position, eyes looking more down than forward or ahead. Seems he was just strolling along toward the woods very unassumingly when he was caught of guard by this loud sound. I think there is a possibility the animal he encountered may have been unaware of his approach until he got quite close, then it emitted this scream. Another possibility is the witness was observed the entire time as he walked toward the woods, and only once he came too close, this animal screamed, as a warning, saying; ok that's far enough. Soon as the witness looked up after hearing the scream, he immediately saw what he described as a brown mass moving to his right through the woods. He only observed this animal for a second, and his immediate thought was; I probably need to run away or I'm going to die. He told me he did not feel threatened, it was rather the shock of seeing something he described as massive so close in front of him, that made him think; run! I asked if he could describe any distinct features, but he could not. He only said it was very large, massive, some type of animal or creature, and it moved quickly. We spoke about if it could be a bear, a wild hog or some other known animal, but he said it was not. In my search of animal life on Shell Island I did not read about bears or hogs inhabiting or having been seen on the island. Based on the witness' description of the creature, though brief, and the sound it made, I would feel confident in saying he very probably encountered what we commonly refer to as a bigfoot or sasquatch. In this area  they are also known as skunk apes.The witness did add that he told his family what he encountered when he ran back to the beach but they said he was crazy. This is not uncommon to get resistance from family and friends. It was not enough to dissuade this young man from being very clear to me concerning what he encountered.Please see the Shell Island article I provided, which lists the many food sources present in the area.

            "Observed": "February 2000 my wife Jean and myself went for a walk with our 2 Labs. Something got our attention to look out across a small lake with an Island on it. Crossing the frozen lake was a tall man like person walking at a fast pace. Body was dark in color, almost black. Head was a lighter color brown with hair coming down to his shoulders.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. I can add the following:He and his wife noticed the animal when it was about 350 yards away. It had rounded a point on the island and was walking North/Northeast on the lake, paralleling the island shore. It was walking on the ice, waist deep in cattails/reeds. As it angled into the island, it entered an area where the cattails were six feet tall (which came up to its upper chest, just below the shoulders). It then crossed to the island and disappeared into the trees.The entire sighting lasted less than three minutes. The closest the animal came to the witnesses was about 150 yards.  It covered a distance of approximately 300 yards during the duration of the sighting.  Immediately after the sighting, the witness went out on the lake alone and investigated the area where the animal had been. He found no prints in the hard ice pack.The animal was very large, standing between seven to eight feet in height. Its upper body was massive and extremely muscular. He never saw below its waist because it was always in the cattails and reeds. The cattails that it was walking though came up to the top of the witness's head, at six feet.  The animal's shoulders and head were visible when it was moving through those cattails.It was a very uniform black color, except for the long hair on its head that flowed onto its shoulders, which was brown. He estimated this hair to be six inches long.He could not see a neck; the head sat directly on the massively muscled shoulders. The face was the same color as the body. It turned at the waist to look at a pair of geese.It moved very fast. The witness said that there was no way he could have covered that distance at a walk the way it did. It was swinging its arms as it walked, but he never saw below its elbows. Its upper arms were long enough that the elbows and arms were hidden by the cattails.He was amazed by the effect it had on his dogs.  They are trained hunting dogs and spend a lot of time with him in the woods. When he went to check out the area, they would not go with him and retreated to the truck with his wife.I asked him about the local terrain. There are bogs and broken woodlands running for many miles to the north of the sighting location. The island and connecting bogs to the north would make a good habitat.The witness and his wife were obviously awestruck by what they had witnessed. His wife still doesn't like talking about it. He is certain that it was neither a human nor any other Minnesota mammal. It is my opinion that he is a very credible and honest witness.",
