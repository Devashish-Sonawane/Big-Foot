            "Observed": "Me and my brother was fishing in a local pond for bass on a john boat in the evening and we were just talking back and forth when this thing non human or not a bear bent over from the edge of the palmettos and stuck both hands in water and was drinking from its hands . It stared at us like it hadn't a care in the world . Eyes were dark looking had reddish brown hair that had a shine to it in the sun .Looked to be about 7' or taller . Had us pretty scared as my car was parked just 100 feet we had seen it . It never made a sound when it came in to drink and no sounds when it left . We hurried up and left there never to go back and didn't tell but a couple people in the past years. It is something that has no explaination so we just try to forget it . Never tried to harm us or make any contact but the thought of it still raises the hair on my neck. It had really large hands and it kinda sit on its legs when crouched down there was a musky odor like a deer in rut smell. Just happened so fast been hard to remember it only was there for a couple minutes after seeing us. Thank god.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the witness and his wife by phone. He has been a hunter and fisherman most of his life. He added in the phone conversation that he believes rocks were in their direction as they headed for shore. He and his brother hastily threw the john-boat into the hatchback as they fled. They observed it from about 60 yards as it crouched like a baseball catcher and drank from its large hands the way a human might do.  Hands and face were a dirty, leathery brown and its build was stocky with broad shoulders. Eyes were round and dark and looked at them as if it couldn't care less. Comparing it to the palmettos, the estimated height was at least 7 ft. They never returned to this pond that they fished quite often, full of bass and crappie. Very scared by this encounter, he does not feel lucky or fortunate to be a witness.",

            "Observed": "Me, my wife, and our 7 year old son were out for an evening bear hunt up to Coal Lake last night. We hadn't seen any sign of life at all the entire night covering several roads off mountain loop hwy, this was no exception. We stopped at the outhouse there at Coal Lake and walked up to the lake, at the time I thought it was weird that there was no wildlife at all. I mean none, no birds, nothing. After looking around a bit we got back in the truck and headed down the hill. We drove about 1/4 mile and found a small pile of scat in the road so I stopped to look at it, that's when I got a feeling that I was being watched. I went back to the truck and grabbed  my rifle and continued to look around. As I cleared the rear of the truck and approached the edge of the bank I started hearing some thrashing below me. I got excited thinking we found a bear but the longer we sat the less excited and more uneasy I got. The thrashing didn't move unless I moved. I worked my way down the road past the front of the truck trying to see what was making the noise but couldn't see it. I did get really nervous at this point because the thrashing followed me down the road. I have hunted elk and bear in Montana and Washington my whole life and never had one parallel the road with me nor be that close without growling. I was very well armed with a sidearm and a heavy magnum rifle but I had no interest in exploring this more. I don't know what it was, probably nothing, I do believe bigfoot is real however it never crossed my mind till my son told us that it was  not a bear it was Bigfoot.  But I can tell you it felt like my blood went cold.",
