            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness for thirty five minutes.  He filled in some details, which I have summarized below.  The incident occurred late at night after C.L. and his wife stopped to rest. They found a wide spot to pull off the side of I-90 outside Post Falls. Leaving the truck idling with lights on inside and out, they spent several minutes doing paperwork. C.L. then needed to relieve himself and he got out and walked to the front of the truck. A strange feeling of being watched came over him. When he lifted his head to look around, he locked eyes with a massive, hairy bi-pedal creature standing not more than ten to fifteen feet away.  C.L. was overwhelmed with the size of this human-like animal and retreated to the cab of his truck almost in a daze.  He found his wife as pale as a sheet.  She had watched the encounter through the front windshield.  They decided they could stay awake long enough to find another place to rest. Before they pulled back onto the road, they watched and heard the animal move back into the heavy undergrowth.C.L. said the animal was tall enough to look into the cab of the truck, which was about nine feet high.  Dark hair, two to three inches long, covered most of the body.  The face was dark skinned with a wide nose, thick lips and big, brown intelligent eyes.  The body was thick and muscular, resembling the female bigfoot in the well-known Patterson/Gimlin footage.  This creature had no visible ears or male or female body parts.  The arms were long and powerful, with human-like hands.  The thighs were enormous. Nothing in its behavior indicated aggression, though, and C.L. believes it was curious about his lighted, idling truck.  As the animal walked back into the forest, it had a smooth, unhurried gait.I found this witness to be credible. He is still quite moved by this encounter that occurred seventeen years ago.",
