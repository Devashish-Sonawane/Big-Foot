            "Follow-Up Report": "I followed up with a telephone interview to the witness and I have the following to add:The witness was wearing a ghillie suit, rubber boots and scent lock clothes while carrying a rag with deer urine on it.  The grass was waist to chest deep in the reclaimed mine area where he first encountered the two squatches.  In the dark, using a small flashlight, he thought he had jumped two bears and continued onto his hunting spot.It was only in the early daylight when he turned his body in reaction to a stick being thrown at him, he realized that he was looking at something that was not a bear.  Although it looked like an ape, he thought someone was pulling a prank on him.  The sasquatch had another stick in its hand and looked like it was winding up for another toss when he yelled the second time. The crouching figure went into a \u0093football stance\u0094 and started down after him. The hunter fired a shot in self-defense.  He did not aim at the creature, but in front of it as deterrence. The sasquatch immediately stopped the charge and retreated up the hill and away from him where it came to a halt.  The creature grunted as a possible signal, whereupon the smaller one came out of hiding to meet back up with the larger one.  The grunt was low, powerful and guttural.  The small one wailed as it ran, in a high pitch \u0093half woman scream and half baby crying\u0094 manner.  Once the two connected back up, they left the scene.  Being an open grassy area, the hunter did not hear them move, nor did they leave tracks.I believe that the witness had two interactions with the sasquatches.  The first was in the tall grass on the way to the hunting spot, and the second one at the hunting spot.  I believe that the sasquatches were confused by the ghillie suit and the lack of human scent.  I also believe that the sasquatches were checking him out on the boulder and threw a stick at him to see what he would do.The hunter witnessed a charge and communication between the two sasquatches.  One would assume that it was a false charge, but since it was broken up by his firing of the rifle I cannot say.  It was not bears.  Bears don\u0092t throw sticks.  The sasquatches did not yell or scream at him.  They did not knock on wood, nor did they clap their hands.  The only communication was when the large one wanted the small one to come up to where it was so they could leave together.",
