            "Observed": "About 0035hrs I woke up. I don't know if a sound awakened me or if I just woke up. {Light sleeper.} All was quite outside. From out at the edge of the field There was a howl unlike any I have ever heard. It was 5 seconds with about a 3 second pause and another burst for about 5 seconds. As soon as the sound quit, The dogs erupted in a howl. We have 14 sled dogs. During the spring we get beaver carcasses from some local trappers to cut up and feed to the dogs. The entrails and bad carcasses go out into the woods for animals and birds to eat.We have been doing this for five years. The day after the sounds I went out into the woods to look for tracks but did not find anything. Under a tree there were the stripped carcasses of three beavers and the skeletons were stacked all facing the same way. Could just be a coincidence. No further incidents this spring.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Several mysterious events happened here on that night back in the spring of 2001...  Three beaver carcasses were stacked up and there were no teeth marks on them. In other words, something pulled three carcasses, weighing approximately 60 pounds collectively, out of the general stack to eat them near a pine.  The carcasses were cleaned up and apparently the flesh was eaten... as it was missing.  Something howled in a gibberish sort of way twice.   Each vocalization was approximately five seconds long in duration.  The reactions of the dogs were comparable most to the reaction they give to bear, described as being intimidated,  but it was still different.   Plus the vocalizations in question were comparable in volume to the combined sound of all 14 sled dogs plus a half a dozen puppies... that is loud.   According to the witness, there was a similar sound on the internet,  yet somewhat different.   In addition, while in  a neighboring bottomland, he has felt somewhat uncomfortable for no particular reason.  This is a man who is a bear hunter and has taken them at close range.  Incidentally the substrate was grassy and there was no indication of a print or any other sign.  In the future, theland owner will be making an effort to validate any possiblesign or visits by anything unusual.",
