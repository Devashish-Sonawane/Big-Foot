E. doesn't believe in Bigfoot but he can't explain what it is he saw.He estimated the animals' weight at about 190 lbs. As it walked across the road at what looked like a 45 degree angle, not straight across, it had it's head down, as if cowering and maybe looking at it's feet or for something on the road. It had a short neck and the body did not look human to him.He first saw the animal at about 70 yards, in his rear view mirror, but by the time it re-entered the forested roadside, he was maybe 800 to 900 yards away. During the road crossing the animal didn't swing it's arms too much. He could see clearly that it was covered in fairly straight hair, maybe 4\" long. It took very long strides.He was really hoping that the other car would have seen this and stopped as well.",
