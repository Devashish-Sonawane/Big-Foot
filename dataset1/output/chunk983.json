            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness has participated in outdoor pursuits for over 40 years, sometimes spending a week at a time.   As a hunter, he has become adept at discerning the noise and sounds that wildlife and humans make in the woods.  When they stopped at the intersection and turned off their bikes, they removed their helmets.  The forest was silent. The witness has experienced that eerie feeling of total silence in the woods twice in his life.  Some know that feeling.  It\u0092s that kind of deafening silence that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up and gives you goosebumps.  This was the second of those two times.  The first time was in the same area, so the dirt bike rider\u0092s \u0093hackles\u0094 were up when they heard the knocks.They initially thought someone was messing with them but found no one there.  They estimated the distance to the knocks to be between 100 and 150 feet.  They weren\u0092t comfortable staying around after the witness hit a tree with a stick and they heard loud tree knocks in response.  The next day they spent time searching for any reason someone would be back in that thick forest but could find none.The witness has only told a few people of this encounter, without his dirt bike friends with him to back him up.  He has seen the disbelief others express.  However, when he told his stepfather, who spends more time in the woods than anyone else he knows, his stepfather told of an experience he had while hunting.  Back in the 70\u0092s, he came across a large nest. It stunk to high heaven and made his hair stand on end. The general location of this encounter has a history of Sasquatch reports, including sightings and what is thought to be typical Sasquatch behavior.  Under the circumstances, this investigator believes it is highly unlikely that a person created the tree knocks these dirt bike riders heard.  ",
