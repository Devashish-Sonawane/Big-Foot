They came from the east.\u2022  The screams were \u201cvery very loud.\u201d  When asked to quantify the volume, she compared it to a television that could be heard several houses away.\u2022  She described the sounds as a scream similar to a female human, but \u201cdeep and high-pitched\u201d in a way that no human could match.  \u2022  After the event, she asked a local ranger about what kind of animal could have possibly made the sounds.  The ranger didn\u2019t know.  ",
