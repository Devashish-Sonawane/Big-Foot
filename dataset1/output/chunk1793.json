As we got around a 90 degree turn in the stream, we both saw what at first was a bear with its paws in the water. As it saw us, it stood up and looked to be around 7', we both knew it was not a bear as we have hunted black bear. We dropped our fishing poles and stared. I have hunted and fished in the high lakes in Oregon for a lot of years but have not been back to this stream since. I think this creature was as scared of us as we were of it.",

The animal was on the opposite side of the creek and about 50' away. Their assumption was that the noise of the water covered up their quiet approach.The eye witness reports a muscular but not particularly massive animal. He commented repeatedly about its unusually long legs and the extremely long steps, about 6', that it took to reach the forest. It did not take its eyes off the fishermen for the entire encounter. Both witnesses retreated to their cars and moved their camp site about 30 miles away, but did not rest with the assurance that it couldn't catch up with them, given the rate at which they had observed it walking.
