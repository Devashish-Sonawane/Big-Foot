            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness about what he seen that day, which he remembers like it happened yesterday.  He was 17 years old when this occurred, and it 'scared the hell' out of him.  They were in this area around dusk, and there was still enough light to see without using a flashlight.   The witness' view was behind and to the right a little. The creature was in a position that resembled a football lineman - bent over with hands and feet touching the ground, but not the knees.  The right arm and right foot were more forward than the left arm and foot, respectively.  He had the impression it was looking at something and it never looked toward him when he saw it.  He did not hear the creature move off after he ran away from it.  He described it as lanky and thin, taller than 6 ft - 'a thin, hairy basketball player'.   According to the witness, it was too tall and thin, and its arms and legs too long, to be a bear.His friend seemed to notice he was shaken up about something, but the witness didn't know what to say to him, so he kept quiet.  Though he was frightened, he and his friend stayed in that area for another hour or so, and nothing else was noticed that night.This area is right on the Mississippi River, and at the time of the sighting the reeds and brush along this quarry were around 4-5 ft tall.  He has only told this story to one other person, and decided to submit his report after seeing other reports on the BFRO website.",
