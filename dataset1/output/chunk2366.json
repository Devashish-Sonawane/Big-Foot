            "Observed": "I was in Junior high school for Crewe Junior High (no longer exists). I was riding on a school bus on a back road in Greensville Co. Virginia after competing in a junior high school basketball game with my teammates. We had lost the game so my coach had told everyone on the bus ride he wanted no talking on the ride home back to Nottoway Co. Well almost everyone on the bus was sleep or trying to go to sleep cause we could not talk. That is when I saw it. About 75 to 100 yards away from the road down a hill was a corn field with a scarecrow on a wooden cross in the middle of it. I saw out of the foggy window cause it was early winter a huge figure standing like a man with hair all over it. I could tell it had hair because it was thick and long from under it's arms. It had to be about 8 to 9 foot tall because it's head was at the chest area of the scarecrow on the wooden cross. It was huge and massive. It appeared to be looking at the scarecrow. As the bus drove by I sat up in the seat to try to get a better look out the window because I had the window cracked to get some air. I yelled at my coach and everyone on the bus \"did you see that?\". They all laughed and joked on me. I tried to get my coach to turn around to go back. He was so mad at the team for losing the game he told everyone to be quiet and not say another word or we would be running laps the next day. So I did not say anything else. What I saw that night has haunted me for a long time until today when I got a text message from my brother about an article he read from you guys about Big Foot sightings in Nottoway and Brunswick counties. My brother knows of the story I have told and wanted me to know that I was not the only one to have seen something like this in my hometown area. I live in Midlothian, Va now but its only 45 minutes from Nottoway Va. where  the story of the Fort Pickett sighting my brother read happened and 1 hour 30 minutes from Greensville Va.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After conversing with the witness, the following information can be added to his report:-It was the winter of 1980, the witness was in the 9th grade. The school bus passed about 75 to 100 yards away from the figure which stood in a corn field a little below road level. The night was bright and clear, and the witness could see very well. He was able to observe the creature for 7 to 8 seconds.-The creature stood in a small clearing in the corn field staring up at the scarecrow that had been mounted to a wooden cross. The scarecrow would have probably been 10 feet high, as was typical in that area, and it stood only a foot or more taller than the figure.-Looking down from the bus the witness could see the creature's entire body. The arms hung away from its torso somewhat, so that he could see long hair hanging from them. It had long legs and wide hips, but given its tremendous height the overall appearance was slender and not bulky.-He could not clearly make out the face at that distance but could see that its head was large and its chest was broad. The face and head had a lot of long hair around it, which looked wild and unkempt, not groomed as a bear's hair will often appear. The hair on this creature did not lay all in one direction, but appeared to stick out in various directions.-The witness compared its size to a 7' 7\" tall man he once saw and he felt this creature would have dwarfed that man. Having worked on farms the witness was very familiar with the typical height of local corn and tobacco crops, and how high scarecrows were often mounted.-The BFRO reports of activity in nearby areas prompted the witness to submit his report. He was spooked by the sighting and after many years of wondering about what he saw, these same reports have given him solace that he's not alone in his experience from that part of rural Virginia.-The witness spoke with a relative who drives a bus on this same route today. Together they worked out the general location of this sighting as taking place along Route 46, Brunswick road,  between Nottoway and Lawrenceville in Brunswick County, and not in Greensville County as previously reported.-The BFRO reports from this area to which the witness refers include 31648, 33256 and 29305.",
