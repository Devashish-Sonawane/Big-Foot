My 12 year old daughter and I picked up my son (age 18) at Dulles International Airport (Virginia) at 9:45 pm and proceeded south on Route 28.  My daughter was riding in the front seat; my son rode in the back seat. I became disoriented and missed our turn.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After talking to the witness for more than an hour two different times, I do believe that she is a credible witness. She is a school teacher in VA. This is a photo of the ditch where the animal was seen crouched and bent over next to the road in front of the church.I talked to the pastor of the church and he told me that there was a car accident prior to this incident. The accident took out several telephone poles and several trees. The pastor removed one of the trees a few days after the car accident and took it across the road to a property that the church has.  The pastor took me over to the field to show me where the tree was placed. I found possible old shelters or blinds and this arched tree that was pinned by a large rock. I do believe that this is a good hunting area for a large animal due to the large number of deer and fresh water ponds in the area.  After checking with Virginia Game and Inland Fisheries, they verified that there are no brown bears in Virginia. The pastor asked me not to make the location and the church name public. This is an on-going investigation with the cooperation of the pastor and local residents. These are quick sketches of the figure seen in the ditch that evening, the 1st one drawn by the mother and the 2nd by the daughter.",

            "Observed": "Went for a weekend hiking and camping trip with 4 family members.  We hiked about a mile and a half down an established trail before making a turn into the brush to find our camping spot just after sunset on the first night.  we probably hiked about 400 yards into the brush before setting up camp and turning in for the night as it began to rain.  I was woken up about 4:30am by a very strong odor that smelled just like a skunk, so much so that I assumed a skunk had made it into our camp and I zipped up the shell on my sleeping bag to avoid being sprayed.  The odor went away so I relaxed a bit more and tried to get back to sleep when I smelled it again only this time I had an overwhelming feeling I was being watched from directly behind me.  I rolled over to look and was able to make out a sillouette of a very broad shouldered shadow and head between two trees about 7 yards from where I was laying.  I immediately turned around and waited for daybreak, still unsure if I had seen anything or just imagined it I sat waiting and listening for anything aggressive in nature and it didn't happen so I chaulked it up to an overactive imagination but was still uneasy about staying in this location.  I said nothing to my family but I was determined to not let the camp fire die out on the second night.  The second night came and it rained again, we could hear the sound of what I would describe as a very loud owl.  We turned in for the night and all my family fast asleep let the fire get to the verge of dying, easily helped by the falling rain.  Sounds were all around the campsite but not really unexpected in a dry rotting forrest during some steady rains.  I got up to tend the fire and as the firelight grew it seemed the forrest sounds intensified, again probably just nerves.  I'm not an avid outdoorsman but I love the minor amount of time I do get to spend in the wilds.  It was about 3:30am at this time and one of my family members woke up and helped me with the fire, sensing my uneasyness he suggested I use his hammock to get some rest and he would watch the fire.  I got a couple hours sleep and woke up around 5:30am still before daybreak and my family member proceeded to tell me that about 15 minutes prior he heard a very loud crash in the forest and then another less intense crash directly behind the hammock where I was then sleeping.  It had alarmed him enough that he had his handgun out and ready but he said he didn't see anything and I still didn't say a word about what I thought I may have seen the night prior.  I actually did not tell anyone until we were on our way home and I told my brother about what I thought I saw, mostly out of fear of ridicule.  It wasn't until we got home and I started doing some research that I became more convinced of what I think I saw on the first night and what I smelled.  During our time at this campsite the rain stopped during the day and we were able to hike around the area probably covering almost 2 miles and one of things that struck us was the complete lack of any wildlife.  We saw a woodpecker and heard the sounds of birds chirping on the first morning, but that was it, nothing not a single rabbit, squirrel, dear, bird or anything other than that woodpecker and a few fish in a nearby creek were seen in the area.  We did come across some animal droppings that looked almost like rabbit droppings only smoother.  We only stayed two nights even though we had planned on 4 nights total, fearing more rain we left early.",
