            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness and his wife go walking in the early mornings daily. One nice calm morning around 6:30 am they were walking and they heard a whack sound and then after about four seconds heard a second whack sound. He looked to his wife and said what was that and her reply was I don\u0092t know.  The terrain is woods, small creeks, farm land and deer can be seen walking down the gravel road.  Located in the same area as the Cardinal MarshHe was down at his neighbors, and asked if the neighbor had heard anything like a whack sound on a tree or wood.  Neighbor said yes that it had sounded really close to the property and was really loud in about the same area as they were walking.He has hunted with a bow for many years and never seen anything unusual or smelled anything out of the ordinary, or heard that sound before. They have heard of several Bigfoot sightings in the Cardinal Marsh Wildlife Area. ",

            "Observed": "It was dark at the time. I was living on a road surrounded by woods. I went out to take my dog for a walk. Our driveway connected to a dirt road that ran up the side from the main rd. We walked to the end of the dirt road and along that road is a tree lining of woods. As we started heading back I looked over a noticed a tall figure staring at me at the edge of the woods. I couldn\u0092t make out what it was. It was definitely taller than 7ft and stood on two legs. It had orangish eyes. I started walking back down the road towards my house and when I would stop it would stop an look at me. I would walk some more, so would the thing and then once I stopped it stopped and would look at me. At this point I was really freaked out so I yelled for my dog to run and we sprinted towards the house. When I finally got inside I looked down our driveway and across the road at the tree line and the figure was there still staring at me. I told my father but when he looked he saw nothing.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, Michelle Goodwin, by phone.  She was a teenager at the time of the incident. She no longer lives in the house mentioned in the report. She says the area now has many more houses than back in 2000. Tanglewood Road has been extended as well.She said the figure was a silhouette but definitely not a bear because it was simply too tall and walked on two legs the entire time it paralleled her. It was not more than 5-6 feet into the woods from the side of the roadI asked about the eyes and whether they appeared to be glowing or just reflecting light. She said the eyes seemed to be glowing dimly (which is a common feature of many night time encounters). The color was somewhere between orange and yellow.  Although she became more frightenned as the stalking continued she said the figure was not otherwise aggressive or hostile. She knew very little about the sasquatch/bigfoot subject at the time. It was many years later that she learned more and realized the figure that paralleled her that night was likely one of these creatures, by process of elimination.",
