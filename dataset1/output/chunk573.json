This creature was about the size of a 10 year old child and resembled an ape. I swerved to miss the creature, and was stunned about what I just saw. My roommate was with me and confirmed she had seen the same thing. We looked back to see if the creature was still there, and there was nothing. I was a non-believer until this incident.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with both the driver and passenger (roommate listed) separately by phone.  Both were adamant that what they saw that night \u0093looked like a monkey or gorilla\u0094.  At one point the driver saw the creature raise it\u0092s arm above it\u0092s head for a moment before lowering it.  She described the length of the arm as \u0093long\u0094 with long \u0093coarse hair\u0085like a horse\u0092s tail\u0094.The driver told me that as she realized she was not looking at a known animal in front of them on the bridge, exclaimed aloud in the car \u0093monkeys don\u0092t live here!\u0094.  It never ran from their oncoming car but instead held it\u0092s ground crouched in the opposite lane of the long bridge as they passed.The driver described the creature\u0092s overall hair as \u0093really long\u0094 and the color as \u0093light brown\u0094 or \u0093brownish gray\u0094.  She noted that the gray color that she remembered was on the upper forearm and may have been a result of the car\u0092s headlights.  The passenger described the creature several times as \u0093really, really hairy!\u0094 and light brown in color.The driver was focused on driving the car across the bridge and was unable to remember facial features.  The passenger described the face as having little to no hair, \u0093large eyes\u0094 and a \u0093button nose\u0094 that was \u0093short and stubby\u0094.There have been multiple reports in this area.  Crossing this bridge would save you from getting cold and wet if you needed to cross the North Fork of the Toutle River.",
