            "Observed": "I grew up in Boulder County, my parents quit farming in NE and moved to Longmont in 1960. During the summer, we would go up Big Thompson Canyon or the St. Vrain to camp and picnic. In the summer of 1964, we were picnicking along the St. Vrain stream. We had started a campfire, you could do that then, and while I was looking for wood, I felt like I was being stared at. I looked up, and at the top of a sheer rock wall about thirty feet up, I saw him. I can see him like yesterday. He was looking at me and as soon as I saw him he turned and left. He was very large probably eight feet tall and had long greying hair. His face was darker and did almost look human. No one believed me of course, but I can still see his eyes looking at me before he turned. So I have always believed in their existence.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After speaking with the witness on the phone we were able to get a more accurate location of this sighting which was along the South Saint Vrain River canyon off of highway 7 from Lyons, Colorado near the Big Narrows. Verdell lives in Nebraska but remembers the events of that day like it was yesterday even though these events happened nearly forty-four years ago.   He was walking by himself looking for firewood and throwing rocks into the water off the St. Vrain River near the Big Narrows while his family was enjoying a picnic nearby. He then got an unusual feeling he was being watched and looked up at the canyon wall that was in front of him on the other side of the river. It was then that he saw what he describes as a large, possibly eight-foot tall, hair covered, man-like creature standing on a rocky ledge about fifty feet higher than he was.  It seemed as startled as he was when they saw each other. It then turned and disappeared from his view.  He described it as having mostly white/gray colored hair with streaks of brown. Its overall body seemed to be \"well-built\" like that of a football player.  The hair was about three to four inches in length uniformly over the body with the exception of the hair on the head which seemed a bit longer and flowed down the sides of its head like a person with the hair parted on the top.The face looked human like, with some gorilla features but was nearly hairless and described as having dark-colored grayish skin.  He could not see any eye color  but its mouth seemed very wide. The entire encounter lasted nearly thirty seconds, then it was gone.  ",
