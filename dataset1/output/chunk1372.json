            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness by phone and have the following to add to his report:- The area contains tracts of woodland (some quite large), farmland, swamps, a small town, streams and a few lakes.It was completely dark by the time the witness returned to the fire with the second load.- The witness describes the animal he saw near the woods as being between seven and eight feet tall, as estimated on a tree it passed by (he has been back to this spot on numerous occasions since the sighting). The animal moved \u0093like a football player going through the tires\u0094 likely due to the tussocks in the area. - One thing he forgot to mention in his report is that, as they were throwing the last load on the fire, he also briefly saw the head and shoulders of another animal peek out at them from behind an old trailer that was parked on the site near the woods about seventy yards from them. He noted the head as being tall without a neck. This glimpse was very brief as it quickly ducked back behind the trailer.- He did not see any details of the animals, only their silhouettes. - It is possible that the two young men were being pranked by local boys, but I find that unlikely as the animals moved around them in complete darkness with ease and speed, even through the woods, despite the area beyond the fire being completely dark.- In the interim, he has noticed a few other things out of place in the area from time to time. Occasionally, his mother's dog is too frightened to go out to the woods with him, which is strange behavior for this dog. Other dogs in the area have gone missing or been found killed with broken bones. Recently, the witness and a friend found a three inch diameter tree near his new hunting stand twisted off and down. They cannot figure out how it could have happened naturally in the deep woods with no other trees having been damaged in the area.I found this witness to be very credible. He has a degree in Natural Science and was very knowledgeable about animal behavior and the animals of the local area.",

            "Also Noticed": "Well, when I saw its eyes, they were too far away from each other, like an ape, and its shoulders were wider than the window. I backed up from the window and said to my brothers girlfriend that's not Donald. It looks like a big ape. She told me to stand still and it will go away. Well we stood there for about 2 or 3 mins. And then it turned to the east and walked away. It stood and passed 3/4 of the window. It had a point to its head and realy hairy. Then 30 mins. later when my brother showed up, we told him what happened. At first he didnt believe us until he found some footprints behind the house. I was 13 at the time. Now, I'm 35yrs. old . And we didn't know who to call back then. That's why I'm telling you now.",

            "Observed": "I and my family live on the north side of Ennis on I-45. At the time, I was 13 yrs old. I was at home with my brother's girlfriend. We were there alone. She was giving me a tattoo on my left arm of a cross. We were sitting at the dining room table. I was looking out the dining room window, looking at the gas station behind my house. Then we heard something at the little kitchen window. We thought it was my brother playing a trick on us, so we got up to see if it was him. But we didn't see anything, so we went back to the table. When I went to look out the window again, there was someone standing at the window. I thought it was my brother so I got up and showed my arm to it, thinking it was my brother. Well then it stood up. Then I went to the window thinking my brother was standing on something. Why I say that is because the bottom of the window was 4 and a half feet from the ground and my brother is 5 foot 11 inches tall. So I looked out the window, and it looked at me. I was about 6 inches from its face. I saw its eyes then.",
