We walked about one mile when my friend Russ looked at me and asked if I felt like some one was watching us. I replied \"I feel the same way\". At first we just thought it was some kids or a game warden, but when we called out no one answered. We decided to turn back. As we started walking back the feeling got stronger. We got to my truck at a dead run, then we noticed trees moving behind us. We got my mag light out of the truck and started looking at the tree line. We were parked about two hundred yards off the road, in a half circle of trees with an open field behind us.",
