            "Observed": "I was staying at the Marriott hotel 6th floor in Huntsville Alabama at the Space and Rocket Center-At 5:40am on Feb 24th 2009 I went on the balcony to drink my coffee as the room was too stuffy and hot.  I was out there just thinking and staring off at the woods when something caught my eye--after refocusing on it I realized there were legs, then arms, then I could clearly make out his face.  The creature stood 6-7ft tall and was staring directly back at me-it seemed to have fine hairs all over -grey color hair that got more black as the hair got closer to the skin--the tips of the hair were much lighter--the face (lips, eye lids, etc) were more of a very dark brown-it stood very erect, was very muscular, and did not seem to have the apelike protruding mouth and nose but more flat faced human like--after 30 seconds he started rocking back and forth--I then realized this was moving and could in no way be mistaken for a dear or bear or anything else--this was a fully erect apelike animal that seemed to want me see him --he was rocking back and forth from side to side.  After the initial 30 seconds he rocked for about 10-12 seconds then stood and stared at me --I was on the 6th floor about 120 yards away in decent lighting due to hotel lights and street light behind loading area of hotel-he then would stare back then he would remain face forward with feet only about 2 feet apart would lean over to his left with his right arm would start pulling bark off a very large pine tree--it looked as if someone were in a sawing position--then he would stand up stare at me then rock and then pull bark--this was done in that order 3 times over a 5-6 minute period--after five minutes of re-verifying what I was looking at I felt this creature was docile and smooth moving--I decided I would try and get a closer look--as I opened the sliding glass door he stared and I stared back--I ran out of the hotel room and there was security in our hall laying the morning news at the hotel room doors--I asked him to come with me and asked for back up since he had no gun--we ran around the corner outside - as we were running I Finally got the nerves to tell them what I saw--we get to the reference points I had chosen and there were a lot of fresh bark removed from the large pine tree--I tried to pull bark from it to no avail -- it was too hard--I am 6'4\" 300 lbs.  I went back after 7am (light) -- I did notice what looked like scat --it took the form of explosive diarrhea and looked like a hundred birds had pooped in a small area--like in a shotgun pattern-heavy in the middle and lighter to the outside perimeter-I put a large handful in a Marriott laundry plastic bag--It looks like feces and digested berries and seeds. (It was dry although it had rained the night before)  One of the Marriott employee's saw two large footprints --more like deep indention's in the pine straw--I took off my shoe and placed my foot in it and there was about a one inch area all the way around my foot in order to fill the indention--Something very heavy had to make these indention's--I tried and I am 300lbs and could not.  I am 100% positive of the above discription--I watched this clearly for 5-6 minutes!",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness has requested to remain anonymous. He has never followed the Bigfoot phenomenon and has always felt people were more than likely misidentifying other animals in his words. His report was consistent with what he described to me over the phone. He was very excited about the whole ordeal and couldn't get over the fact that he witnessed something that is not supposed to exist. I do not feel the scat specimen was related it was very \"bird like\" in appearance. Unfortunately the sample was not in its original state over 2 weeks later. I was impressed that he took the time to get the sample to see if it was related. There is still an active investigation with this sighting and I will make updates accordingly. UpdateI spoke with *** who is the second shift manager at the hotel. He said that the guest who had the sighting came down to the lobby in the early morning of Feb. 24th and asked the security guard to accompany him outside. He also asked if he had backup and a weapon, just as he said in the report above. He also verified the bark missing on the tree and the impressions. He stated that surrounding the hotel grounds are nature trails and a large deer population. He also said that it was only 100ft from the back of the hotel to the area of the sighting. He has heard of no other sightings in the area.",
