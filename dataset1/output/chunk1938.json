I need to know if this is evidence of proximity to the Sasquatch. I live just outside the old Weyerhauser Tree Farm in Snoqualmie Valley and spend alot of time taking early morning walks there with my dog to take pictures.",

The witness noted two separate incidents that occurred in the autumn of 2004, and the witness was able to elaborate on several aspects. Namely, 1) that the thumps that he had heard sounded like a large baseball bat hitting a tree, or perhaps a very large log or stick hitting a tree; 2) that the thumps were approximately 300 yards apart, and seemed to be in response to each other; and 3) that the two vocalizations that he heard were like short barking hoots that sounded tentative, and were flanked by the two knocks, giving him the impression that the hoots and the thumps were related to each other.  The witness was positive that the thumps were not woodpeckers or grouse, and he had never heard calls that were similar to these vocalizations.  This area is surrounded by remote forest and continues to be an area of interest and research. ",
