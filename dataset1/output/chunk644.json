            "Follow-Up Report": "Primary BFRO Investigator: Tommy McElyeaBelow is a description of the incident by the other witness, T.B. :It all happened on a late july night in 1999.We were fishing holt lake near tuscaloosa,about 10 or 11 o'clock we were fishing a long stretch of the shore where the nearest house is about 2-3 miles from where we were at.We were sitting about 25ft of the bank in J.F.'s boat when we heard something coming down the hill towards us.I stopped fishing and just started looking thinking that i might get to see a deer come down to the water to drink.As I stared up into the woods it kept getting closer to us and we could hear 2 distinct footsteps and they sounded pretty heavy.Both J. and myself are avid outdoorsmen we spend our spare time hunting or fishing or trying to improve our hunting and fishing sites,so we can pretty much distinguish between a deer or other four legged animal and a two legged one.As this thing got closer we decided to move to another spot while we were getting ready we moved away from the bank and it sped up and kept getting closer by the time we were ready to go it was already on top of us so to speek.when we sat down in our seats to go J. was trying to crank the motor and we heard it jump in the water and let out a strange growling roaring sound that I had never before and never since heard.I did hear a sound that came real darn close on your website I believe.",

There was a lot of wind damage to the structure and the forest by the time I saw it in person.  We found impressions in the forest floor measuring 15\" long and 5 1/2\" wide with a 4ft. stride.  Almost the same measurements as the footprint in the video.   This general area is considered by many BFRO members to be a particularly reliable zone for sasquatch activity. A few BFRO members return to this area periodically. Consequently, this report was not posted immediately, per the request of those field investigators. Although this area will not be the focus of the 2009 expedition, it will be held close enough to allow some participants to spend a day or two there.  Although the swampy, rooty terrain prevents deep penetration into the woods, especially in the dark, the sasquatch-related sounds heard in the heart of this area are among the most reliable in the state of Florida.",
