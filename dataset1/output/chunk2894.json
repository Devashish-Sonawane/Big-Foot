AS I SLOWED DOWN FOR THE STOP SIGN I LOOKED IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR AND IT WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD LOOKING AT ME. SORRY, DIDN'T STOP. CALLED MY FIANCE AT THE TIME (NOW MY HUBBY) AND WAS HISTERICAL. HE CALLED THE STATE PATROL AND THE DISPATCH SAID...THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME WE HAD A BIGFOOT REPORT. THIS THING WAS AT LEAST 6 TO 7 FEET TALL AND DARK. ALL I SAW WAS EYES ON TOP OF THIS MASSIVE BODY. SCARED THE HECK OUT OF ME. JUST ASK MY HUBBY.",

She stated over and over that the animal looked directly into her eyes through her side window and was not a man in a suit.  The gait of the animal coming out of the ditch was also extraordinary and would be difficult if not impossible for a human to duplicate.Unfortunately the sighting was brief and she was unable to provide more detail.",
