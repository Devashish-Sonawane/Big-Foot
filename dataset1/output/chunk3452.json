            "Follow-Up Report": "Virginia Louise (Swanson) - a retired veterinarian, spoke openly with friends and Bigfoot researchers many times by phone. She was a very sharp woman. Given her age and mental acuity, (She was 90) she was still bright and right on the money with mental tasking and physical abilities. Just before she died she was driving a bulldozer in an effort to plow a road to her new house. She even prospected for gold in her spare time. The following story is her account of the Bigfoot creatures seen in the back country of San Diego County, California. While her story appears incomplete, it should be of interest to San Diegans if not Southern Californians.Note: It is believed that Virginia Louise did make it back to the area several times before she moved to her late husband's mining claim in central California. She died not long after her move. In all subsequent instances her efforts in the Lagunas were stymied by the local Native Americans. Her book, \"The Night-Side of Gold\" is out of print. Perhaps she published it herself to give copies to interested people.Credit Source:  This information was provided by bigfoot researcher Peter Guttilla.",

            "Observed": "I don't know if this is of interest, but way back in 1970 while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail north of  Hoodoo ski area, something happened that I will never forget.  I was with three friends on a hiking trip.  When it was time to hit the sack, around 11 pm, we all got into a small wall tent.  All of us were in sleeping bags, ready to go to sleep.  Then we heard heavy footsteps.  They sounded like a man walking.  Who or whatever circled our tent three times, brushing up against  the tent without tripping over the ropes holding up the sides of the tent.  It was very dark  outside. We saw no light  from a flashlight.  We thought \"How can a guy walk around the tent without a light\"?  By the way, I do not think there was anyone camped within miles of us.  Needless to say, this scared the heck out of us.  We did not get out of the tent to look around- too scared.  We were all only 15 years old at the time!  That's it.. Not much there, but it is all",
            "foot size.2": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "The boys had had a campfire for the evening, but had extinguished it before retiring. They, specifically the witness, had an instant recognition that the footfalls were not from a person, a feeling reinforced not only by the heaviness of the steps, but also by its nocturnal behavior. They could not tell whether the tent was touched by a hand or a foot. The witness estimates that they hiked about 10 miles per day, putting them in the vicinity of Hunt's Cove to the SW of Mt. Jefferson. The terrain remains roughly the same, even if the locale was farther south from that indicated here.",
