            "Observed": "me and a friend were gathering cattle around dusk about 300 yards from the river.  We were pusing the cattle towards the barn which was about a mile from our locataion at the time.  as we pushed the cattle we noticed our horses becoming ancy and they wanted to go the opposite way of the river and the cattle were becoming hard to hold togeather and they were getting ancy as well and nervous.  we decided that it was a lost cause because for some reason they were frightend.  we just thought it was becasue a storm was on its way and cattle gather in a corner before and during a storm.  and it was getting dark so we headed in and angrily decided to do it in the morning.  as we headed home our horses would not go and we figured that they were nervous from the oncoming storm.  as we impatiently loped them towards the river my buddies horse took off on a dead run for the barn, soon after that mine fallowed.  as we got to the sandy bank of the Canadian river we saw a bigfoot standing there about 100 yards down river from us.  he was sqwating on the side of the river and when we came up he was startled and jumped to his feet, but didnt run off.  the horses stoped with alot of pulling back on the rains and becasue they didnt want to hit the river with a full head of steam.  they were very nerous though, prancing in circles around each other.  but we still got a good look. at first we were very startled but we didnt run out of curiosity and shock i think.  we watched it watch us for about 30 seconds i think before it hauled as into the trees.  it ran with a gate that i have never seen and it was not human at all, it was about 9 feet tall and its strides were about that long.  as it ran with its head towards us it just clobered a small tree right at the edge of tree line, as it did the tree broke and the bigfoot barely flinched.  this was when we both knew that it was not human at all.  we didnt have the balls to check things out that night but we did go back the next morning, but we couldnt tell much because of the rain that night.  but to this day i swear by my story and i swear that whatever that thing was it was no human",

            "Observed": "When I was living in Brixey, Missouri I lived out in the country. We had woods all around us and the houses were all spaced out. We had a good size pond in our yard and a lot of deer and other animals came through to drink from the pond. One night me and my now ex-husband were asleep. It was the middle of the night when I was woken up by the sound of my rabbit that was in a big dog kennel on the porch that was covered, to keep the rabbit from the cold. The kennel was right outside the front door and under a window.  Where my bed was I had a clear view of the front door and the window. When I woke there was a big dark figure in the window. It looked big and hairy. I don't know what it was but I do know it was not a dog, coyote, a deer or a bear. My two dogs that I had there, that I still have, will bark at everything, but didn't bark. One was laying on the sofa like she was trying to hide, something she has never done before and hasn't done since that night. I now live in Texas and I would really like to know if you guys have ever got reports out of Missouri or if I'm the first one. I don't know what it was for sure but I think it was a Bigfoot.",
