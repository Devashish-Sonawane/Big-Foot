            "Observed": "I was driving home with my baby girl late after visiting her grandma one July night, I think it was the 4th of July weekend. I was coming up on a corner with a guardrail to my right, there is a gully with a creek at the bottom, and a telephone pole about 3 feet from the end of that, I was going 35 mph. When I was almost arond this corner my lights started hitting something that I thought was a telephone pole or a guardrail at first but I knew that it was something crouched down on the last cement guardrail post as I got closer. When I got closer the thing stood up from almost sitting on it's heels and jumped into the middle of my lane and threw it's hands up in the air, I'm thinking about 8' total from a crouching position, I think trying to make itself look bigger. I think it was only around 7 feet tall, it didn't seem that much bigger than my stepdad and brothers who are 6'2\"-6'4\". I was so shocked, I could not believe what I was looking at, totally stunned. It was all black and definately not a bear, I've seen a black bear and it was definately not that. It's arms stretched high like a man's not like a bear and I didn't see a longer nose like a black bear has, it was like a man not a dog's face. I think as soon as it realized I wasn't stopping it laid down on the road right in front of me and I ran over it with my little Honda Civic sedan. My drivers side tires went over its head and it was a very loud boom boom as I rode over it with all four tires. I immediately started thinking about stopping and seeing if it was still alive but all I could think is that if I got out it might come after me and then my daughter woudln't have me anymore. I thought what if it did damage to my car and I got stuck out there with it and my baby. I cried the whole way home thinking I had just killed the only Bigfoot there was, and still there is no doubt that's what I saw. When I got home my family had left a note saying that they had gone up to Canada to go to a wave pool and there was no way to get a hold of them so I thought about what I should do for about half an hour or so. I put my daughter in bed right away. I decided to call 911 and tell them that I had hit a bear and I was worried that it was injured and would go after some of the young children who lived down a private driveway just across from where I hit it. I said I was also worried that it might cause an accident because it was in the road if it was dead. I wanted them to find it on the road, I wanted someone to discover it so I wouldn't seem crazy. As soon as I got off the phone with 911 I went out to the car to see what the damage was to my car. Amazingly I only noticed one thing, my license plate holder with the dealership's name was broken in half and the bottom half was gone and the whole license plate was bent under the car. I bent it back and noticed some hair hanging from the license plate bolt. My dogs were circling and circling the car and wouldn't leave it alone. I grabbed the hair and thought maybe it would help if I got the hair off the car. I was thinking the whole time I was throwing the hair into our garbage that I should maybe keep it but decided against it because I figured that no one would believe me anyways, my lab mix's hair was very similar in color, DNA testing was announced on the news only months later, can you imagine how mad I was that I didn't keep it. It was dark brown with sort of reddish highlights to it. It was wirey feeling. When my family got home they did not believe me, my brothers to this day still tease me a little about it. I thought there was only one way to prove to my brothers and parents that I wasn't crazy, call 911 and check out what had come of my call. When I called them the next day they had no record of my call, even after I told them the exact time of my phone call they couldn't find it. So I decided to take one of my brothers with me to the place where I hit it and show him the evidence on the road, surely there would be some left over from the night before. There was nothing on the road, no hair, no blood, no nothing. I just realized a couple months back there should of been one thing for sure, the other half of my license plate holder but it wasn't there. I looked everywhere but I didn't spot anything. It hadn't rained, it hadn't even been 10 hours later on a very lightly driven road, at the time. My brother thought I was insane. I've only told a few of my close friends and family over the years but only a few even think that what happened to me is possible, most of them just think I'm telling a joke. I sometimes hear the cry late at night that could only be a Bigfoot but I haven't seen one again. The only reason why I'm coming forward now is because I never knew there was any organization for this sort of thing and I want my brothers to apologize for teasing me for all these years, I won't be holding my breath though. Thanks for reading this, I appreciate it. I'm sorry my sighting was so long ago but I hope others may have seen something in this region more recently.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness is a 35 year old homemaker with an associate degree in mechanical engineering. She still lives in the area and drives the South Pass Road often. I met with her in the town of Everson and proceeded to the exact location of the incident. As the witness pointed out the details at the location I took photos of the scene. The witness did not hesitate in her accounts of what took place, never changing her description of what happen to her 17 years ago. I found her to be very pleasant, forthcoming and detail oriented.What I can add to her account is that later after much thought, she really felt that the creature waved it's arms in the air and laid down in front of her car, to try to get her to stop. At the very moment the incident started she really felt it was a person in a suit pulling a prank on her. But she quickly became concerned about possible danger and feared for her child in the backseat, so she was reluctant to stop. Then as she got closer she realized it was not a person pulling a prank and was therefore not stopping for anything. Thinking that no one would take her seriously about a bigfoot when calling 911, she told them she thought she ran over a bear.The witness estimates that she had about 30 strands of hair that she threw away from the license plate bolt. The hair was approx. 3\" long, soft and wiry like dog hair. It was dark brown with a red tinge. The witness said the creature resembled the body of a basketball player about 7 feet tall and slender. There were no ears and when it waved it's arms in the air she noticed how long they went above the head. It's head was round like a human shape. The creature was facing and heading north on the road as she approached in her car.For years, the witness has heard unknown vocalizations from her home in the area, including howls and screams. There are gold mining caves southeast of the incident location and plenty of rugged, forested terrain. The witness can't forget what happen to her on a daily basis. She has driven the same road home for many years and is always looking for this creature and can't believe what happen to her that night.View as witness approached and first saw the creature.View as witness observed creature enter road.Location where creature was first noticed. Current guard rail is recently installed. A concrete barrier was in place at the time of the encounter.View from the creature's perspective of road traveled by witness.",

It was just standing there (it might've been confused, I don't know). My dad thought it was a bear, i think it was too slender to be a bear. My mom (who thinks that the whole concept of cryptids is ridiculious) thought it was a deer, i don't know how because it must've had huge, furry antlers. I think i saw either Skunk Ape or Bigfoot. I've been looking at pictures of them all my life and it's what I saw.",
