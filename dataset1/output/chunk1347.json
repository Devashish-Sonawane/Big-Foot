It was like something was yelling, or trying to yell something. Neighborhood dogs were going crazy. And some dogs ran into the woods and I heard rustling in the woods, and then got on the bus.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness was interviewed in person on 10/17/07. The following account incorporates his reported information, with additional information obtained in the interview.-There were 2 other kids at the bus stop but they were enthralled in their own world of loud iPod music over ear phones. -As he waited, he heard a series of screams and growls over several minutes. He stated that they were very loud and came from a large wooded area at the end of the street about 100 meters away. He stated that the sounds made him very afraid.-He described the vocalizations as very scary, loud screams of about 5 seconds, followed by a 2 to 3 second pause, then a loud growling sound which lasted maybe as long as 10 seconds. This happened about 4-5 times over about 5 minutes.-He described the screams as remaining the same volume, but increasing and decreasing in pitch (my words). -He stated that the combination of screams and growls varied, but that among the screams and growls, \"it sounded like it was trying to scream something... almost like words or something.\" -I had the opportunity to play some of the Bigfoot recordings on BFRO.net for the witness and he identified the screams and howls as like the Snohomish and Ohio sounds. -He listened to the so called \"Samurai Chatter\", and stated that the \"trying to scream something\" sound he heard was similar, though less articulate. I had the opportunity to interview the witness' best friend independently about the account given to him by the witness the day of the incident, and found both accounts to be comparable, with even added information by the friend, saying the witness said some nearby horses were alarmed at the sounds, which the witness later affirmed. Interestingly, last year, being a known BFRO investigator in this rural community, I was contacted personally by an independent witness about similar sounds heard in the same area, which I investigated at that time, though it was not reported on BFRO.net. As I investigated the current report, I was astonished to have been taken to the EXACT same site as last year's report. Additionally, I previously investigated  Report #18427 which took place within several hundred yards of this reported incident, involving a Class A encounter.Based on the testimony of this witness, the corroborating evidence stated by his friend, and in conjunction with the previous investigated BFRO reports in the same area, I acknowledge that this report is likely genuine.",
