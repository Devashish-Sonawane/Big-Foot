            "Follow-Up Report": "During our communication, the witness told me that when he first noticed the tracks, he thought they were very recognizable.  They looked to him as having been made by a giant human being.  He also stated the very idea of it made him extremely nervous... he referred to it as \"primeval fear fell on me.\"  He is fifty-seven years old and this is one of the few times in that span of time that he had a real sensation of fear.  He mentioned that it was the size of the prints and the humanness of them that made him feel that way.  Regarding their size, he stated he couldn't remember exactly how big they were but he remembers that they were twice as long and twice as wide as an ordinary human's.  He stated he took another quick look to verifty that yes, indeed they were what he thought they were, and wasted no time in getting out of there.  He also mentioned some other incidences of tracks in the general area. He has been a sawmiller and a logger for the past thirty years and has spent a significant amount of time in the back country.  This report describes the only time he had ever seen such tracks and since that time he has kept his eyes open looking for such things while in remote areas.  Several other comments he made are below.1) I remember it plain as if it happened last week.2) The weather was warm the day before I saw the prints.3) That allowed the snow to pack and those prints were reallysomething to look at... real real nice prints, as far as detail.Regarding habitat, Don stated that it was very swampy low ground. He also said, \"There were ridges of jack and other pine and cedar with lowland swale holes of black spruce growing really thick which provides real densely forested cover.\"He ended our conversation with the agreement of staying in touch, and getting a hold of a few key people for more details.In another comment, he stated that the widest part of the tracks was at the base where the toes attach.. He declined guessing the length or width of the foot since it happened thirty years ago.",
