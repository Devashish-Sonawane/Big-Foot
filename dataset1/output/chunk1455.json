As we got up the trail by where I saw movement one of my sons noticed some foot prints, that were larger than normal and right next to some deer tracks. Then my other son described exactly what I saw even though I never described what I saw. Earlier in the day we saw a strange \"footprint\" in the mud also.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the father, an elementary school teacher, at the location a day after the sighting.  The family was in a wooded area setting turtle lines out at two nearby lakes. Tropical Storm Beryl had come ashore the night before about 100 miles north. At the time of the sighting, the area was windy and overcast, with rain bands intermittently passing. They were driving down a dirt power line road when the father saw a tall red-colored bipedal figure about  1/4 mile away.  It was standing near the road, and it moved into the woods. The father did not voice what he saw out loud. He stopped the truck when he got to the approximate place he thought he had seen it, and that is when the son asked if he had seen the red-colored bigfoot too. They got out of the truck and found two barefoot looking prints.  The weather was deteriorating, and they went home. Later that afternoon, they returned to take photos and the rain had covered the prints. They checked their turtle lines and had found that three of the lines had been pulled up on land. The next day when I arrived, tropical rains were still intermittently rolling through. While exploring the area, I found three new 11 inch barefoot prints. Photos of two of the 11 inch footprints found:Because it is a remote area, and considering that a tropical storm was impacting the area, it is far-fetched to think someone would have been there walking barefoot and stealing turtles from their lines.  The red or cinnamon coloring of this bigfoot has been seen in this area before, and is common in Florida. (Report #32249)This wooded area is connected to the Lower Wekiva River Preserve and Ocala National Forest which has had many reports. Location: ",
