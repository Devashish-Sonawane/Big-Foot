            "Observed": "In Feb. 1977, a friend, his two older brothers, and his younger cousin and I went backpacking in the Trinity Alps area near Shasta Ca.  I was 17 at the time, and would regularly take time off from high school with my parent\u0092s permission to go on camping trips as long as I kept my grades up.  I do not remember the exact date's as it has been nearly 26 years since the trip.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "On October 29, 2003 I spoke with Pete about his experience in the Trinity Alps of California during he and his friends winter outing of 1977. Today, Pete is a respected peace officer in a very large department and he would like to remain anonymous. We went over his report, but I had to ask him a few specific questions about his encounter. The first question I asked was where this encounter took place. At first Pete couldn\u0092t remember exactly where the encounter took place so we had to go back and refresh his memory. I found the Bigfoot RV park in my wife\u0092s Trailer Life Directory, which turned out to be on Highway 299 about 12 miles west of Weaverville, Ca. Then we had to figure out which road the group took to get into the backcountry with VW buses. I suggested a few road names that were in the area, and Pete remembered the road as the Hobo Gulch Rd. Now for the campground you are on your own. It\u0092s about 12 to 15 miles in, north of Highway 299 and next to the river.Next I asked him why anyone would have stayed a second night after the first encounter, and how long did this encounter last?  Pete said, \u0093We were young and fearless, and were not afraid of too much, plus we thought it might have been a hoax, and perpetrated possibly by the guy that we had met coming in to the campground, or maybe it was the cabin owner. That first encounter lasted about 30 seconds. But, the second time it happened, the hoax, and any human involvement were proved false, because who or whatever did that to us a second time had to be quick, strong and stealthy, and it or whatever it was really wanted us out of there.\u0094 My third question to Pete was if he had ever found any tracks or fresh sign of any kind? Pete said, \u0093The only sign that was observed was the skid marks down a very steep hill, and we could not even try and duplicate them due to our inaccessibility on that hill.\u0094My fourth question was did he hear or smell anything that he could recall now? Pete said, \u0093After the rock hit the VW bus, I heard a loud swishing sound approaching the vehicle. After the second incident, and after we exited the bus, we did smell a musty odor that didn\u0092t linger long.\u0094Pete further stated that his wife made him tell his story \u0093because she thought it was just too good not to have been told. At the time of the incident, we never even thought of, or mentioned that it might have been a bigfoot. I now feel that this creature, unknown, was a little more intelligent than a regular animal, like a bear, because it never hung around, and it never left any marks or tracks around our camp site.\u0094In summary, I believe this to be a classic class \u0093B\u0094 report, and from what occurred, I feel that Pete and his group had an encounter with a sasquatch type creature who was not looking for food, but wanted them to leave the area.Some of my reasons for believing this are:1. The rocking of both VW buses in which the guys thought they were going to be rolled over. No tracks or claw marks were observed in and around the vehicles on the following morning inspections.2. A large granite boulder was thrown or rolled down the hill and ended up under the rear bumper, and behind the rear tire of the VW bus that Pete was sleeping in. He described the impact as, \u0093like a linebacker hitting a quarterback.\u0094 This bolder was 3\u0092 x 3\u0092, and weighed over ninety pounds.  It was not a river rock. Per Pete, \u0093it looked like it was pulled out of a mountain.\u0094 3. The other VW bus was dragged or pulled over 5\u0092 towards the river, and they never smelled a musky odor until they got out of the buses on the second encounter.4. The backpacks and the other camping gear that were left outside on the first night were thrown around.  The packs were opened and their freeze-dried food was scattered around the campsite. There were no teeth marks or claw marks on the backpacks or anything else.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken with the witness who submitted the report and her son many times over the last few years, and have visited the property and surrounding forest where these incidents occurred; just to the east of the White/Habersham County border, in the Sautee-Nacoochee Valley.The witnesses heard characteristic vocalizations, found large man-like tracks in the area, and experienced stalking behavior on several occasions.I find the witnesses to be credible and reliable, and their stories bear a remarkable consistency to other incidents; not just in this particular valley, but in other river valley communities across the continent where these animals occur. The initial on-site investigation was conducted by Georgia-based independent sasquatch researchers Leigh Culver and Wayne Ford.  The Sautee-Nacoochee Valley has produced observation and encounter reports each winter, without exception, for the last several years. I strongly suspect that as wild edibles become scarce during the winter, resident sasquatches will come closer to areas of human habitation and exploit human food resources in addition to their natural diets. Moreover, more deer occur in the Sautee-Nacoochee Valley during winter months than in the surrounding forested mountains. To learn more about the BFRO's research into the connection between deer and sasquatches, read this article.   In the incidents that are reported in North Georgia, the majority of warm-weather reports occur in higher elevations in the mountains along densely vegetated creeks and headwaters; places where wild edibles (like blackberries, persimmons, muscadines, etc.) are abundant seasonally.   Many of these Sautee-Nacoochee Valley winter reports are given to me directly, as I have established a strong network of contacts in White County (having grown up there, and having conducted a great deal of field research there).I would like to encourage more people who are experiencing activity in this particular to report those incidents via our Report Submission Form.
