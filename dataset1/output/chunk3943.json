            "Observed": "While backpacking near the horse trails and access point in the county below Brown County I experienced a confrontation with a bipedal primate. It was early March of 1998 and I was alone. Around seven oclock in the evening after hiking several miles I set up camp in a wooded area about 100 yds. from the horse trail. Darkness was descending quickly so I was in a rush to set up camp and prepare my supper. After gathering firewood and getting my fire started for light and cooking I suddenly began hearing leaves and brush rustling below me and to the east along a ravine that I camped above. At that moment I thought to myself that it was a bit early for mushroom hunters and probably to dark for them to see any. Perhaps its a deer?",
