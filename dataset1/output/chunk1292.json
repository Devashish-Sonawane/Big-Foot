            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness attended the 2008 WV BFRO expedition in April. I found him a convincing, credible witness. He gave details of his sighting directly from memory.  He still displays visible effects from his experience long ago. The recorded sounds used during a call blasting episode gave him a chill. He said they were exactly like those heard in 1985. The strangest part of his story concerns the lighter fluid. No other witness has spoken of such an incident.  This raises additional questions about the animals understanding of the chemical.On the last day of the expedition, a local retiree visited our camp. He was looking for someone to tell his story of bigfoot. He and three other relatives climbed a hill in southeastern Greenbrier County, to experiment with a predator call in 1960. They were approached by a large bipedal animal in the hours after midnight. The creature was so large, it could be heard walking down the hill opposite them, crossing the stream between the hills, and the long approach to their position. He estimated they could hear it for well over a mile in the dry leaves. As the creature neared them, one of their hunting dogs growled. Each of the people were holding the muzzle of a dog, in an effort to keep them quiet. The dogs warning stopped the creature. It came no closer than an estimated 50 yards. The animal walked circles around their hilltop position for over an hour. Eventually the group felt sufficiently intimidated and decided to leave. They departed the hilltop and were escorted out of the woods by this unseen creature. It would walk when they walked, and if a dog barked, it would throw sticks in their direction. He has returned many times in the past 40 years with no further incidents. The events of that night have remained a constant companion to this experienced woodsman. ",
