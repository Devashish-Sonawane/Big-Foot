            "Observed.1  ": "Others in the Cubrent Basin area, two weeks ago, said they heard \"strange\" growling and howling in the area. They said the sounds were like nothing they had heard before and they were frightening. They also heard heavy crashing in the brush and timber at the same time. Mr. Barker also said on a trip back to the basin a week ago, there was a strange smell present troughout the area. Big Foot investigators from all over the nation have been calling Mr. Barker and state wildlife officials to check on the reports and add information. One expert in Colorado said the creature is nocturnal and feeds on both meats and plants. He told Officer Dahlberg the evidence of such a creature he has collected is overwhelming, although he is a disbeliever. Wildlife officers say the initial description of the animal fits that of a grizzly bear. They said, however, it would be \"extremely unusual for a grizzly to be in the area. Two couple said they saw such a creature last June in the Mt. Elizabeth area, about 20 miles from Cuberant Basin. ",

            "Observed.1  ": "The four spread out in the darkness as a cold wind coursed through the leafless trees. Taking a heavy piece of wood, a couple of the men struck hard against a tree. Occasionally, they made a whooping sound. Both actions were a technique of using sound to attract a quarry. And two men from Corrinth, Miss., Jason Mattox and Brian Smith - said they believe the lure worked. At least, something responded in a like manner.  \"We started hearing the wood knocking - bam, bam, bam - and then a whoop. It was deep and it was so clear,\" Smith said. \"It was just around the corner and I was like, 'Oh God.'\" \"Were you giving warnings to each other?\" a voice asked over the radio, refering to a protocol to alert others whenever they would do a wood knock or whoop. \"Yes,\" Mattox replied. \"The way we were stationed, there is no way it could have been Nick (Wamboldt) or Wayne (Ford). We also heard a couple of whoops and maybe a grunt. It was maybe 200 yards up on the ridge above us. No one is up there.\" After the radio conversation, the four gathered at one location to await the other group members. \"It was awesome. It was so distinct,\" Smith said. \"Yeah, my knees started shaking,\" Mattox added. After most of the others had arrived at the remote location, they continued the technique of wood knocking, and again three members of the party said that from their vantage point they heard a wood-knocking response and a long, deep moaning sound. Earlier that same day in a valley shielded by tall mountains the guides found what they described as a pathway, where trees were \"pruned by something very tall\". One part of the expedition party led by Leigh Culver of Atlanta, who is a trained tracker. He found track signs left by something walking on two legs with a long stride. The tracks were not good enough to make castings. This part of Georgia was chosen for the expedition because of a cluster of sighting reports from this area, some of which are shown on the BFRO web site. Eight other expeditions are planned for this year, from sites in Oregon and Ohio to North Carolina. This expedition included people from South Carolina, Alabama, Florida and several from the metro Atlanta area. All of them expressed an eagerness to continue helping the BFRO investigate various sighting areas in Georgia, including this one.",
