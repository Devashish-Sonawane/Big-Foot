            "Observed": "At the time of my sighting I was about 14 years old. My family and I lived ten miles or so from the Oregon Caves. I rode my horses around the area for several years.The night that I seen what ever it was, we had a thunder storm and being the horse freak  I am, I thought that my ponies were going to get hurt.  I had heard a report of a mans Arabians being struck by lightning. So I went out to check on them. I would take a lie detector test to this. On the right hand side of our pasture the river ran along side of it and the hot wire was to the chest of a fifteen hand horse this thing came out of the bottom of the river bed stepped over our hot wire fence and the only way I can describe the walk was like a swinging run because its arms and lags twisted with the run or walk or swing. I cant tell you how tall it was , I got the profile and it was big. very big.! Dark colored. I think it was around late summer or fall. I do have pictures of the house and cabins. The whole incident only took maybe a few seconds. It was fast. I never told any one about it until we had moved.I think we lived there up to 1978 then we moved to Montana ,I told my sister about it then. till this day she is the only one that I have told till now.I know it was Cave Junction , Josephine county, We lived right along side highway 46. The thing stepped over our fences like it was nothing then went across the road and up the embankment on the other side of highway 46.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "There was a dry lightening storm the night of the sighting and the witness went out to check on her horses. The pasture was only about 20-25 yards in front of the cabin and illuminated by large floodlights. The pasture was located between the house and Highway 47. The witness states that she saw a very large upright creature step from the direction of the river and run across the pasture, stepping over the electrical fencing. The animal moved across the pasture and across Hwy 47 up an embankment.  Witness only saw the profile of the animal. She described the animal as \"huge\" and fast. The arms were long and the hands hung slightly below the bent knees of animal. The legs were very thick and slightly bent as it ran. The head was bent down as if animal was looking at its feet as it ran. She saw an all over dark color, though not as dark as a black bear. ",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Additional information surfaced during our phone conversations.  Bob is a guide in the area where his sighting occurred and has been backpacking the area annually for about 20 years.  During this time he has seen much wildlife though nothing like what he saw on this day.  Never has he seen another person on the bench.Outdoor Magazine has called this area the most wild place in the contiguous U.S.  It is located between Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, and Canyonlands National Parks and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.  It is a desert of white hardrock, rolling hills, and gullies with pinyon pine, sage, brush, beaver, lots of fish, mountain lion, and deer.  There are many canyons and cliff dwellings in the area.  The witness confirms that water is a major limiting factor here, requiring wildlife as well as humans to stay in proximity to it or to plan movements accordingly.  Incidentally, it is approximately 1 \u00bd miles from Deer Creek to the ridge where the white animal was seen.The animal was first observed while Bob and his friend were coming up out of the gully up onto the bench.  It had one arm raised shading its eyes and was pacing back and forth as if looking for something.  It was so intent on looking out toward the horizon that it didn't look down to see the two hikers for about 10-15 minutes.  It was between 7 and 9 feet tall and pure white.  It would've been camouflaged against the white rock if viewed from above but from below it was visible against the blue sky.  They weren't afraid but knew better than to approach it like you wouldn't approach a bear.The witness was reluctant to classify the animal as a sasquatch.  He had \"never thought of it as that type of sighting\" but concedes,\"it was some sort of humanoid, too big and too agile to be human.  I guess I could accept sasquatch; it walked on two legs\". He never considered this a story he would ever repeat except around a campfire...until a camping / hunting friend of his (who records sounds of the wild including some he cannot identify, and whose sincerity he is convinced of) told Bob of a white sasquatch he'd heard about.  He thought maybe what he saw was one of those.Bob's original estimate of 1996 for the year of the sighting was in error.  After examining his journal, it was determined that his sighting took place in 1994.",
