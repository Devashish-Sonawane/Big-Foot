The witness estimated they originated from a mile to two miles away.  The distant scream was what first got the witness' attention.  After that, the witness noted the onset of extreme quietness followed by what the witness described as a combination of a shout and a roar.  \"It wasn't like any animal sound I had ever heard before\" commented the witness.  The witness said \"the sound made me want to go in the house\". The Columbiana recording he is referring to is the \"1994 Ohio - Moaning Howl\" located on this site.No other sounds or activity was observed by the witness.   The witness' location is in the vicinity of a nature reserve and the Cuyhaoga Valley National Park. We have received several reports from Summit County and in and around this national park.  ",

This location is the old entry point to Hollywood Gorge (In the 1930 a movie called God's Country and the Woman was filmed at this spot) Go on up the Tower road and the next road intersecting from the left is Rock Creek Road. The land now belonges to the Weyerhaeuser Company is is most likely gated, although during hunting season it is unlocked. Proceed about 2 miles. In 1970 the roaded dead-ended at this landing. It may have all changed since then, although I don't think the trees growing at this site in 1970 have been harvested yet, but trees 100 yards or so farther east would most likely would have been by now.",

            "Observed": "The year was 1970 and my friend John and I rode my Honda 90 along logging roads to a secluded area which was about 7 miles from my family's cabin on the Toutle River. The USGS map of about 1952 labeled the road as Rock Creek Road and it intersected the Tower Road just about 150 yards NE of Hollywood Gorge. I remember the year because John had been graduated from high school and was working at Longview Logging and Mill Supply and I was about to enter my junior year of high school. Anyway, it was summer and we were camping in my father's old army pup tent when we heard what sounded like several apes screaming. We both agreed that was the best description of the sound. It was fairly dark and we looked out of the tent and saw a large dark silhouette about 150 feet from the front of the tent. John had a JC Higgins single shot 22 rifle and I had a Winchester gallery gun also in 22 cal. What we saw we thought was a big foot and we shouted out several warnings to whoever or whatever was there that we were going to begin shooting. After getting no response, we pumped several rounds into it and it did not move. We finally got brave enough to go out and investigate only to learn it was an old tree stump from when the area was logged by McCormick Brothers in the late 1800s or early 1900s.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on the phone for approximately 15 minutes. The witness was able to recall fine details of the evening without hesitation and was very open and forthright with his statements about his experience.He stated that he and his friend heard several primate sounding vocalizations that night for 15-20 seconds each and further specified the estimated range at approximately 100 yards. He noted that the sounds were unusual enough to disturb himself and his friend. He stated that he had never heard a sound like it and has not again since 1970. His description of the sounds heard were compared to monkeys at the zoo when they are excited or agitated. The witness did not hear any other sounds or see anything else unusual that night or since.The witness was also willing to give GPS coordinates of the location where the vocalizations were heard.To rule out the Barred Owl from the possible animals he may have heard, I sent him a recording of Barred Owl sounds. The witness commented that what I sent him was lower pitched and reiterated that the sounds they heard were higher pitched and sounded as if you were at the zoo and  \"the monkeys got all worked up and started screaming\".After speaking with the witness, it is my opinion that his report was geniune and he is familiar with the local wildlife and was convinced that what he and his friend heard that evening was not a human or known animal. Although no recordings were obtained and the experience is not conclusive, I believe that what the witness and his friend heard that night MAY have been an unverified animal or animals commonly known as the sasquatch.",
