I remember because we had to turn around, go back up around Tahoe, and take Highway 80 back to the Bay Area. We were among the first to the slide area, and got out of our truck to look. It was early evening, and  I saw a huge, bi-pedal creature on the slide side of the river. It was on the Tahoe (east) side of the slide, as were we.  It was high on the hill, and appeared to also be regarding the slide. I saw it for about 15 seconds, when it ambled up the hill and out of sight.",
