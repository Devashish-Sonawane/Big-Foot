The arm was so hairy as to be \"furry\". The hair stopped at the wrist and the back of the hand was not hairy, with the skin colored black on both sides of the hand. The nails were extraordinarily long and projected beyond the fingertips for a total length of about 4\". Their color was described as off-white, like candle wax. All fingers including the thumb were long in relation to the hand as a whole. The width of the palm was conservatively estimated at 9\" and the length of the hand at 14\" from wrist to fingertips.The vocalizations outside his tent heard after the hand sighting consisted of animalistic grunts, groans, gurgling sounds and subdued screams, nothing remotely like words, higher pitched than the sounds made by an excited gorilla. They were the sounds of a male and female, as judged by their relative pitch. They both ran away from the campground, making hooting sounds akin to those of Indian warriors.",
