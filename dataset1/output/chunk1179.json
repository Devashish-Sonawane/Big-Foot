            "Follow-Up Report": "I have spoken with the actual witnesses on multiple occasions and am convinced that they had bigfoot activity on their property. While back in the woods behind their home, the mother noticed the trees stripped of the leaves and a strange smell in the air. Her son noticed the smell and told his Mom that something didn't feel right about the area. They both felt like they were being watched by something but never saw anything. Then, the sound of wood striking wood began around them, which scared them very much and caused them to flee the area. On another occasion a few years ago, large barefoot tracks were found in the field by their house. At the time they didn't think much of them.In spring of 2003, her son was the first one to find footprints across the street from their house. He came home to let her know what he had found. The mother and grandmother went with him to the location and witnessed a series of eight to ten tracks with very long strides. They were going through some mud into a grass field that headed toward another wood line. The tracks were \"huge\" according to the mother. She estimated over 17 inches long and 8 inches wide at the toes. I asked her how many toes or claws? She responded they were more human-like with five toes, and no claw marks evident. She was very impressed with the width of the tracks and how long the strides were.  Not too long after that, her son and nephew were playing behind the lot across the street heading toward a creek in the valley below. As they came upon the creek, they heard something big moving through the brush. At first, they thought it was a deer. They came to the deepest part of the creek where the water pools and took their shoes off to wade in the water. The nephew happened to look at the other side of the creek and saw a large creature standing there staring at the two of them. He froze and pointed at the creature on the other side of creek. Her son looked up and could see this thing watching the two of them. It was very dark brown in color and looked to be standing there behind some bushes. The boys stood there for what seemed a minute staring at the creature. Then, the nephew took off without warning while her son went to grab his shoes. The son claimed he could hear it moving again which freaked him out. He ran as fast as he could up to the top of the hill where his cousin was waiting. When he got up to the top of the hill, they both looked down and could see the creature moving through the brush. It was walking in an upright position the whole time they viewed it. The two boys described it as a large monkey or gorilla. The mother noted that it seems the majority of all incidents have happened after it rains. They've been hearing strange sounds for over three years on the backside of their property. They could never figure out what it was until the son found the tracks across the street, and the two boys had the sighting. She feels the nasty smell and strange wood-knocking sounds they encountered is definitely related to what the boys saw.  ",

I came to a little creek crossing and small ravine about 200 yds behind the local store and found myself gazing at what appeared to be a fallen tree with a broken stump about 6ft up and some odd features in it.  Ex: Dark features that kind resembled eyes and arms coming across a leg.  Like if you were to sit over your feet in a crouched position.  It was about 3pm so the effects could have been from lighting and the trees.  Either way I thought it looked cool and wanted to go get my camera.  I placed a pile of rocks directly across from it and ran literaly and got my camera.  Upon arriving back at the location, about 15 min later, I noticed my pyramid of rocks was knocked over and when I looked across the way there was nothing.  No fallen tree, no branches and nothing worth taking a picture of.  I searched around the area thinking I was looking from the wrong angle but the only thing right across the way could have in no way been what I was looking at.  A few days later back in Portland, OR the news said that there had been a report of a Bigfoot in that area.  I have never gone camping there again!",
