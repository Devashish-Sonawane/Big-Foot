            "Follow-Up Report": "A fifty minute phone interview was conducted with the witness during and the following additional information was obtained:The witness is a business owner and an avid hunter who also provides firearm training and certification in conjunction with local police. He purchased the property several years ago and built a deer stand from which he would periodically hunt. In 2009 he built a house into the hillside of the property and has been living there since. The deer stand on his property sits approximately 100 yard into the woods from his house.In late July/early August 2011, over the course of several days, the witness awoke in the early morning on two different occasions by a very loud single vocalization that he described as a \"guttural, wolf-like howl\".  Being an avid outdoorsman and familiar with several local animal sounds, he was adamant that the sound he heard was not from a coyote or other animal familiar to him.Approximately one month later in late August 2011, at approximately 9pm in the evening, the witness was on his back porch and heard thee distinct, loud \"wood on wood\" knocks which were subsequently repeated approximately 10 minutes later.  About 15 minutes later the witness returned two knocks using a piece of 8 x 8 board that he hit against his back porch. He immediately heard two return wood knocks and then he returned two knocks.  A short time later, he heard two more return knocks.  The witness reported that the repetitive two wood knock exchanges lasted for approximately 15 minutes. He stated that the wood knocks came from a single location that he estimated to be about 75-100 yards away and in the general vicinity of his deer stand.In October 2011, at approximately 10-11am, the witness was on his back porch and heard a very loud branch break coming from the direction of his deer stand.   He noted that it was a very clear, windless night. Two days later, the witness walked to his tree stand and found a 3-4\" diameter freshly broken tree branch lying about 20 feet from a tree that he believed the branch was broken from. He estimated the height of the broken tree branch at approximately 5 to 6 feet off the ground.In early January 2012, at approximately 8pm in the evening, the witness was on his back porch and heard a noise moving down the wooded hillside slope toward his house. Upon shining his flashlight into the woods, he saw a \"pair of reddish eyes\" staring at him.  He stared at the animal for approximately 20 seconds during which he observed the animal \"blink\" a couple of times. Then he heard the animal turn and walk slowly away back up the hillside deeper into the woods.  The next day, the witness identified a reference tree immediately adjacent to where he recalled the animal to be standing. He measured the height from the ground to the point on a branch of the reference tree and determined it to be approximately 7 feet.Upon further questioning, the witness reported that he sometimes leaves food scraps and fruit in the backyard during the warmer months. In addition, the witness mentioned that there are numerous old logging trails running through the mountain behind his property, along with several caves and numerous wild blueberry bushes. The witness also reported seeing coyotes, bear, and a mountain lion in the general area around Becket.  The area around Becket is sparsely populated and is characterized with interior hills bordered on the east side by Mount Gobble and on the west side by Becket Mountain and Walking Mountain. There are numerous marshy brooks and ponds throughout the region. The Appalachian Trail passes through the western part of the town and the area is adjacent to the southeastern corner of October Mountain State Forest and Class A report 1199.",

            "Observed": "Last night my friend, his girlfriend, and I went kayaking around Keystone Lake, in Oklahoma. The lake levels have been about 15 ft above normal, and we decided to go kayaking and camping. There is a penninsula that is open during the day to people to use four wheelers and dirt bikes on, but since the water has been so high for about a month it has been inaccessable to them due to the path going out there, is under water. We got out there about 8:00 p.m. and kayaked the mile or so to a nice sandy beach, and set up the tent and started a fire. We cooked hot dogs and fished a bit but caught nothing. Midnight rolled around and my friends girlfriend had to be at work early the next morning so he was going to escort her back to her car. Just as they were getting their gear together, we heard some grunting and repeating howling noise with the same tone pattern about five times. I am an Eagle Scout and a seasoned camper in these parts, so hearing this noise frightened me a bit and made me not want to tend the fire alone on the island. I then kayaked with the two of them back to the cars. My friend and I returned to the camp site about 1:30 or so, we got the fire started again and decided to fish a small wooded area that was under water 50 or so feet from our beach. We did that with no success for 30 minutes or so, and headed back to the beach. My friend was about 20 feet the shore and I was about 30 feet and we passed a lower area with willow trees on our way back to our camp and a very large rock, much too large for a human to pick up and throw landed within feet of his kayak. We stopped and shined our flash lights at the shore to see what threw that at us. We could only see just beyond the trees due to the low hanging willow trees. We sat and talked a minute about what just happend and another slightly larger rock landed in the same area making a huge splash. We both got really scared and back paddled a good distance from the shore. I told him what I thought had just happend and watching a show on Bigfoot one time, I remembered that they throw rocks and make similar noises to the ones we had heard earlier. We made the decision to pack up and head out. We heard or saw nothing else while packing up the tent and gear. We took turns shining a light in the forest while the other packed his gear, because we were both pretty scared. I have camped hundreds of nights and have never left in the night, like we did last night. We kayaked around the island before we left to see if any boats were anchored, but we were definitly the only humans on the island.",
