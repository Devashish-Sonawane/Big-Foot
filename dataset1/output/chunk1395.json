We have three pit bull dogs and they are very agressive when they hear unusual noises but they were terrified by something outside. My son **** went out to see what the noise was and I followed him.  I noticed an awful smell, like something dead or nasty garbage. Then this huge man-like creature ran right in front of us and headed to the woods. I was scared and so was ****. We were both frightened. We just stood there frozen. We have alot of trees on our property and this thing was as tall as our orange tree (about 8 feet). We woke everyone up in the else and kept watching to see it was coming back.  We live on 3.6 acres of heavy wooded property on the edge of the Ocala National Forest. I have never seen anything so scary in my life. This creature was dark and hairy and was walking on two feet.",

The second smaller one was approximated at 6-7 feet in height with no guess on the weight given.The first animal was seen at a distance of 40 yards and the second's estimated distance was 60 yards. Both were brownish in color, and the duration of the sighting was about 10-15 seconds.Both animals then ran into the wooded area at what was described as a loping gait.After they had gone, one of the witnesses attempted to look for tracks but could find none.The winesses dog would not approach during the duration of the sighting.I found the witnesses to be credible in the retelling of their encounter.",

            "Observed": "So after a night of hanging out in Lake Stevens couple friends and my older brother and I decided to go out driving on the Mountain Loop Highway. We had been doing this for about a week. The first time was Friday 17th I had heard some Whoops. Then tonight, Thursday 23 on the same road, National Service Road (edited) I had brought 3 guys and my older brother to the same exact place and we decided to stop a bit and look around, not getting out of the car. I had heard a little bit of Howls and a whoop. At around 10:45 pm I started talking about my first time out there mentioning Eye Shine, then my brother said \"Like those ones over there?\" WE all look out the window there had to have been at least 8 pairs staring back at us. The driver had mentioned how he had been seeing eye shines for a while by then. One of our passengers was extremely scared which then the driver decided it was better to clear out of there and rethink it. WE are planning on returning on Saturday the 25th night time around 10 pm with video cameras, possibly some night vision equipment, and audio files.",
