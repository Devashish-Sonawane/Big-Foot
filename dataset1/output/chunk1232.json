            "Follow-Up Report": "The witnesses are not from this area and were visiting family. The figure was seen for just a few seconds. The witnesses were moving at 70 mph. They could not provide much detail as to the features, etc.  Their impression was that it was tall, uniformly brownish in color, and the brush/palmettos came up to its thighs. In the area it was briefly observed, the only possible witnesses would be passing motorists. I drove to the location, not able to identify the exact billboard but able to observe the general area. The Manatee River and several creeks are close by.  Several parks are nearby including Myakka River, Manatee Lake and Duett.  Farms and ranches are abundant, along with a lot of road construction and new housing developments.   The original submission to the BFRO showed awareness of the \"Myakka Skunk-Ape\" photos.  The BFRO is certain that the \"Myakka Skunk-Ape\" photos are fake, due to prior contact with the person who came up with the photos. One year prior to him trying to hype and markets the photos (and its accompanying, \"anonymous\" letter), the man, named David Barkasay, contacted the BFRO asking how much photos like these would be worth. It was clear at that time that he had something up his sleeve, so when he came back to the BFRO year later saying his friend recently received some photos from an \"anonymous\" source, it was obvious what was going on.  Also, the original Myakka Skunk-Ape photos included randomly placed stars in the night sky in the background.  When this issue pointed out to him, Barkasay came back with a new set of photos, without the fake stars in the background. He claimed the fake stars were caused by dust on the glass of the copy machine.  It was obvious that the fake stars were intended to be stars.Also, the wife of the friend who supposedly received the fake photos through his work place at an animal control office near Myakka, admitted over the phone that the photos were fake and created by Barkasay.
