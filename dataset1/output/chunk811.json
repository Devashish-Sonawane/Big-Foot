            "Follow-Up Report": "The family has a summer cabin on the Clark Fork River.  They have 30 acres, some of which they grow alfalfa on in the summer. Around July 21, 2008 around 3 AM, the couple where woken by several loud screams. They had never heard such a loud animal noise before. They knew it was not a coyote. The sound began near the river and traveled toward the house, past the window and toward the mountains.  By the second scream the husband, a former police officer, had his gun drawn.  The screams continued away from the house; when they looked out the window, they saw nothing. They have never heard a sound like it before or since.Earlier that day their septic tank had overflowed in the yard next to the house. All day, they could not use their bathroom, and used the outdoors instead. The smell of the overflow was very strong all night, and the wind carried the smell down the river. It could have attracted many things.The following summer, the witness\u0092 mother claimed to have seen a huge \u0093hairy man\u0094 one night outside. It was standing near a 6 ft tall totem pole they have in the yard; it was much larger and broader in the shoulders.  It was holding its arm above its head and waving an object it had in its hand.  She woke up her husband, but it was no longer there when they returned to the window. The following morning, a baby rabbit that had been pulled apart was left in the place it seemed to have been standing. Unfortunately the mother did not want to discuss her sighting with me.After the mother had her sighting, the witness researched the area to see if any other bigfoot reports were nearby. She discovered that a week after they heard the screaming, a bigfoot had been reportedly seen east of town, crossing Hwy 90. Outdoor Life articleAlso see BFRO media article #563 The witness then looked into the sounds bigfoot make. She found one that sounded very much like what she had heard and played it for him without telling him what it was. When he heard it, he agreed that it was almost exact. She then told him it was thought to be a sasquatch, known as the Snohomish HowlsDuring the summer alfalfa is grown around the property. Elk come down and give birth in the fields. The mother elk cross the river, and many times the babies are too frightened to follow. They hear the mothers calling across the river for the babies and many times hear predators attacking the babies. They do not know what kills them. ",
