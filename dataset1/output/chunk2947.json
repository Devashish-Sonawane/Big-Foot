            "Follow-Up Report": "I performed a site visit on January 5th 2013 with two of the witnesses.  The following can be added to the report. The road that the prints were on had been plowed and they were no longer visible.  The prints were found coming out of the woods and heading south on a road.  The estimated size of the tracks were approximately 12.5 inches long and 6 inches wide.  Photos they took of the prints:The area has farms located near the tracks where there is livestock and fields.  During the site visit, deer were noted browsing in the fields. Also, with snow melt the area was very icy and travel on this road is not prevalent.  The tracks entered the road from an area that is a flood plain where a creek runs though. The creek empties into the Huron River which is about two miles away.  This area, is where some of the waterways flow north to Lake Erie, and south to the Ohio River.  The area also has a power line right-of-way going through it.  It was the power line right- of-way that the crew was trimming when they came upon the prints.  Interviewing the witnesses, they spoke about the trackway and the following details can be added.  The tracks did not seem to show signs of a person running as there wasn't any sliding motion to them. Approximately 20 prints were observed in an area, some of them in better condition than others.  The trackway covered a distance of about 160 feet along the road. The prints seemed to be flat footed and even in stride, even though the area where they were found was on a hill.  During the site visit the area is posted as private property which limited the investigation and the search for other foot prints.  I found the witnesses to be credible and experienced outdoorsmen. They have spent many hours hunting throughout the state and spoke in depth on the trackway.  ",

            "Observed": "In mid july 2004 I was on my back porch it faces east and it faces a mountain I live in the woods on the side of my house where the creature was the house is scarecly wooded and the land is flat.  The sun was shining. The reason I went out side is this, my dogs started to bark and run through the house they got half way through the dog door stopped an whined. I thought that was odd so I went and sat on the back porch. Then I saw the tree to my left move and the tree was about 300 yards away from me or less I am bad with measurements.  So I watched the tree to see what caught my eye and then I saw the creature.  It was behind the tree looking out from behind it.  It's head was in the banches and it was hunching.   Is's head was large and it had a definate brow I thought I was seeing an oranatang.  Except it was about 6 and ahalf feet tall.  It was moving it's head aroud the tree to watch me as I stood up to get a better look. It's hair was a rust color like to color of dead pine needles, It's eyes were haunting. And it was completely silent.  It was watching me while I was watching it.  I sat back down.  I watched outside for about 6 minutes and didn't tell the person on the phone.",
