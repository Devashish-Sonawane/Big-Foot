            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness in a telephone interview and can add the following information.  When the witness heard the two howls he thought it was some kind of call and response but did not recognize it as any animal he was familiar with.  The calls occurred while it was still dark, and as he still had some time before it would be light enough to hunt, he decided to get his binoculars.  As he started to leave the truck was when he heard the \"Hey You!\" He stated that it wasn't like a person would speak as though they were walking up on you or calling out to someone.  It was in a low tone and very gruff.  He also stated that it was a little creepy as he felt it was close by at no more than a distance of 20 to 30 yards.  The witness had not seen any indication that anyone else was in the area.  During our conversation, the witness commented that he watched an episode of Finding Bigfoot and learned that a Sasquatch will mimic other animals and initially thought that the howls he heard could be a Sasquatch but dismissed the thought.  After the \"hey you\", he reconsidered his thought.  I explained to the witness that his experience is not unheard of and has even occurred on BFRO expeditions.  The area of the witness' experience has a history of sightings and is not very far from where the BFRO held the Texas 2012 expedition.  The witness is a military veteran and an avid outdoorsman. I found him to be very credible and his account consistent with other reports and my own experience.",

They were all snapped in half about 6-8 feet up. The trees were alive and still had foliage. They were all pointing directly at a 90 degree angle to the road. The trees were about 3 inches in diameter. 50 feet down the road I photographed another tree in the same configuration, snapped 6-8 feet up and 90 degrees to the road. It was at the bend in the road. This was at the steepest and roughest terrain of the road.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I found the witness to be credible and factual in his description of the events.  It is highly possible that he was being watched by a sasquatch during his target shooting session and afterwards.  An interesting observation is that the sounds started after the witness was done shooting and possibly perceived as no longer a threat. Here is the video that contains the cracking sound:The witness also provided pictures from a dirt-bike ride in the same area a few days later.  The pictures provided could indicate sasquatch activity in the area.The witness will continue to visit the area to try and find additional indications of sasquatch activity.The Mountain Loop Highway has a long history of Bigfoot activity, including the following reports:Report # 44368.Report # 43911.Report # 43757.Report # 44368.Report # 41602.Report # 39858.Report # 37307.Report # 37101.Report # 26353.Report # 25882.Report # 23170.Report # 23017.Report # 16276.Report # 1880.Report # 1722.Report # 1672.The Mountain Loop Highway is a highway in the U.S. state of Washington. It traverses the western section of the Cascade Range within Snohomish County. The name suggests it forms a full loop, but it only is a small portion of a loop, which is completed using State Routes 92, 9, and 530. Part of the highway is also a designated and signed Forest Highway, and is known as Forest Route 20.The highway connects the towns of Granite Falls and Darrington. It is paved for 34 miles (55 km) from Granite Falls to Barlow Pass (2349') where the highway becomes unpaved for 13 miles (21 km), and then paved again for the remaining 9 miles (14 km) to Darrington. The unpaved section is U.S. Forest Service Road #20 and passes several USFS campgrounds. Portions of the unpaved section are often closed for periods of several years due to flood damage.",
