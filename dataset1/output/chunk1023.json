            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness told me of this incident in detail and he also told me of the two other incidents that I would classify as Class B. He wasn't exactly sure of the years until we talked at length about the incidents and he began to recall the approximate timeframes for the encounters; 1978 - 1979. The witness described the animal that he encountered in 1978 as having \"black, weathered skin.\" From what he could see, the face and head appeared to him to be very similar to a gorilla. In fact, during the encounter, for much of the time, he actually thought he was watching a gorilla that had been let loose or escaped into the East Texas woods. He said the prospect of encountering a gorilla in the wild actually frightened him quite a bit. It wasn't until several minutes of somewhat distant observation (perhaps fifty yards) had occurred did it occur to him that it wasn't a gorilla.The witness said the animal was lying under the tree and propping itself up on its arm. It was moving its head around a little and appeared to be looking around at its surroundings. He could not see the eyes or mouth or nose, but he did say that from what he could tell, its face appeared to be similar to a gorilla. The animal's color was gray or charcoal, but the skin was decidedly black. The witness told me of another possible visual that he had in 1979. Again while squirrel hunting, the witness saw what at first appeared to be spanish moss blowing in the breeze at about eight or nine feet up a tree trunk. He saw the movement peripherally, before turning to look directly. At that time, the witness believed that he was looking at a head peering from around the tree at a distance of perhaps fifty to sixty yards. The witness thought that \"spanish moss\" was hair. After a few seconds, the head and the hair or \"spanish moss\" was gone. Liberty County is adjacent to Montgomery County, San Jacinto County and the Sam Houston National Forest, an area of study for the BFRO and TBRC.",
