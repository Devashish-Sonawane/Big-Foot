            "Observed.1  ": "In the 1960s, some strange footprints were found in a Chilton County peach grove. Now the original investigator reminisces about the time he spent tracking Bigfoot. \u0094In our opinion it was definitely not a fake. It was a real track,\u0094 said James Earl Johnson, the former Chilton County investigator, whose case sparked a legend back in the 1960s. \u0093We checked the peach orchard, and there was a trail leading out of the peach orchard, and it was tracks -- strange looking tracks, similar to a human but bigger and wider,\u0094 said Johnson. With nothing but a print to go on, picking a name for the elusive creature wasn't very hard. Since then, Bigfoot sightings have been reported across the country, and sketches of the creature vary depending on where the sighting occurred. The name varies as well. In Alabama, the creature is known as Bigfoot, while in northern areas, it's known as a Sasquatch. \u0093Supposedly, the legend is that a hairy man-like creature that walks on two legs at some point inhabited the bottomland swamp regions in Chilton County in Clanton, Ala.,\u0094 said Bryan Wyatt, a Bigfoot researcher. \u0093I know one thing: (Bigfoot) likes Chilton County peaches,\u0094 said Johnson.",
