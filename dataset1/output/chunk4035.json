            "Observed.1  ": "\u0093As we approached Sepulga River, we saw a moving figure run straight across the bridge in front of us,\u0094 the witness said. \u0093For a split second, I thought it was a person, running across the bridge.\u0094 The witness said he quickly changed his mind when he was that the creature was \u0093solid black.\u0094 \u0093It ran very quickly with its knees appearing to be bent while it kept its head and upper body very erect,\u0094 the witness said. \u0093It jumped over the railing. It raised its arms to the sides as it jumped, and they seemed to be very shaggy.\u0094 The witnesses lost sight of the creature after that, but others many have seen the strange animal around this same time. \u0093There were cars behind us on the road,\u0094 the witness said. \u0093We also saw parked vehicles near the water. Possibly those people saw it too, though I couldn\u0092t say for sure if they did.\u0094 While this story may sound farfetched to some readers, it\u0092s not the first time that a strange creature has been reportedly seen in that same part of eastern Conecuh County. According to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, a similar creature was reported near the intersection of U.S. Highway 84 and the Sepulga River on Aug. 10, 2004. The witness in that case reported seeing a six to seven-foot-tall \u0093black, hairy man-like creature\u0094 cross the road less than 20 feet in front of his truck. \u0093It looked very human but had hair hanging down to its hands,\u0094 the witness said. \u0093It looked right at me and kept eye contact but just kept running. I heard it crashing through the trees after it ran by. Before that, I had found large footprints near the river and didn't think much of it. Once I saw the creature, I knew it had made the prints I saw a few months earlier.\u0094 The witness said the creature had a \u0093manlike face\u0094 and \u0093very long arms.\u0094 The witness also said that the creature wasn\u0092t thin, but muscular, and had a wide nose and a conical-shaped head. When it ran, it also pumped its arms, the witness said, also noting that the creature came from the direction of the river and appeared to be wet. The latest report of a sighting of a strange creature near the Sepulga River comes on the heels of reports in May of Bigfoot sightings in the Clarke County community of Gainestown, which is about 46 miles from downtown Evergreen. Those reports led The Clarke County Democrat newspaper in Grove Hill to request that anyone who had seen a Bigfoot in Clarke County to call or e-mail their office. They also sought any photos that might be out there of a Bigfoot creature in Clarke County. Here, at The Courant, we are issuing a similar call to anyone who has witnessed a Bigfoot or other strange animal in Conecuh County. Witnesses are invited to contact The Courant by e-mail at courantsports@earthlink.net or by phone at 578-1492 or by writing The Evergreen Courant, ATTN: Lee Peacock, P.O. Box 440, Evergreen, AL 36401.",

The national Bigfoot Field Research Organization investigated the report, interviewed the witnesses and deemed them credible.  Most wildlife professionals do not believe Bigfoot exists - they say what is being sighted around the country are bears and other large animals.  The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency takes that position, stating that if such a species existed the remains of one would have been discovered before now, or would would have been detected on a trail camera used by hunters to photograph wildlife.",

            "Observed.1  ": "However, if there should be such a creature in the wild, it is protected by law. Although there is no concrete evidence to prove the existence of Bigfoot (such as a body or an indisputable photograph) there have been numerous reported sightings by credible witnesses, such as the one last year in Wilson County. According to the BFRO report, the two youngsters went for a walk on a logging road while the father of one was bush-hogging a nearby field.   The girl was walking ahead of the boy and as she came around a turn in the road she saw a creature approximately eight feet tall, standing erect on two legs, with an arm around a tree. The animal was leaning out and away from the tree as though to look at her. It was approximately 20 yards away, close enough for he girl to give this detailed description:   It was covered in hair (not fur) that was black and glossy with hints of dark brown.  It was completely covered in hair except for portions of its face.  The skin of the face was lighter in color than the hair.   The eyes were very large, dark, and wide-set.   The nose was \"normal size\" for the face.   The arms were muscular, as were the shoulders, so much so that it appeared that the creature was shrugging its shoulders.   The chest was flat and muscular. There was an oddity about the lower jaw on the right side of the face; the jaw appeared to be \"dropped\" on that side, as in an expression of surprise or perhaps in the act of chewing. The teeth were visible on that side of the face. The encounter lasted approximately 20 seconds before the girl turned and quickly walked back to her friend.  She told him what she had seen and they started to return to the field where the boy's father was working.  They glanced back, and the creature had followed the girl and was standing in the road 10 yards away, next to a cedar tree.  The boy described the creature exactly as the girl did. They quickly hurried away, told the boy's father what they had seen, and he returned with them back to the spot.  The creature was not seen again. According to the BFRO the description of the animal fit that of other sightings around the country over the years. Wildlife biologists insist such a large creature could not elude hunters and photographers in today's increasingly shrinking wild habitat. But they cannot explain why large numbers of credible witnesses continue to report seeing a creature that doesn't exist.",
