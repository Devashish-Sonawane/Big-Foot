            "Follow-Up Report": "Principal Investigator: Jim Henick Large, barefoot, bipedal tracks were reported to BFRO by experienced trapper Bear Maley. They were found on 1/17/00. Mr. Maley has been trapping in the area for many years. He has seen similar tracks before in his extensive trapping work. These were the clearest and freshest he has yet seen in this densely forested area. There was a line of atleast twenty tracks that crossed the road and descended a slope, then across creek. They indicated an amimal with a very long stride. They were not accurately measured or photographed. Bear followed them for a short stretch before snow and blowdown timber made it too difficult to continue. A strong windstorm was approaching so he had to vacate the area quickly. Experienced outdoorsman and expert Jim Henick met up with Mr. Maley on Saturday, February 22, 2000. Jim and Bear toured the area where the prints were found as Bear checked his trap line. The snow had melted from the area where the tracks had been found. After parting company with Bear, Jim continued to explore adjacent remote areas north of the peak and found two more discernible tracks in the soil/duff. The heel portion of the best track had been partially eroded by rainfall runoff but the forefoot and all five toe impressions were clearly visible. No claw marks. Jim estimated track length at 16\".
