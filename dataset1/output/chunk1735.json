We were about 20 yards apart and we were both looking SE. I turned slowly and didn't see anything, but then did see movement in front of me. I pulled up my gun, ready for a turkey. It was about 20 yards away and I didn't shoot. I didn't know what it was. It was on two legs, all brown-red hair all over it and at least six feet tall. It took off running like a big guy, but swift. It ran down hill away from me and was out of sight. My dad was still looking the other way. I wish he saw it to, but he didn't.",

As the witness spotted it, it turned and quickly ran away.  He described its body as stocky.  No clear facial features were observed, but he could discern that it did not have a protruding muzzle like a bear.  The area is very hilly, primarily deciduous forest, but does include some farm land.",
