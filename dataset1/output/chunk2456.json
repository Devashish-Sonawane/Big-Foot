            "Observed": "My wife and I took a drive to Skaguay reservoir near Victor Colorado. Nice day and there were people fishing along the lake. Crazy thing is it was 11am and this thing walked across a valley in full sight of lots of people. It was across the lake maybe half a mile, walking slow but was moving at a fast pace, its arm movements and stride looked normal to be going that fast. I asked my wife her thought and she said it looked big and moved real differently. There were people on the lake and on the far bank half way to the animal fishing, it appeared larger at a greater distance. When it left the valley it left a way or on a trail that no one would choose. Before it left sight it stop behind a tree watched for a minute and walked away.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with the witness via telephone call about his sighting.  Witness is a retired construction company owner.  He was very well-spoken, and was able to provide verbal details about the sighting, as well as collaborate with me via Google Maps to point out the exact location of both he and his wife, as well as the location of the figure he observed.Witness related that he was in a position to view the subject as it was observing people fishing from the banks of the reservoir.  The subject seemed to be strategically placed so that the people on the banks would not look up and see it.  The subject at a certain point realized that the witness was watching, at which point it left its position, and walked with long strides to a wooded area.  The subject was observed at the other side of the wooded area at the edge of a clearing, at which point it tried to hide behind a pine tree.  It then played \"peek a boo\" with the witness for a minute, then strode across the clearing and disappeared into the timber to the east of the reservoir.  The witness stated that the figure was unusually large and was uniformly dark in color.  It did not appear to be wearing clothing.  An estimate of 8 feet in height was made based on comparison to the tree that it was hiding behind prior to its departure. They were approximately .25 miles from the subject at the closest.The terrain in this area is very steep, with the \"banks\" of the reservoir at an almost cliff-like angle in many places.  The area is remote, with limited access by county road.  The area that the subject was observed in was on the southeast end of the reservoir near the dam, to which there is no immediate road access.  The subject departed the area into a heavily wooded national forest area called Douglas Gulch, with no development or highway for several miles in that direction.Subject was observed striding very smoothly up steep hillsides with little to no discernible effort.There have been several sighting reports within 20 miles of this location, which is southwest of Pikes Peak.",

            "Observed": "I was driving home from work a year ago, December. It was about midnight. I was driving on hwy 138 heading east about 15 miles out of Roseburg, Oregon. As I rounded a curve in the road, I saw what I thought was a deer way up ahead crossing the road. I slowed down a bit as I got to where I thought the deer would be. What I saw was a figure standing just off the road by a fence with one hand on the fencepost and it turned as I went by, watching me. I thought It was a man so I stopped to see if he needed help. I got out of my truck with my flashlight in hand and started walking back toward the \"man\". I was working the lightbeam along the fenceline when I heard the most godawful sound I've ever heard in my life! I froze. I was in the military and I work as a psychiatric nurse and I don't scare easily but that scream scared the crap out of me. It sounded like a dying calf in a hail storm..It was ranging in tone, starting out high pitched, then ending up as a threatening, low pitched, guttural sound. I dropped my flashlight and RAN back to my truck and spun tires getting out of there. The next day on my way to work, I stopped at the same spot. My flashlight was still there. I didn't notice any footprints but did see the tall grass had been walked through on the other side of the fence. I looked on all the fence posts in the area where I saw it but did not see any evidence of hair. As to what it looked like, I only got a brief look as I went by, but it had to be at least 7 foot tall. I base this on the fact that I drive a Dodge Ram truck; when I'm sitting in the driver's seat, my head is 6 feet off the ground. The spot where this thing stood is in a depression in the ground. When I park my truck in that spot and stand where it stood, I can't see into the cab at all. And yet, that night I saw it, its head was even with mine, I was looking directly out the window not slightly up or down. I couldn't make out features as it was dark but the lights of my pickup slightly illuminated the area where it stood as I went by. As I said, I thought it was a man at first who needed help. It looked so human at that moment, it wasn't until later that I came to believe it couldn't have been a man. No man could have made that sound. What I remember seeing was a figure standing next to the fence. Its head followed me as I went by. It didn't appear to have shoulders, it looked like the head just spread out until it became shoulders. It appeared to have long hair all over; at first I thought it was a long jacket like a duster, but as I look back it had to be fur. But it was the scream that stands out in my mind. It was like a warning, \"don't come closer\", at least that was the message I got!",
