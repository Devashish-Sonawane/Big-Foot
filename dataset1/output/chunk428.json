            "Observed": "In May of 1986, three friends and me went canoeing in the Boundary Water's Canoe Area Wilderness in Northeastern MN (St. Louis County). We had originally planned on doing a loop trip; beginning and ending at Moose River parking lot off the Echo Trail (County Rd 116).",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, John, about his experience. Note that the friend's names in John's written account have been changed at his request to protect their anonymity. John and two of his friends were active in the United States Air Force, and one of them brought his son.Their planned trip into the BWCAW followed the Echo Trail  which stretches north of Ely, MN to the southern area of Crane Lake, MN. Portions of the Moose River, the Agnes River, Ramshead Lake, and Nina Moose Lake, were used to enter and exit the area. Their campsite was located on the western most island of a chain of three islands on Ramshead Lake.  John went to look for a waterfall on a small river/stream that flows into the west side of Ramshead Lake. He paddled approximately 150 yards from the island to shore. After arriving at the falls he heard the sounds of a log being smacked against a tree. The sounds were approximately thirty feet into the thick brush and seemed to be going around him. He also heard grunts. Upon hearing noises behind him he felt that something wanted him out of there and he heard branches breaking as he left. From the area of the waterfalls to the campsite is approximately a 20 minute hike and canoe ride.  Upon returning to the campsite his friends wanted him to show them where he heard these sounds so the four of them set off in two canoes back to the waterfalls. While standing near the same area all four heard knocking sounds. One of them suggested that it was possibly a moose hitting its antlers against a tree. Approximately three to four minutes later they heard it on the other side of the stream. They observed nothing cross the stream and suspected there were possibly two different creatures. After hearing a loud crack Roy gave chase towards the area that the sound had come from. Approximately ten minutes later Roy was heard yelling to the group to find his way back out of the dense forest. Upon his return he told them that he felt he was being deliberately led away and they should immediately leave the area. They returned to the island around 6 PM where they collected more wood and started a campfire. They all shard a large canvas tent.  The following morning, just as the sun was coming up, two of the friends heard an extremely large splash in the water near where they beached their canoe the previous night. They then heard some movement in the water. The other two were woken up and they all hiked down to the canoe. They noticed what looked like a wet blob of a footprint approximately 14\" long and 6\" wide on the rock/gravel beach. Shortly thereafter the group packed up their equipment and left the area.  ",

            "Observed": "I've been visiting this lake since a small child, so I am familiar with the animals that live there and the sounds they make. The first time I was fishing with my father in a little cove on the lake. I heard some rustling in the woods and thought maybe there was a deer and i was looking through the trees. I didn't see anything at first but then I saw something fairly tall, I'd say between 6 and 7 foot. The only view I got of it was a profile and it was walking very quickly on 2 legs with arms swaying. I thought for a seconds it was a bear, but i noticed it did not have the ears of a bear nor did it have a snout. My dad didn't notice it (he was too intent on catching a fish) and when I told him what I thought I just saw he laughed and didn't pay much attention to what I said. I've seen bears in the area before and this shared only 2 features with the bears I've seen, It was hairy, and was large. It had hair colors ranging from dark brown to light brown and very long arms. I never saw the legs. I'm sure I could have if I had looked but I was trying too hard to catch a glimpse of the face that I never looked down.",

Regarding details of the sighting, it all happened in less than two seconds and he had to look through a lot of trees so detail was not an option.He was amazed at how fast it moved and how much ground it covered in just a few steps.  He did not know if it noticed him and he didn't feel uncomfortable,  just curious.  The sounds he heard on a later trip have yet to be determined.Nothing was seen there during the second experience..  ",
