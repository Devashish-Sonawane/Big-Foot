            "Observed": "It was late fall shortly after sundown, my girlfriend and I went for a walk down the road that ran infront of her house. The weather was cool and the sky was clear. We walked with the shoulder of the road to our right. Slighty off the road, there was a fence row about 6 feet above the level of the road. As we were walking along the road, I heard something 'tramping' around on the fence row. We got spooked. It noise continued. I just had to know what it was so I jumped up on the fence row and looked across a cut corn field. As I looked across the field, I noticed something walking along a ditch. It appeared to be tall and slender with a shaggy brown skin. I hollared at it and it stepped off into a ditch bank. We got scared and ran back to my girlfriends house.",

He described the creature as \"athletic\" looking with a definite waist. \"It wasn't just straight up and down.\" There was no discernible neck and the arms were possibly longer in proportion than those of a human. The body \"had texture\" which he assumed to be hair, but because of the light conditions he could not judge its length. He described its motion as a \"hurried walk\" with its \"arms moving with the steps.\" The tracks he found the next day in the agricultural lime dust were not well defined. No toes were visible on the tracks, but the ends looked \"squared off, not rounded like the toe area of a shoe.\"",
