            "Follow-Up Report": "6-21-05: I spoke to the witness and found him to be very credible.He stated that he and his friend had climbed down into the area and were searching for animal dens (raccoon, squirrel etc.) They had happened upon an area where they saw an animal was laying. They had thought it was a bear that had been injured due to the lack of movement and decided to leave to report it. Then the animal stood up and bolted into the opposite tree line. The witness stated that the facial features were not visible because the animal never turned to look back. It was very muscular with four to five inch neat hair. He stated at first the hair looked \"fluffy\". The witness estimated the weight to be over 500 pounds and the height to be between six and one half to seven and one half feet tall. They noticed no odor and the animal cleared the area quickly. It had a huge stride and the arms swung wide with its movements. The area where the animal was laying was matted like a deer nesting area. At that point the witnesses ran in the other direction. They returned with some friends after a couple of days to check the area, but found nothing. They did not tell the friends about the sighting.The witness went on to say that there was a cave network in the area from abandoned coal mines, but many had been covered over. There was ample water resource from the river and the foliage grew to the banks. Walnut and crabapple trees were abundant as well as large gardens planted by the locals.The witness stated that he returned to the area a few weeks ago and most of the foliage was now removed and the area was much more populous.",

            "Observed": "To this day I cannot honestly say this was a sighting or not. I will leave that conclusion to those with more knowledge of Sasquatch behavior to decide. At the time my knowledge of Sasquatch, Bigfoot or the skunk-ape was limited only to what I had seen on t.v. or read in the papers rarely. In fact, I was under the belief that the Patterson tape had been debunked and bigfoot was probably a myth. It was a clear March day and I being off from work decided to take a day hike in Rock Springs State Park. The park is not heavily used I think mainly because its reputation for a healthy black bear population keeps city dwelling day hikers well clear of it. I have hiked many time in bear country and the idea of a bear encounter wasn't a worry. I decided on a loop trail approximately 2 miles in length basically as a warm up then planned on hiking different parts of the area. The woods very basically slash pine and palmetto with clear scrub meadow and shallow swamp areas a little deeper in. A well defined trail led through the palmetto. About 1/2 a mile in I noticed the woods had become very quiet and I began to feel as if I was not alone but being watched. In the middle of the trail I came upon a very large of very fresh scat. It was directly centered in the middle of the trail and the stools were incredibly large and long approximately 3 having lengths of between 9 and 11 inches. This was not bear scat as I have seen piles of that before and never saw continuous lengths of stool such as this. Again feeling that I was not alone I developed the strangest feeling that this was there for me to find and that it was meant as a warning not to go further. The fear I felt became almost irrational but I had no doubt I should turn around and leave this area. I have spent many hours in the woods but had never felt this type of flight or fight feeling. I now know that primates have used scat to mark territory and warn others away. Could this have been a warning left by a primate to me? I honestly don't know.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness was interviewed for nearly an hour by phone on 12/18/07. He was found to be intelligent, articulate and expressive. His encounter occurred in Rock Springs State Park, in Lake County in a pine flatwoods environment. According to the witness, \"This area serves as a wildlife corridor between the Wekiva Springs State Park to the south and the Seminole State Forest to the north.\" About 1/4th of a mile from the park entrance is a pull off at the trail head of the trail where this encounter took place.  About 1/2 of a mile down the trail is where the witness began to experience what he described as \"weird feelings\". He noticed that all the normal animal sounds including birds, cicadas, and the like, had ceased. These feelings included a very strong sensation of being watched. It was immediately thereafter, just a little farther up the trail where he encountered the scat in the middle of the trail. In addition to his reported description concerning the size of the scat, he stated that it was very dark in color, and contained no visible, identifiable contents, such as undigested plant matter, berries, berry seeds, fur, or acorn shells, as one might expect if it were bear scat. It was at this time that he was overcome with an extreme feeling of dread and trepidation, as though something was saying \"get the heck out of here!\" He did exactly that, terminating his hike.  He stated that he had 30 years of experience in the woods hiking, camping, and hunting and had encountered bear scat numerous times. He stated that this specimen was very, very much larger than anything he had ever encountered.",
