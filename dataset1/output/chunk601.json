            "Follow-Up Report": "[Editor's Note (Matt Moneymaker) :Although the general rule for reports in this database is that they must be written by the witnesses themselves, the witness submission for this particular report (see above) is not entirely the original writing of the witness, but rather a more coherent version of her claims, as transcribed by investigator Richard Hucklebridge after several interviews with her.Although the mining town of Happy Camp has a long history of sighting reports, this particular witness has a long, colorful history of bigfoot related claims. She obviously seeks to draw some attention to herself and her situation, and she has been successfully at that over the past few years. Consequently, it is one of those cases that needs to be mentioned in the database, even if we consider her stories very dubious and her character a bit shakey.Her story was exploited by Tom Biscardi in 2005.  Yes, this is the location of the Internet-connected surveillance camera that Biscardi was charging a subscription for during the 2005 Coast-to-Coast AM hoax.There are various indications that this case is a \"fiction mix\" situation -- a mix of fact and fiction.  Some or many of the incidents may be misinterpretations, embellishments, or outright fabrications ... but there is likely some seed of truth in this case. Usually the motivation for a fiction mix situation is that a witness knows there are real bigfoots in the area, which *occasionally* come on the property, so as far as the witness/resident is concerned, it doesn't matter if some of his/her claims are pure fluff, as long as the goal is achieved  -- the goal of attracting enthusiastic researchers to the site. In this case a few different researchers have already come to this site over the past three years, or at least met/communicated with this woman. The consensus seems to be that there is likely some occasional activity on or near the property (she doesn't own the property, but rather rents a trailer there), but she is not a stellar witness, and much of what she claims should be taken with a grain of salt.\"Occasional BF activity on or near the property\" could apply to many properties around the town of Happy Camp ...A deceptive professional skeptic might try to make use of this woman by characterizing her as a \"typical witness,\" then debunking some of her claims in order to demonstrate some skeptical generalization about all witnesses. Whether you believe her or not, she is definitely not a typical witness.------------------------------------------------------------------Notes and Comments by Investigator Richard Hucklebridge:This has been a very long journey in an attempt to bring this report out, because this report needed to have someone from our group on site to verify certain things. I have been in contact with this witness off and on for some time now, and it has not always gone smoothly ...  but I feel this case needs to be documented and posted because we will continue to hear about this lady.On the 16th of June of 2008, my wife and I visited the site, and we talked to the witnesss about her three sightings that were turned into the BFRO. The witness, Tara, is a Native American. She feels that her encounters with this creature are a type of a religious experience. Someone may conclude that, however, even when they are really seeing actual bigfoots on occasion. My wife and I took a few pictures where, according to the lady, the creature would come down off of the mountain and exit down through the creek that ran at the lower end of her property during the spring. At the time of our visit, this creek was about 3 to 4 foot deep and about 25 to 30 feet across, and running at a good clip due to the snow run off. The witness also pointed out some very small sand bars at the edges of that creek that she/he claimed showed tracks in the past. She said the tracks showed the animal repeatedly came up and out of the creek, and on too her property.She pointed out the warm spring on her property which is located about 50 or so feet above the creek. Interestingly, the general area by the spring appears to have noticeably different flora and fauna than everywhere else. Tara claimed that the creatures would make a bed on the ferns that rimmed this little warm spring. She now cuts a trail down through the berries, and next to the little spring, so the creatures can move a little easier through her property.During her first sighting, a bigfoot was hunkered down pulling berries from the blackberry bushes with its back to her while she was on her porch. It then heard her, and turned and stood up, and looked at her, and then it started moving off down toward the creek. It was in an upright position on two legs, but it was bent over. It picked up speed in that position as it moved along. The distance from her on the porch to where it stood was about 40 feet.There are many fruit trees on her property and up and down the creek bed, because the old miners planted them over 100 years ago. The reason I am only including excerpts from her Reports # 20720 and # 12910 is because there are a few comments about other parties that Tara had dealings with, and I feel that it would inappropriate to put any of those statements on the public databse.Tara claims that various photos and casts of tracks from the location are not available because they are the subject of litigation at the moment.  On the positive side, this location where Tara lives seems to be a natural route for animals transitioning from the high country to the lower warmer elevations during the cold months.  ",
