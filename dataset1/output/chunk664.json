She also mentioned that it paused and looked before continuing across the road. She had the impression that the animal knew her car was there, but did not appear to be frightenned as it crossed the highway. She did not smell anything unusual.Note the passenger's report, Report #14144.Also note there are several other reports from both Clarke and Lauderdale counties, which border one another+:Report #1342Report #4681Report #12290Report #13347",

If you drew a line through the 2 Suwannee Co. sightings you show on this site, the line would go thru my house. A creek that feeds Rocky Creek, which is the creek featured in the Wellborn sighting runs 250 yards from my front door. Beavers have dammed it up and now there is a huge swamp as a result. I was walking near the swamp 3 days ago and found a footprint that measured 16in long. Conveniently the only camera i have is broken. Last night I heard a vocalization that would make your blood run cold. It was very similar to vacalizations on your site, though much loger in duration and higher pitched. It was followed by three thumps that sounded like wood being knocked together. I had a broken shovel handle in my flowerbed, and i responded by knoking the same pattern. It respoded with three more knocks. 30 seconds later i heard a similar vocalization much further away and lower pitched. im still freaking out.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This witness was interviewed on 11/14/07 for approximately an hour, four days after the aforementioned encounter. The following account adds additional information to the above report. -The witness was walking near his home on the edge of the road and found a large footprint that gained his immediate attention. Upon examination, he found the print of a bare right foot included a very clear heel boundary, and a clearly evident great toe. The remainder of the print was less clear due to harder packed substrate. In his astonishment, he immediately returned to his home to retrieve a measuring tape, and to bring back his mother who resides with him, to witness the print, as his camera was not in working order. The print measured 16\" in length. He did not measure the width.-Two days later, the witness was alerted from within his home by an extremely loud, very long howl that he stated may have been as long as 40 seconds in duration. He exited his house during the call, and within 30 seconds or so of its termination, he heard three distinct wood-on-wood knocks, \"bap, bap, bap\", from the direction of the howl. He also stated that his next door neighbor told him the next day that she was awakened from sleep by the intensity of the sound.-Having familiarized himself with the Bigfoot phenomenon since finding the print, he immediately grabbed a shovel and repeated the knocks in the same sequence on his railing, eliciting another knocking response within less than 30 seconds. -This was followed shortly thereafter by a second vocalization that the witness described as being lower in pitch, shorter in duration, and sounding considerably farther away; farther than the original source might have traveled in such a short length of time, inferring that the second vocalization might have been from a second source. The witness stated that he thereafter listened to the BFRO recordings on the website and identified the sound as most like the Florida Howl. -The witness stated that upon subsequent investigation in the area where the sounds came from, he found at least 15 broken trees and tree formations within a 150 yard stretch of area, mostly of oak trunks about 2\" in diameter, broken at about 6' off the ground and twisted and/or bent onto the ground or in close arrangements leaning with adjacent tree breaks. He stated that it appeared almost like a split rail fence in arrangement. He also described pieces of trees and/or small log sections wedged and stacked in the crotches of other trees, as well as saplings bent over, the tops of which were held down by a log or broken tree.-Additionally, he spoke of a friend who built a hog pen with a 6' fence containing 4 hogs, years earlier in the same area. He stated that 2 hogs disappeared in 4 days with no visible signs of escape, and upon returning one evening to the pen, the friend was charged by an 8' creature that he identified as a \"Bigfoot\". The witness stated that his friend was extremely shaken by the event, and was reluctant to speak of it.-He also reiterated several other stories from the surrounding area that were evidence of similar activity._____________This investigator found the witness to exhibit significant evidence of recounting a genuine personal experience, including veritable excitement and quick, enthusiastic responses to questions. This account, paired with other reports in the same general area, leads this investigator to conclude this to be a legitimate, true chronicle of an actual series of events involving Bigfoot creatures.",
