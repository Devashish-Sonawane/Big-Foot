On my way back to the main road, I stopped at a stop sign. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something moving in the trees. I looked over and an upright figure came out of the woods towards my car. I would estimate it was 7' to 7'5\" tall with dark brown hair with grey patches on the chest and face. I drove away, quickly, because it was coming towards my door. As I drove, in the rear view mirror I saw it cross the road in about 2 steps, then I lost sight of it.",

Our discussion included both the contents of this latest report and his original report #35297. He confirmed that the visual encounter occurred in February of 2009, and the audible incident mentioned in both reports occurred during April of 2005. The visual incident occurred about 2:00 AM while he was driving out of a subdivision on Mallard Point which extends into Lake Norfork. He was slowing for a stop sign at the intersection of Ridgecrest Drive. He then noticed a grey and white bipedal animal about 6 1/2 to 7 feet tall walking out of the woods at a fast pace directly toward the driver's side door. By the time he reacted and \"blew past the stop sign\", the figure was within a few feet of the vehicle. As he drove away he could see in his rear view mirror as the figure continued on across the road illuminated by a street light.He also stated that even though the windows were closed on the vehicle he could smell a strong skunk-like odor and urine. After speaking with the witness in person I believe he is a credible observer.",
