            "Follow-Up Report": "On this night he, a veterinarian\u0096zookeeper, was camping in a secluded area along with a preacher who has been researching sasquatch in the area for the past eight years. I met the veterinarian on a Florida expedition several years ago. Their intent that night was to do research in the area as activity has been reported on and off there for several years. The men arrived at dusk and set up a fire once the sun set, the temperatures were in the 60\u0092s. Photo of the camping area:They set their camp up on a ridge. They knew that call blasting would carry deep down into the valley. Here is a photo of the valley:Around 10 PM they began call blasting recordings of purported sasquatch sounds from StanCourtney.com.  When the recording finished, they did a few wood knocks, and immediately they heard a return knock. A few moments later they heard 3 howls that they could not identify. The howls came from the valley area as did the knocks. They came from two different sides of the valley. Approximately 30 minutes later as they sat by the fire, they heard what sounded to both of them as a \u0093very loud, human sigh\u0094 that was just beyond the perimeter of the fire light on the valley side of the camp.After a while the zookeeper walked a few feet to his truck to relieve himself.  As he did so a rock was thrown from the valley area and landed about 10 feet in front of him.  Being spooked, he backed up returning to the fire. Rock came from this area:The area has small scrub and he felt the thrower must have been low to the ground, not standing.The men sat quietly as they also \u0093felt\u0094 a presence nearby. It was another thirty minutes when they heard another \u0093loud, deep human sigh\u0094 much closer and sounding to be directly behind the zookeeper. They did not smell any odors.Around 2 AM the men retired for the night. One slept in his car, the other in his truck bed. Right at sunrise the men were awoken by another wood knock and a distant howl that was much further away in the valley than the night before.In the morning the men discovered a track line just beyond their vehicles. The tracks came from the woods, crossed the lumber road and proceeded to the valley. It appeared that whatever made them had stopped to look at a tadpole filled puddle. The tracks did not appear to be new, but more than a day or so old, however they had not noticed them the day before. The footprints measured 11.5 inches long and 4.75 inches wide. They were spaced 1 foot apart in the stride.  They had no arch, and were flat, see photos:Casts were made:In regards to the howls that the men heard, I want to emphasize that as a veterinarian and zookeeper of exotic animals this witness did not recognize the sounds as an animal he knows. Also both men attest that the \u0093sighs\u0094 heard sounded like a human male and not an animal. The track line found is the single file track we associate with a sasquatch, not the side to side human stride.",
