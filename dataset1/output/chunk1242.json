They said yes, so the three of us got into my dad's 1980 Ford Ranger F-150 which was 4 wheel drive and seemed somewhat lifted.  I would say the truck stood an easy 6 foot tall.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "This area is within 25-30 miles of my location and I am quite familiar with it.  I had a long conversation with the witness. These are the events as they happened. The witness was headed out from his parent home to take his buddies home. This area is large tracts of farmland, mostly soybean and corn and a good sized river, the Grand river with numerous tributaries. The cab of the truck was 6ft or so, about head high. His friends lived close and there were only three turns to get to his destination which was just a few miles. He saw the creature and it was walking along the road on the same side he was driving. As soon as his headlights hit it, it took a half turn towards a fence line.The creature stepped into the ditch (18 inches to 2 ft. deep). As he stated it jumped on one leg (right leg) and cleared the barbed wire fence. Fence is around 4 ft. tall so this was a jump of 6 ft. on one leg. He was driving about 20-25 miles per hour since they were slowing anyway as they approached the house. He used the truck height to gauge the height of the creature.Description: \"7ft tall at least give or take & light brown or dirty blond hair, not fur\". Total length of sighting was 3-5 seconds max. He said nothing and just kept driving, thinking he was the only one who saw it. As he stated, his brothers friend asked \" Did you just see that\"?. None of them wanted to be the first to admit to the others they had just seen \"something\" but they all DID see it. Witness is now retired military and the event is as fresh as if it happened last week. This area has numerous other reported sightings over the last several decades, and there are conservation areas and ample habitat.",
