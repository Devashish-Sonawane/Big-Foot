            "Observed": "when we toped a small hill and started down the other side, i saw a large hairy thing walking by the corn that was not taking up. I stopped the car in the road,( on this road you might see a car, one in 30 minutes), and said whats that. My wife, sitting on passenger side, looked and saw it to, my oldest son was in the back seat, but to small to remember. this thing( I call it that because no one acts like they believe) was walking to the right a couple of steps, turned and took 3 steps to the left, turned and walked back the way we first saw it, it was taller than the corn stalks, hairy, dark brown or black, it was swinging it arms as it walk and slightly leaning fowards, ( the film of the bigfoot they show on t.v. is the same, but I dont remember it looking at us). we watched it until it walked into the trees by the creek. We turned right in the small road that goes to her parents house. we stopped on the other side of the trees with the creek in the middle and did not see it again. we went to the house and told her parents. We ask ourselve`s even today why we did not go and look for it or tracks. I think my father in law and i where going deer hunting?",

Straight in front of her is an open field with trees on the edge of it and a creek after the trees. After she stopped at the stop sign she noticed several deer running very fast. She then noticed a large creature running after them. She stated it was very, very tall on 2 legs and very, very hairy. The deer and the bigfoot ran into the trees. She was scared and was home in minutes. We live about 2 miles from where she saw bigfoot. She told Dad & I what happened. I explained to her what she had seen and told her that she was lucky to see it because not everybody gets to see them. Of course she didn't feel that way.",
