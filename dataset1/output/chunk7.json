I don't remember where I got them now, but I honestly believe that whatever sound came out of them while I was driving was what caused this creature to be so blatant about running across the road in front of us.  Otherwise, it could have easily stayed where it came from and I would have completely driven by it without even knowing that it was there.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. His verbal report was consistent with his written report. During our conversation he recalled these additional details:The creature was standing on the left side of the road and ran on two legs across the road to his right. He estimates that it was 6 feet plus in height and was built very powerfully. It moved very quickly with a smooth gait. He did not recall any smell or facial features. The distance between it and his car was several car lengths, and he did not believe he was traveling very fast during the encounter. The weather was clear and calm and the time was around 8:30 am. He felt strongly that the deer whistles on his car alerted the creature and might have contributed to the aggression it showed when shaking the tree after crossing the road. He did clearly see the tree shake violently but did not actually see the creature do the shaking.I did a search of the area on Google Earth and found that the forest was much thicker in the direction that the creature ran. The North Fork of the San Gabriel River was less than 1/2 mile away.I found the witness to be very sincere and credible and believe he had an encounter with a bigfoot.",
