Then, in my middle rear view mirror, I saw a sasquatch peak around a tree about 60 feet away. It watched me for about 30 seconds, then very slowly walked to another tree about 20 feet away from the first tree. Then again, it watched my car for about 30 seconds. Because of the back tinted window, the reflection, the shady light, and my high headrests I don't think it could see me.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I was able to talk to this gentleman on the phone. I asked him to tell me what happened during the reported encounter, which occurred on Nov. 12th, 2013. He said that he uses his vehicle as a blind for calling-in coyotes. He was sitting there for about 30 minutes quietly listening, and then made some calls with his predator call. After calling, he sat there for another 30-40 minutes listening and watching. Then, looking in his rear-view mirror, he noticed a large, hairy, bi-pedal creature peek out from behind a tree that was behind his SUV. It could not see him due to tinted windows. He said that after watching him for a short time, it moved to a different tree. As it moved, it walked slouched-over, looking at its feet as if watching where it placed its feet. It peeked around the tree for about 30-40 seconds, and then just disappeared from view. He said that a cow elk then crossed-behind his vehicle at approximately the same place. This gave him a comparison to judge the height of the creature, which he estimated to be 6\u0092 tall. He said that the color was black, but other than that, the lighting was such that he did not get any more detailed detail about its hair or facial features. The behavior described is consistent with other sasquatch reports. The area has generated many reports over the years. I have personally followed-up on nine of them. Given the other reports from the area, and the behavior described, as well as the description provided by the witness, it is highly probably that he did see a sasquatch.",
