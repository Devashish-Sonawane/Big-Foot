            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was sitting around a campfire around 11 p.m. with some friends and family when he and his friend's son decided to go fishing.  It was a beautiful, clear, 70 degree night and the lake was calm.  They launched their boat near the northwest shore of Jewell Lake and headed south, down the shoreline about 200 yards from their cabin.  They were about 50 yards from the shoreline, casting toward the shore using hula popper lures.  Three different casts brought a startling experience as a huge rock hit the water right near where the hula popper had surfaced.  \"These were huge rocks!  They were large enough to make a 'kerplush' sound when hitting the water.\"  The first rock hit about 20 yards away from them, but the third rock hit the water about 10 yards away from the boat.  At this point, the two fishermen decided to head back in.  \"I am an avid hunter and I am familiar with what is out in the woods.  No man could have thrown those large rocks that kind of distance!\"  The witness reported that just prior to the rocks being thrown, they did hear movement on the ridge just above the shoreline.  The witness has been fishing on Jewell Lake for nearly forty years and had never had any experience like this before.  He stated that there were not a lot of people at the cabins or on the lake that day, and he felt like they were probably the only ones on the lake that night.  He also stated that if it were kids messing with them, they probably would have heard other noises in the woods like giggling or running away or movement noises.  He couldn't see anything on the shoreline and he has no explanation for what occurred that night.  After the third rock hit, \"the hair on the back of my neck stood up!\"  Both fishermen decided it was time to get off the lake.  They returned to the cabin with no further incidents.  All this happened within a 10 minute time frame.Jewell Lake is located in the Huron National Forest.  There is abundant wilderness areas around the lake with plenty of cover, large game and small game.  This incident occurred in an area where there is a dense forest covering most of the western shoreline with minimal lake access.",
