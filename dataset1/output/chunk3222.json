            "Observed": "June 1994, West bank Chopaka Lake, 2-3am.  I awoke to the most god-awful \"animal\" voice I've ever heard. My friends slept through it and teased me the next day when I described the sounds. However, they stayed the next night after I left and reported to me later that they were awakened as I had been and were quite frightened by the same sounds at around the same time. Just today I first heard of sightings by others at the lake in '96.  The sound I heard was very loud, echoing across the lake and the hill on the east shore.  It originated from the NW corner of the lake. The \"call\" was a good 10 secs long each time starting off with a very low register bellow like the bellow of a bull or elephant, then morphing into a cougar-like snarl and then finishing similar to an eagle screech, several octaves rise in a single voicing! There were a couple obnoxious bulls in the area in the daytime but their bellowing was normal and familiar.",

The hair stood up on the back of my neck. It was a low growl that progressed to a loud inhuman scream that was higher in pitch than the first of the growl/scream.  I remained motionless.  The sound came from a creek bed about 300 yards from my location. After a few moments I heard it again.  I speculated that it could be some drunk person screaming his lungs out but the timbre was not human in its low or high end of the auditory spectrum.",
