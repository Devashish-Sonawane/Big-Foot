The marks were very noticible, about 6 inches in length and were half way around the tree. As I recall, there was a record Black Bear killed on Lampa Mt in the mid 1970's. Frank and I assumed we were seeing evidence of such a bear. This incident would have occured about 1978.",

It was rather flat in profile, and then it raised its front legs or arms almost infront of its body as it ran, and very rapidly climbed the road cut... and I mean VERY RAPIDLY. Its body also appeared to be very strong... the impression I will always have is that it was a running back in a furry suit carrying a football! I say this because of the relative size of the shoulders versus the waist and the speed it had. I am trying to recall how many steps it took to cross the road... and I am thinking 4-5 steps from the right side to the edge of the road cut along the left side of the road, then a few steps up and out of sight.\" ",
