            "Observed": "I stopped at a Nature Preserve to hike. On my way in, I had passed at least 14 people at various ways on their way out. I had walked down across the bridge and was looping back and it was about 4pm, As I was rounding a bend, I heard something big run away in the woods. I thought I had scared a deer and continued on. This is when I rounded the bend and saw a print on the trail going the opposite direction of whatever I heard scamper away. The ground was hard and the print was only about 1/4\" in the dirt. There were no other people prints or anything on the trail, As I'm taking pictures, something crashes in the trees above me... I covered my head waiting for a big branch to fall on me. After that, I high tailed it out of there. I left passing another half a dozen people on their way in as I made my way out. I never expected or was looking for anything on such a populated path. If it wasn't for the fact I had heard something right before and right after I found the print, I would have seriously leaned toward a fake.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Update: On July 1, Investigator Marc DeWerth and myself went to the location for an on-site investigation. Track was still visible and congruent with the witness' recount  and submitted photos. Photos were taken for documentation purposes. Measurements are as follows:Length: ~18.5\"Toe width: ~7.75\"Heel Width: ~6.5\"The track was not cast due to normal erosion, time elapse and recent heavy rains. We took the following photos:The witness felt like there was two separate individuals around him as he could hear heavy movement to both sides of him. He was truly terrified during the event which caused him to panic and flee the area. Having vast experience in this part of Fairfield county and having a vast knowledge of all the close by nature preserves, I would not be surprised of the possibility. There is a nice convergence of creeks (Buck Run) a few miles down eventually leading to the Hocking River and down through the Wayne National forest.The photos submitted to us by the witness:",

            "Observed": "In mid August to early September 1998, G.G. and friend reported to me that during this 3 to 4 week time period they were setting animal traps for their fur trade hobby. During this period, usually during the evening hours, these men would hear ear piercing cries in the forest around them. They had no clue what was making the screams, but were very impressed by the volume and intensity of the screams. At some point, the screams were almost musical, kinda like whistling. About a week before the actual sighting in the area they were frequenting, they noticed 3 or 4 very large five toed human like footprints in the soft soil going up the hillside. He estimated the tracks were at least 15 inches long with huge strides even going up the hillside. Finally, on a very quiet afternoon, the men encountered the track maker. They observed it at a distance of about 100 feet. It was covered with medium length brown hair all over its' body except its face. It watched them for a few seconds, then took off up the hillside into the forest away from them. Both men agreed it had a low forehead, small dark eyes, huge hands, bulky body and a nasty smell. After the incident, the men collected the last of there traps and have not returned since.",
