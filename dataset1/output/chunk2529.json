I was on an old logging road and was watching a cleared area for deer when from across the draw I observed someone come out of the tree line on the other side of the draw. At first I thought it was a very large man as it seemed to move as one, walking quite comfortably as though it were strolling on a road. I am aware of the roads in this area and was surprised to see that there was a road there. As I looked closer I realized this \"PERSON\" was far taller than a human and the strides while walking were quite long. It seemed to move along as though on a hard flat surface which is why I had the impression at first that there was a road there.",
