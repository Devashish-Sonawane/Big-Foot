A few years back two friends and I saw The exact figure that was displayed while driving in The mountains of bountiful ut. All three of us will give you the exact same account. Even if interviewed apart. For years we joked about big foot till I saw that movie. The creature started off crouched on the of a steep hill on the side of the road as I turned on my brights it stood up, ran across The road and vanished up the mountain into thick trees.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness about this sighting and visited the location for an onsite inspection. All three witnesses agree about the story and what they saw and that it was a clear sky and visibility was good with a bright moon.  The witnesses drove their truck around the curve of the mountain road and saw a dark figure crouched down, on the side of the road to their left. It was about ten yards off of the road and approximately thirty yards in front of the truck. They slowed down not sure if it was an animal and afraid it would dart into the road. The figure stood up on two legs, facing away from them, turned towards the road and walked across in front of the truck and then ran up the steep hillside on the truck's right hand side. It was visible for more than a hundred yards until it disappeared into thick timber. The animal was dark in color with noticeable hair hanging from its arms and legs. The witnesses couldn't estimate a height of the animal other than it was much larger than a human. They all thought it looked similar to the animal and the sequence they saw of the dash cam video on Finding Bigfoot.After inspecting the location I determined the hillside the animal ran up would be impossible for a human to navigate without scrambling on all fours, let alone run up. This range of mountains has a history of sightings with a noticeable increase of sightings at the lower elevations during the winter months when the higher elevations are heavy with snow. Based on the sincerity and number of witnesses, the proximity to the animal and the history of sightings in the area, I believe this is a Class A sighting.",
