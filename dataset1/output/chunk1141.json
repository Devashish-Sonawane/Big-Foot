He stated the events above and said he first heard what he thought was a deer or squirrel quietly rustling around on the other side of the hill.   He estimates the diameter of the tree that violently shook and swayed to have been between 12 and 14 inches in diameter and whatever was shaking it had to possess great strength. The witness has since purchased a cottage in the area and said he will take me to the location the next time he is up for a weekend.  I will update this report if I find any evidence at that time. This seems to have been a possible intimidation or a territorial threat display to get the hunters out of the area.This witness wanted to tell his story and have it published so that others in the area who may have had similar experiences will come forward.  He thinks many people may have had a similar encounter and never tell anyone, not knowing what to make of it. ",
