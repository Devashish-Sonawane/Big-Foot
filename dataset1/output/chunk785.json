            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the US Park Service ranger who took the actual report from the witness in 1994.  Based on the location and the description in the report I suspect the witness did see a sasquatch on Hwy 12 near Packwood.  I attempted to contact the actual witness, biologist  Jim Fielder, via telephone using the phone number noted on the original form.  The phone number now belongs to someone else.The biologist was very confident about what he observed. The ranger was confident that the biologist was credible and was correctly interpreting what he was looking at.  I am very confident that the ranger is credible (because he has some official documentation), so this report should be classified as Class A, even though it is a second hand report. The BFRO's report rating system (i.e. Class A / Class B / Class C) essentially rates the potential for reliability or observational misinterpretation. Second-hand reports of sightings would normally be classified as \"Class C\" because they are typically different than the first-hand versions. Even though this is a second hand report, the potential for misinterpretation is very low with this one, so it should be considered a Class A report.",
