            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. He is who he says he is \u0097 a reitired army vet. He is credible. The main question with this report is whether he misidentified a human at that distance \u0097 140 yards.One test that anyone can do in these circumstances is to open the phone app \u0093Google Earth \u0093 (free). Zoom in on your own street or where ever you have a view for at least a block. Use the ruler function to set a point where you are standing then measure to a point 420 feet away (140 yards). At 420 feet you would be able to see an illuminated figure well enough to see if it\u0092s a bear, or if it is wearing clothes or appears to be covered with fur.During the conversation he mentioned that the face appeared to be a slightly lighter color of skin that the cinnamon brown hair, but beyond that he could not discern facial details. Check that yourself at 420 feet. Can you see if a person\u0092s face is lighter color than hair, but not much more.The creature was 30-40 feet from nearest house. It was illuminated by a light in back of the house. It was pacing back and forth 20-25 feet span. It had a very smooth gait when pacing back and forth. He said it had shaggy \u0093Twisted Sister hair.\"A deep ravine was right behind where it was pacing. Lots of deer come around these houses at night. Most land around there is posted \"No Hunting.\" He could only see the figure from the hips up, below that it was obscured by rise in ground between him and spot where it was pacing. There was no snow on ground at the time...",
