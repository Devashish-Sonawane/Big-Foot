            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness, CS, to discuss the details of his experience along the banks of the Little Pee Dee River in the Lowcountry section of SC.  This secondary road is through a vast section of swamp between Mullins & Myrtle Beach, SC and at the area of the witness' sighting, there are 3 bridges which cross over the Little Pee Dee.  As he describes, the road embankment drops steeply into the swamp on both sides of the road. The woods run right up to the embankment and offer a quick pathway into the swamp for any wildlife crossing over the road.  There are many deer, turkey, raccoon, opossum, and a vast assortment of fish and vegetation for food sources in this swampy abode. The climate is temperate, but during the summer months the humidity can be quite brutal. The human population is sparse and made up mostly of small farms and mobile homes until you get closer to the beach.Just past the spot of this sighting is a dirt road to the left when heading south on Hwy 317.  This forest road meanders off into the dismal swamp where few dare to venture except during hunting season or the occasional fisherman. I ventured down this roadway close to dusk looking for sign of any activity.  There were many game trails zig-zagging off into the mixture of scrub pine trees and cypress trees.  I looked for tracks. There were plenty of deer!  No other sign.  I find CS's story to be credible and that this was the perfect spot to have an encounter with our \"Big Friend\", especially along this deserted road at this time of night.  As CS crossed over that bridge that night the road stretches out into a long straightaway and affords you time and a good view to see down the embankment just as he described.  His story adds credence to the other sightings throughout the swamps and rivers bordering North and South Carolina.  There are multiple reports all within an hour of his sighting.  CS has provided additional insight into our research in this area and we appreciate him coming forward with his experience.  ",

            "Observed": "On this day, myself, a friend, Eddy and 2 girls, felt like taking a ride. Before I begin I just want it noted that there was NO drinking or the use of drugs. We decided to go to Plum Island. At the time, the refuge was free to enter and the entire road was dirt. That day there was no one in the refuge, as we drove down the road,  I noticed no cars the entire 6.3 miles of the refuge, it was empty, we drove to the end.  At the last small area to park, I pulled in, across the road was a narrow boardwalk that lead to a 50 foot observation tower. We all went up. We hung around up there for about a half hour, I started hearing noises, first I heard clicking, loud clicking, then short high pitched screams, it sounded maybe 100 yards away. I took a look around, but didn\u0092t see anything.  I noticed there was no one in the area.  I saw no birds or waterfowl.  The sounds went on for about 10 minutes or so, I felt uneasy at this point and said we should go. We all got in my car and started back out. I was only driving for a couple of minutes and I saw a very large dark figure cross the road from the marsh/brush area on the left to the right, which had heavy brush and that lead to the beach.  I immediately looked at Eddy and asked \u0093did you see that?\u0094  He answered \u0093Yes!\u0094 We asked each other what it was. The girls in the back seat didn\u0092t see anything s they were to busy talking to each other. I slowed to almost a stop where what we saw it cross the road, there was solid brush that it went into, we could see where something went through the brush. There was no sign of  it, it was gone. The figure that crossed was huge, 7 feet or more, very wide, all black from head to toe. It was a little hunched forward as it walked upright. I noticed its arms were longer than average and they swung as it walked.  It took only three steps to cross the road. The road is about three cars wide. It had a smooth stride. It did not look in my direction,  just crossed the road and it was gone. I only saw it for about 5 seconds I could never forget the image of it crossing the road.",
