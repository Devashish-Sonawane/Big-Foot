            "Follow-Up Report": "A 30 minute phone interview was conducted with the witness who now lives out of state. The interview produced the following additional information.The witness and two friends were picking berries approximately 50-75 feet off the track and down in a gully and did not hear the creature approaching on the tracks.  The bipedal animal was first sighted at a distance of approximately 50 yards as it was walking along the tracks toward the group.  The witness and friends, being young children, believed the animal to be a man in a monkey costume and did not feel frightened or threatened and so they remained in the gully below the tracks and continued to watch the approaching animal.  The witness reported that he thought that the creature did not see the group until it was approximately 25 yards away. At this point, the bipedal animal turned its entire upper torso and head toward the group, maintaining eye contact with the group for approximately five seconds until it passed the point on the tracks directly in front of the group. The animal made no vocalizations as it passed and no strong odor was noticed. As the animal walked past the group, the witness noted that the animal had a slightly forward leaning posture and a slightly pointed head with the crown of the head higher than the forehead.  The witness reported that the animal was tall, lanky but not massive and walked with a continuous arm sway. The creature\u0092s walking speed and stride frequency appeared to remain constant throughout the entire sighting. The animal continued to walk north along the tracks until it disappeared out of view.The area of the sighting is along the forested banks of the Lower Housatonic River Region which is characterized by very steep mountainsides that quickly rise to 500 foot hilltops. Through this region runs the Paugussett trail, an old trail named after the Native American tribe that once inhabited the area.We receive numerous reports near railroad tracks.  It is possible that these creatures use the tracks as easy travel routes.",
