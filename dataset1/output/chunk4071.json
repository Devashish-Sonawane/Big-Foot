            "Observed.1  ": "Lamberson continued that the reporting party was unsure if it was a person or possibly a bear. According to Lamberson, the person making the report said, \u0093He had seen this thing on an opposite bank of the lake and it swam across the lake and proceeded to follow him as he left in his truck. He was unsure what the thing was, a person or animal.\u0094 \u0093He said it was approximately six-and-a-half feet tall and very large. Very, very hairy,\u0094 said Lamberson of the report. \u0093It was covered in black and brown hair, and you couldn\u0092t even see a face, it was so hairy.\u0094 The reporting party said they spotted the object between eight and eight thirty in the evening, so there was some visible light yet. Lamberson has alerted the Mahaska County Sheriff\u0092s Office and the Iowa DNR about the report. Lamberson said that through his discussions, there have been no other reports of anything unusual. Mahaska County Sheriff Russ Van Renterghem had no comment or additional information on the report.",
