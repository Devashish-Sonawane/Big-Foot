            "Follow-Up Report": "This report came to me directly, and I encouraged the reporting party (RP) to submit this report to the BFRO website. On 07.14.16, nine days after the incident, I met with the RP and we went to the location and re-created the incident.  The following can be added:-  Even after nine days, the depressions in the tall grass where the creature passed were clearly visible.-  It was not possible to get an accurate measurement of the foot size, but the length of the stride was clearly longer than what a human could achieve.-  Based on our re-creation, the figure would have been in the 8' tall range, standing erect.-  The distance was far enough that no detail could be discerned, but it would have been obvious if the figure would have been a human.  It was far larger and bulkier than a human, and moved faster than a human could run.-  The RP has been a squatcher for 17 years, and is a former BFRO Investigator.  This is his first actual sighting.  I spent approximately fours hours with the RP that afternoon, and since then I have spent several nights in the field with him researching at other locations.  I find him to be extremely credible, and have no reason to doubt his account of what he saw.",

We took I-40 to Heneretta Ok. and then went South on the Indian Nation Turnpike, when my daughter 17yrs. said \"mom I think I just seen Bigfoot or something walking into the woods, I asked her what was it and she stated that whatever she saw looked like a man but had brownish hair all over it's body. I asked her did she see it's face and she said she could only see the back of it's head walking into the trees, she said it caught her attention because the trees in that area didn't have branches or leaves on the bottom part of the tree only at the top, so she could see it real good. I didn't think much about it until we were on our way back home and as we approached the area where she said she saw something I noticed a sign that said, \" Eufaula Exit\" and then I remembered seeing a special on cable about Bigfoot sightings in Oklahoma and one of the places that talked about was Eufaula.",
