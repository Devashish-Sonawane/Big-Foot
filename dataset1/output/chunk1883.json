            "Follow-Up Report": "I met with the witness at his residence and he and his father-in-law recreated the events of the evening in question. Five days prior to this incident the witness reported finding a trackway with large footprint like tracks that had a long stride length in his backyard. Because of this he kept vigilant around his house at night. One evening while out on his back deck he spotlighted a creature in a distant field. After going inside to retrieve his father-in-law, they both tried to find the creature in the field again but now with two spotlights. Not seeing anything the two men drove down to the field that's located approximately 300 yards from the witness' house and pulled into a small dirt road that leads to a pond with a large, thick and high patch of reeds. The two found the creature again. It appeared to be hiding in the patch of reeds. They both had their spotlights on it now and observed the creature's eyes moving back and forth through the reeds. Initially it was standing up but soon after being spotlighted again it dropped to a much lower level.After observing it for a length of time they returned home. During subsequent daylight investigations (both by themselves and with me present) it appeared that the creature was utilizing a slight depression to move around in the reeds. The top of those reeds were approximately 10' tall. The witness estimated the eyes to be approximately 7.5-8' tall. I saw a video of the tracks, it was low quality and does not show enough detail to share.The area of the sighting is a combination of suburbs, small woodlots, and mostly open agricultural fields. Approximately two miles to the north lies one of the ridges of the Appalachian Chain which is very heavily forested for miles and miles. ",

I was busy cutting off knots from the already cut chunks of wood and my husband was running the noisy chainsaw. Over the noise of the chainsaw I heard a loud snap (brush) and looked over in the direction it came from and saw nothing.  I had seen cattle in the area just prior to that but they all ran off when the chainsaw started.  No cattle in sight.  About an hour later I went over to the pickup truck to get a drink of water and started hearing noises I've not heard in the mountains before.  I was raised deep in the mountains so am very familiar with forest sounds.",
