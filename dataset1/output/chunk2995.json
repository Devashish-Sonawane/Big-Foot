            "Observed": "I was 18 and a senior at Columbus East High school at the time this occured.   There is a park directly across the street from my house. It  was a warm spring  night. I was doing a report for school and it was getting rather late and I was the only person still up at the time. I was, to my best guess, 1:30 AM. I had just broken my last pencil and I needed another one to finish my report. I had to go outside to my car to get one. I had just shut the door to my truck to go back inside when i hear the most God-awful schrill scream in my life. I turned around quickly and could make out the vague outline of a large man-like creature running throught the park and back into the woods. The scream lasted for about six seconds. Needless to say I high tailed it back into the house. I told my parents in the morning and they said that they had hear nothing and that I all I hear was  a cat. The next day I pulled up a bigfoot website and listened to some wav files and the sounds that I heard were identical to what I had hear the previous night.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Some considerations regarding this report and its location, along with additional information provided by the witness during the interview, are shown below.The general location for this report is east of some active locations in Brown County, Indiana. In addition, it lies close to a possible corridor of travel, namely, a stream that runs north - south.The estimation of the witness regarding the proximity of the target species when it vocalized near him was approximately 50-60 yards.  When he saw the figure he didn't have much viewing time, and it was outlined or backlit from the moonlight.  However, he offered the following observations.The witness feels that the figure was approximately seven feet in height. His view was from approximately 100 yards, but it is worth mentioning that the observer was a high school athlete familiar with the sizes of competitors at various distances. Regarding what he saw, he stated that it was very broad. There was muscularity; he could see that the area of  the trapezius muscle was huge. He thought it was similar to an NFL linebacker but with a medium, not heavy, build. He guessed a weight of perhaps 450 pounds.In addition, except for its vocalization (which best matched the Ohio and Washington wav files), it was very silent.Finally, he thought he had it in view for around two to three seconds, long enough to see open hands and the general coloration (cinnamon brown). The hair on it looked uniform in length. He also noted  a dome-like head between the shoulders.",

            "Observed": "A friend and I decided to go hiking on the Fiery Gizzard trail in the Spring of 2000 or 2001.  We were hiking back to the trailhead through the gorge near the Fiery Gizzard creek when suddenly the woods literally erupted in the loudest screaming/whooping/whooing noise I have ever heard in my life.  There was definitely more than one of whatever was making this racket because I remember hearing screaming above the background of whooping and whooing sounds.  I remember thinking at the time that it sounded like one of the indian attack scenes in \"The Last of the Mohicans\" movie.  This went on for about 5 seconds and then complete silence.  I expected to hear someone laughing or running off but there was no sound of any kind.  I asked my friend \"What the hell was that?\"  He said it was probably boy scouts.  There isn't a boy scout alive with the lung capacity to make the noises we heard that day and we hadn't seen many other people if any on the trail that day as I remember. Nothing else unusual occurred for the rest of the way out.  I have hiked this area many times since this incident with nothing unusual happening.",
