I had just awakened from a nap-i was riding in the back seat-and I looked out the window to see about where we were. I had noticed that there was a power line trail on a hill that was near the hwy we were driving on. Next to a power line pole was the silhouette of something large. I say silhouette because the sun was on it's way to setting, causing the side that was facing me of whatever was standing there to be shadowed. Within a second of me spotting it, it ducked to it's left into the wood line. This was not a bear-the shoulders were clearly defined and it looked to large to be a person.  Now a short background of myself, I am prior military, have never done drugs, and have been around woods all my life. My attention to detail is immaculate and I know when something is out of place. I know what I saw and will stand by my story. Also as an avid bigfoot follower/believer I have a habit of checking power line trails when passing by. To me, there is no other explanation-i have no doubt that was sasquatch.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "The Navy veteran was riding in the back seat with family on Hwy 259 south, toward Octavia in the Kiamichi Mountains.  Over his lifetime, the witness is from this area and has heard numerous stories of bigfoot and the famous 'Siege' at Honobia. Having read that Sasquatch sometimes walk power line trails, he is in the habit of looking for them when he passes one. He was amazed to look out the window and see a dark brown, large shouldered, bipedal figure standing next to the wood line. From the west side of the car, the creature was standing on a small hill.  The witness described it as having an \u0093athletic, Olympian swimmer\u0094 type body \u0096 wide shouldered, tapered down to a smaller waist, with long arms. Google earth image of the area:The creature was standing \u0093frozen,\u0094 about 4 feet from the trees. It was not standing up straight, but \u0093hunched down,\u0094 with bent knees, as if was trying to hide.  The witness felt the sound of the car surprised the Sasquatch. Once the car was almost past, it then \u0093glided\u0094 into the woods with one step, heading north. The dark brown color seemed uniform; the angle of the sun didn\u0092t allow him to see facial details. He also noticed that the creature had a rounded head, and appeared to not have a neck.",
