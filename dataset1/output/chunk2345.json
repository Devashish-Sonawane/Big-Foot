The weather was not good as it was snowing and dark out.  I was driving about 12 to 15 miles per hour. At first I thought that it was a person getting out of the car infront of us.  This struck me as odd considering the weather and the time of night, not to mention the location.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After one long conversation and another follow-up thereafter, it appears probable to me that this witness's account provides some corroboration and further details to a few other accounts of this incident published elsewhere, including one witness account and one reportedly from the follow-up on a call to the Park County Sheriff's Department. Although there are a few apparent possible discrepencies between accounts, that is not to be entirely unexpected and, since the reports are basically complementary and seem to be referring to the same incident, I concluded it worthwhile to add this account to the record as well.The location of the incident was previously thought to have been just east of the top of Kenosha Pass. This witness was certain as to the exact location of their and the other multiple-vehicles sighting and road-crossing. As opposed to the wooded summit, this sighting was actually down below and just to the southwest of Kenosha Pass on the flats of the South Park valley and approximately halfway between Jefferson and the sharp turn in the highway that is the beginning of the climb of the hill just below the pass itself.The submitting witness, a longtime carpenter and cabinetmaker, was driving very slowly due to the inclement weather conditions and the other slow traffic. Upon further consideration, he estimated that he was following about 25 yards behind the car in front of him when he saw that car's brake lights come on and then briefly saw a large dark figure which was just in front of that car and on the right shoulder of the road. That car then immediately passed the roadside figure. He first thought \"Why is someone getting out of the car here, now, and in these conditions?\" The figure was walking toward them as they approached, still on the right shoulder on the edge of the road. A oncoming car was at about 25-30 yards and almost stopped when the figure split the distance between the two vehicles and quickly crossed the road from the right to the left to the west at just about 15 yards or so in front of them, according to his best estimate. The witness then quickly thought it may have been someone wearing a parka with a pointed hood but immediately dismissed that thought when confronted with the evenly dark-coloring and sheer size of the figure. \"It was staggering how big this thing was,\" he said, also emphasizing that it was thick and massive. Despite the snowing and blowing conditions, the figure was brightly illuminated by both his and the oncoming vehicles headlights, giving them a good view of what was before them. His attention was also particularly struck by what looked to him to be the disproportionately large hands, or hand, of the creature. Also,  he noted that he was all but certain that it completely crossed the road in just three large steps. In estimating the size of the creature, he said the figure was much taller than his own height of 5'11,\" that it must have been two-feet taller than the top of his Toyota truck, and because it was much larger than his 6'6\" father-in-law that wears a size 13 shoe and could only almost stride across the road in five exaggerated steps, he felt confident that it was approximately 8' tall or perhaps even larger.He was certain of what they saw and insisted that at least the two other cars nearby had to have seen it as well. \"We know the car in front of us saw it, and the oncoming car was almost stopped. They saw it.\"They completely lost sight of it as they passed where it crossed off the road and into the darkness. After a long pause, they immediately agreed as to what they had just seen. The only disagreement between them is that they can't be certain as to the exact date of this incident, but he believes it is correct and it seems to fit with the other accounts.David Petti",

It was going on about 500 when I heard what sounded like a log being hit with another log.  I brushed it off as something going on up at the new construction site on top of the hill.  About 520 am I heard something walking back and to my left toward the top of the hill I was sitting on.  I was about 1/4 of the way up the hill and this was near the top where I heard it.  I knew the walking was bipedal and at this point in time I got very angry about somebody tresspassing and ruining my day of deer hunting.",
