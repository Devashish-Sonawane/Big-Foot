            "Observed": "I was deer hunting alone and had been in my stand about 15 minutes, when I heard someone approach.I spoke loudly that this was private land when a smell of a heavy musky smell hit me and whatever it was began to run circles around me, about 75 yards away. I coul see a dark shape, but it was misty and still a little dark. After about 4-5 minutes it turned and ran off. Noone has ever believd me, but I encountered the smell several other times, which I can say smelled like a wet bear, which I now pursue frequently.That was the only time anywhere that I felt not in control even though I had my rifle.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "   I spoke with the witness by phone. He said that after the animal circled him several times it stopped and \"sort of shuffled around in the leaves, back and forth, like it was trying to get my scent or something.\" The witness was located 12 to 15 feet up in a bowstand at the time. He estimated it's height as between seven and eight feet, although he never actually got a clear look at the creature. The creature made no vocalizations.    The creature had a \"very heavy tread\".  He described the odor as \"between that of a bear and wet dog\". The witness now lives in Montana and is a bear hunter. A few weeks later he took a friend hunting in the same area. The friend reported the same odor, although he did not see anything.The witness also noted that the area of his stand had many White Oak trees and that the year was a particularly good acorn crop.This report was originally submitted to the Texas Bigfoot Research Center.

            "Observed": "My son and I were turkey hunting on BLM land near Fort Carson, CO. We arrived in the area around 0930hrs. My son is only 3 and 1/2 years old, so we were moving slowly to find a good spot to set up. We were approximately 500 yards off the west side of Sate Hwy 115 in the Table Mountain area. We found a decent site to set up on and started our hunt. I called a few times with my diaphram calls and we heard one turkey gobble about 100yds away. My sun was busy playing with rocks right next to our site. At about 1030hrs I noticed a truck driving down a dirt road that runs through the area. I watched the truck drive through the area and as it turned down a left hand bend in the road, I caught some movement out the corner of my right eye. The movement was approximately 600yds away. I picked up my binoculars to get a better look, hoping it was a turkey coming in to my calls. When I got focused on the object, it definately appeared larger than a turkey, so I checked it out more and focused the lenses better. What I saw, I don't know for sure, but it appeared to be walking upright on its hind legs and and was covering a great deal of ground in a short span of time but was not running. I estimated the being to be approximately 6-7ft in height. It was walking northwest from my location. After about a minute or two it disappeared into some high brush and thickets. That terrain went up and over a little rise. I did not see anything else after that. We left the area about an hour later. I was shakin a little bit from excitement, but didn't want to hang around too much longer. I have told no one of this thinking myself to be a little crazy at the time, but I know I wasn't seeing things and it actualy hapened. I only tell this now to get it off my chest and let you guys determine if what I have said and seen is true or not. The temperature was warm and the sky was clear and sunny.",
