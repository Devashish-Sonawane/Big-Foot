            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with two of the adult witnesses over the phone for about thirty minutes. They were able to recall a few more details about their close encounter.The adult male witness said the color of the animal was either a very dark brown or black. It was huge with extremely wide shoulders. He said it was over half as wide as the Bronco he was driving. The animal stood about one foot taller than the six foot tall witness, as viewed from the road with the animal standing just off the road in the borrow pit. Given a two foot deep borrow pit, the animal\u0092s height is estimated to be about nine feet. He added that the animal chased their Bronco, which was going as fast as thirty miles an hour. He said it ran alongside the vehicle in the borrow pit and crossed the road behind the vehicle at some points. The witness stated that the road was graveled and winding, making even thirty miles per hour difficult to drive safely. From the time he first faced the animal, the witness could hear it making a strange growling whine noise. It kept this up while running with the Bronco.One of two adult female witnesses, the driver\u0092s fianc\u00e9e, confirmed the above details. She had a better view than the driver did once they began to drive away, and added some physical details. She said the animal\u0092s arms were quite long \u0096 more than half the total body length. The hair was very thick and a little bit longer than a bear\u0092s. While running, the animal was looking in at the vehicle\u0092s occupants from no more than twenty feet away. In the darkness, no facial or anatomical details were visible. She stressed that the animal was very large and fast. It had no trouble keeping up with the vehicle. She said that all the passengers were terribly frightened, screaming, and crying with fear.The female witness mentioned another incident in July 2006, which may be connected to the above sighting. While driving with her fianc\u00e9 and his daughter in the mountains of Clark County, the daughter looked out the window and said, \u0093there\u0092s a naked black man running through the hills.\u0094 The two adults paid no attention to this remark and attributed it to childhood fancy. In retrospect now, both adults wonder if she might have seen the same or a similar animal encountered in November 2006. The two locations are about sixty miles apart.",

            "Observed": "I heard 2 distinct wood knocks in am area that I had hunted for 7 years. I sit on the ground at the exact same spot every year. It was the saturday after thanksgiving around 9am sunny and around 45 degrees. The area is very active with wild life, deer, turkey, squirrels, and birds. I sit in the same spot on the ground every year. It is on the side of a ridge overlooking a creek. Everything got eerilly quiet no birds singing no squirrels playing and calling. I had just noticed how quiet it was when I heard 2 knocks to my right. Back up the creek I was over looking. While trying to figure out what I heard there came a response to my left very faint and far away. It freeked me out and I realized that I was sitting at a natural intersection. I didn't want to see what was making all the noise. So I left the area rather quickly.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness via phone and would like to add the following to his report. Witness and his family have hunted the WMA property for several years; however they had taken a year off in 2007 to give the deer population in the area a chance to recover from disease.  On this particular day, he had entered the woods on his 4-wheeler right around dawn and had been sitting for approx. 3 hours making deer calls when around 9:00am he noticed that everything became very quiet. The witness confirmed that he then heard 3 distinct knocks to the right and 30-45 seconds later he heard 2 faint knocks to his left.  At the time he had no idea as to what would have made the knocks but said he instantly began to feel uncomfortable and the hair stood up on his arms and neck.  He immediately packed his equipment and left.   He insists that in all his years of hunting and being in the outdoors, he has never had that feeling come over him before or since the day in 2008.Recently he and his wife were watching a TV program in which wood knocking was being discussed.  He realized that wood knocking sounded exactly like what he heard in the woods in 2008 and filed a report.The Cheatham Wildlife Management Area is over 20,000 acres and with a strong deer population, plenty of cover and fresh water is an excellent habitat.",
