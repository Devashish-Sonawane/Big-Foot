            "Observed": "13 Miles south of Glen Avon Bridge on the Molalla River in Oregon, my friend, myself and two large dogs jumped out of my truck to check up on a regular camp site we use throughout the summer. We walked only about 25 ft from the gravel road and a huge sound of bushes/trees crackling and breaking came from our left. I saw the disturbance out of the corner of my eye and when I looked over, I could see the brush moving violently about 10 ft beyond our path. I didn't see any thing but  there was an enormous two or three steps traveling away from us and I could feel the vibration of the weight of the steps under my own feet. That was no deer or elk, the pounding of steps was too heavy and there was a distinct - one step, then a broad second step hitting the ground.  I instantly knew that we had definitely startled something that was very big, very close and very fast.",

It is is about 1,200' in elevation and has the typical scruffy low-elevation forest look about it - some tall trees, mostly second growth, and a tangled understory of alder, slide alder, huge ferns and dense brush. The forest across the river has a much more established and older appearance to it. The abrupt start of the tree shaking was possibly connected with a resting sasquatch rousing from sleep and holding on to trees to beat a hasty retreat. The witness again mentioned the frequent detection of foul aromas and a definite feeling of \"being observed\" on many occasions. The witness was totally convinced that the steps heard could not be attributed to deer or elk.",
