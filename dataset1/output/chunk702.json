            "Observed": "It was dark, about 8pm. My two sons and I were watching television while eating popcorn. The eldest, age 16 was sitting accross the room, on the loveseat. The youngest, age 8 was sitting next to me on the sofa, we were sharing a bowl of popcorn placed between us. I smelled this horrific stench coming from the window directly behind us.(My family has teased me about having the nose of a hound)so the my 16 yr.old says \"Oh Mom your always smelling something.\" Well, I look around and the smell dissipates,we continue watching television; a few minutes pass, and the stench blows in again. I got up while telling my oldest son to help me pull out the sofa that there is something horrible under it.As he appooached he smells the stench and says\"It'ts a snake\", the youngest moved back, we pulled the couch out and looked all over the entire room and came up with nothing.We notice the breeze blowing the curtain and deside that whatever the source it's outside, and we'll check it out in daylight.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I talked to the mother and the son at great length about the 1981 incident and another incident that involved the son and a friend while they were coonhunting approximately \u0093six or seven years ago.\u0094Both witnesses recalled the night's events well. It was no doubt an experience of a lifetime for all three of the individuals involved. There were some details that were recalled by the son that the mother had not included in the report. The son recalled that after he first saw the \u0093prowler,\u0094 he remembered thinking that the individual had \u0093no clothes on.\u0094 Apparently, his grandparents (who lived just next door) had a security light on their property and it provided just enough illumination for the son to determine that the figure appeared unclothed. At that time, the son, 16 at the time, recalled thinking \u0093it was either some kind of wild man that had been in the woods a long time or some kind of nut.\u0094The son described what he saw in the window as \u0093hairy and wild,\u0094 with \u0093eyes not set so far back as an ape.\u0094 He further described the face as \u0093unique; not quite an ape, but not human.\u0094 The head was \u0093egg-shaped.\u0094 To the best of his recollection, the son remembered that its face was \u0093about three inches from the window.\u0094 He saw the creature through the window for probably two seconds at the most. It was at this point that he recalled thinking that the \u0093prowler\u0094 was not a prowler after all, but some sort of animal; he had heard all his life of two-legged, upright, hairy animals that lived in the mountains, but never gave them much thought until he saw what he saw in the window, and pursued the \u0093prowler\u0094 on foot.  The son stated that when he gave chase to the animal, he remembered that it was carrying a chicken by the legs in one hand. This encounter afforded him the best view yet, as the distance between him and the animal was perhaps only 25 yards. He estimated that the figure was easily 6 \u00bd - 7 feet tall and covered with coarse hair. With flashlight on the animal and automatic 12-gauge shotgun in hand, the son watched the strange animal in a dead run collide with the barbed wire fence. The creature ran right into the fence, apparently not seeing it. The collision caused the top strand of the fence to snap; the animal fell over the fence. It dropped the chicken and promptly regained its footing, only to sprint and hurdle a \u0093six-foot high brush pile\u0094 before scurrying up the hill and out of sight, all the while the chicken escaping. The son told the deputy who arrived on scene that he didn\u0092t care if anyone thought he was crazy, he saw \u0093whatever it was\u0094 clear the brush pile with ease. The son remembered the deputy finding hair on the fence and putting it in his pocket. The son said that the family didn\u0092t get any sleep that night, nor did they sleep much for the next several nights. When all was said and done, it was apparent that something had pilfered through the deep freeze. The family came to the conclusion that the visitor had managed to figure out how to open the door to the \u0093wash house,\u0094 and then knew to open and look inside the deep freeze that was contained in the \u0093wash house.\u0094 The son told me that in hindsight, he entertains the possibility that there were two of the creatures at the house that night.After that night, over the next four to five years, the family believed that the animal stayed in the area; the neighbors reported hearing weird screams and noises at night from time to time. Other occurrences such as missing chickens and missing pets also made the family feel uneasy. After no more than five years after the \u0093prowler\u0094 incident, everything seemed to return to normal; there were no more nocturnal vocalizations and no more missing chickens or missing meat from the deep freeze.  Another incident that involved the son happened while he and a friend were coonhunting in the mountains with five coondogs. The son and his friend saw an upright, bipedal animal at a distance of about thirty yards after the five coondogs began to \u0093whimper and whine\u0094 and generally behave \u0093in a most cowardly way.\u0094 During this encounter there was no smell detected. The animal was light-colored and was only about five feet tall. The son felt confident that \u0093it was a young one.\u0094 Its nose was flat. The son stated that the small one looked very similar to the one he saw in 1981 at his parents\u0092 house, but it was smaller and \u0093spindly,\u0094 or had a frail appearance. Seemingly, in order to escape the scrutiny of the coonhunters' lights, the creature escaped behind some small pines, never to be seen or detected again.The son stated that he is 38 years old and has spent his entire life in the woods from the time he was a baby. His point was that he has only had two encounters with these animals, yet he has spent countless days and hours upon hours hunting and basically living in the woods. He explained that \u0093it\u0092s no wonder they are so hard to locate and track; they can reason, and those woods and mountains are their home. That night that it went into our wash house and got into our freezer proved to me that they can reason.\u0094  ",
