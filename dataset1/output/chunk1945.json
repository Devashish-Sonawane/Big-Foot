I haved lived in the Texarkana area for quite some time. I don't coonhunt anymore my business has become more demanding. Coonhunting is a sport that really demands a lot of time. I found I didn't have the time to devote to it so I got rid of my Walker hounds. I was so into the sport at one time I had hunting Licenses in 3 states. I had several Night Champions to my credit.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness in his home on February 15, 2004. I consider the witness to be highly credible. As my wife and I discussed the incident with the witness, it became apparent that the witness had indeed experienced a life-altering event. The witness made it clear that he will never again return to the area and now is loath to even enter any forested area. The witness stated that he has never been as frightened as he was that night in the Sulphur River bottoms. Something of note that struck me about the incident was the splashing of the water by the creature as the witness and his dogs attempted to assess what they were seeing. Apparently, in an attempt to chase away the witness and his Walker coon dogs, the unknown animal splashed water with its hand toward them. The witness said he could clearly see its hand, which he described as looking like a \"huge monkey hand.\" The witness added that the skin was visible on the hand and that it was gray. The face was also a \"grayish color\" with no or very little hair on it. The hair on the head appeared \"slicked back\" and the animal in general appeared \"wet.\" The overall coloration was \"dark, rusty brown\" or a \"similar but a little darker than pine needles\" after they have fallen on the ground and turned color. The witness said he did see a \"flash of teeth\" and they appeared human but much larger. The witness apparently was haunted because the face, as he described it, was \"like that of a person.\" I found the reaction of the coon dogs of interest as well. Initially, before the witness established eye contact with the bigfoot, the dogs were \"nervous\" and \"whiney,\" and stayed behind the witness. Upon seeing the creature, the dogs became emboldened and it was all the witness could do to keep the dogs from breaking free from their leashes to attack the creature. The witness felt that the dogs may have saved his life, but I told him that based on reports that I've investigated and others that I've read or heard about, his dogs may have been killed had they been free to attack. After the interview, I drove to the general area of the sighting. It is ideal for the species, as is generally the entire Red River - Sulphur River corridor from Southwest Arkansas over to Grayson County, Texas. The majority of the reports that I have investigated have been in the Red River - Sulphur River corridor. I am confident that the animals live along these rivers and the family of creeks along these rivers. Much of the environment is heavily wooded, marshy, muddy, and downright inhospitable (to humans).    ",

After ten minutes or so of sitting on the spot waiting for deer or hogs I heard at aprox. 20 yards a real loud scream I mean loud. I became concerned since I was by myself and this is a private property far from any houses. I walked out of the woods and as soon as I made it to the right of way I heard something walking toward me and it sounded heavy breaking limbs as it came. I moved away from the edge of the woods, raised my 30/30 and got ready to confront whatever it was. This thing never came out but it was looking at me because I could hear the very heavy breathing just standing in the brush. It was already getting dark. I decided to get back to my truck parked about 1/4 of a mile down. Still holding the rifle, I got to the dirt road just on the other side of the right of way and walked as fast as I could to the truck. I did not run because I am a hunter and know the nature of wild things and dont want to be chased. As I walked toward the truck I could still hear this thing walking right along with me, but it would never come out. The dirt road makes a right and this is when I was scared the most because I could no longer hear or see that area. Anyway I made it to the truck (thank God) and got out of there as fast as I could. Like I said never saw what it was and never hunted in the spot again.",
