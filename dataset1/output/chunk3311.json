He said some Navajo word to me and when I said \"what?\" he said bigfoot but added that they usually drop from trees onto the backs of deer passing below breaking their spines or legs to immobilize them. I'm not great at the geography of that area but I figure the closest sighting posted on your site is the West Orange sighting by a woman out of her bathroom window.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I visited the area with the witness on Saturday December 9th. This person is in his early forties, married with two children, and holds a professional position in the pharmaceutical industry. I found him to be very credible.The sighting took place on route 607 southbound. This location of Livingston is fairly wooded with a mixture of hardwoods, conifers and some swamps. There are three reservoirs in the general area that are owned by the Commonwealth Water Company. Deer are plentiful here and were present at the time of the investigation.The witness told me that he could see what looked like 3 to 4 inch dark brown or black hair flowing from the lower head and shoulder region of the figure chasing the deer. Overall, the figure was dark brown to black. No facial features were made out due to the distance involved and the short duration of the sighting.Upon searching the swamp where the figure entered after crossing the road, a possible track was found, photographed and cast. The track measured 14 1/2 inches long by 6 inches wide and was sunk into the ground 2 inches deep. There is no way of knowing if the same being seen made this track, although the overall size of the track would suggest a larger individual. Also it was obviously not made at the time of the sighting. I estimate the track to be a week and half to two weeks old. There was not much detail as the constant freezing and thawing of the swampy earth caused the soil to crack, but the outline of a left foot could clearly be seen. The terrain of this area was very un-even and filled with clumps of grasses. It is my opinion that it would be very difficult if not impossible for a person to run this terrain without falling or breaking an ankle. Below are photos of the area and the track casting.The road in which the figure crossed left to right.The swamp where the figure entered in pursuit of the deer and where the track was found and cast.Side view of track casting.
