High whoops finishing in low guttural sounds at first.  Also some chirping and shrill, high-pitched whistling type sounds.Each series of loud calls was answered by a different set of calls further away.   The adult witness said \"There was a tone of conversation in some of the vocals.\"A few weeks later the pair again heard similar sounds just outside the boundary of their yard in the early evening hours.The family's normally brave dog would not leave the porch during these episodes.Tie in Report: Report #7441",

At that time all 5 of [name removed]'s chow dogs ran past me to go after whatever was their,I heard what sounded like the most awful dog fight ever in the woods along with what sound like a just a heavy roar and some shrieks along with some dog wimpering.

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness (\"J\") at length about his encounter. Prior to the direct observation that J and his friend (\"F\") had that night, several strange things occurred that seemed to indicate the potential presence of one or more sasquatches in the area. J and F had both heard loud and sustained vocalizations at night which were unlike any animal sounds that they were familiar with. They were quite familiar with typical night sounds (owls, coyotes, foxes, etc.), yet the sounds they were hearing in the nights prior to the encounter were unattributable to any known animal. J related to me that F's family owned five large chow dogs that had recently aggressively pursued something on the property; something that made loud and intimidating sounds as it fought off the dogs. A nearby chicken house was also losing chickens in an unusual manner. The chickens were being taken from the structure in a way that ruled out coyotes or stray dogs. As J and F walked toward the house that evening, the sound of heavy breathing drew both of their attention to the very large creature uphill from their position in the treeline. F saw the sasquatch first, and frantically told J to run. J stood frozen in place for a few seconds to observe the creature as it moved.J watched the sasquatch take one long stride down the embankment and stand in the middle of the dirt road. It stood only 30 to 35 feet from him. \"It was huge...\" J related. \"I am confident that it was at least eight feet tall, and weighed at least 600 pounds. It was incredibly wide; nearly as wide as the dirt road itself.\" When I asked him about the mass of the creature, he replied \"It looked very healthy, like it didn't miss many meals.\"J described the sasquatch as having a very broad chest, and a very large head. The moon was bright enough to see that the creature's hair was very dark. Its eyes reflected the ambient moonlight with a slightly green tint, which the witness described as similar to the reflectivity of a deer's eyes at night. At that distance, J was able to smell the sasquatch. He described the smell as a combination of musky animal scent with a strong pine scent as well. \"It almost smelled like a large wild animal with Pine Sol on it\" he said. Both J and F ran to F's house, alarming the 5 large chow dogs. The dogs took off in pursuit of the sasquatch. J and F listened as the dogs chased the large creature, and heard what seemed to be a frantic struggle between the dogs and the sasquatches. When the dogs finally returned, one of them was very noticeably injured. A second dog had quite a bit of blood in and around its mouth. J is confident that the blood belonged to the sasquatch, and not the dog. After that encounter, neither J nor F saw or heard any indication that the sasquatch returned to the property. The surrounding area has a somewhat notorious history of encounters. The general area has long been called \"Booger Hollow\", an early reference to presence of sasquatches. The nearby \"Booger Hollow Store\" also bares images of creatures resembling sasquatches on their signage.Having spent a great deal of time in the Northeast Georgia mountains conducting field research and gathering data from witnesses, I believe that J and F legitimately encountered a sasquatch that night.
