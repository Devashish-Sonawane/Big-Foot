            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the man on the phone six days after the encounter and then investigated the site.  The gentleman is a former Special Forces Army Officer and retired Florida Highway Patrolman. Google earth image of the location:On the morning of December 5, 2012, he went hog hunting on land adjacent to JW Corbett Wildlife Management called the Hungryland. It is a 16,000+ acre limited motor vehicle environmental area. He parked his truck around 3:30 am, intending to finish his coffee before heading out to his tree stand 1 \u00bd  miles from the dirt road. Photo of where his truck was parked:His windows were closed. After a few minutes he caught movement on his right peripheral. Photo of where the bigfoot came from:He thought at first someone was attempting to sneak up behind the truck, and he looked into the rear view mirror. The roof of his truck is 6 feet high and what he saw behind him was \u0093someone\u0094 taller than his truck and also seemed to be wider than the back 5 foot wide window. He described it as a \u0093massive\u0094 individual. It was dark and bipedal. Then, as the \u0093individual\u0094 crossed west to east, it made contact with his trailer hitch and shook the entire truck. Photo of the back of the SUV and hitch:He watched it disappear into woods next to the trail, with a quick stride.  The trailer hitch sticks out several inches; however it is unclear if the creature stepped on the hitch, used its hands or bumped into the hitch to cause the truck to shake. I stood on the hitch, and my weight barely moved the truck. The truck\u0092s windows are heavily tinted, it is possible that it did not see the man inside.The grunts he referred to may have been bull frogs.He knew that he had seen a bigfoot. And since it seemed to have walked away from him, he decided to stay and hunt. He waited until about 5:30 am until he got out of the vehicle. He went to the back of the truck and \u0093camo-ed\u0094 up.  He felt he was being watched, but thought if the sasquatch had meant to harm him it would have done so earlier in the night. His quote, \u0093It was so big that it could have torn my truck apart, but it didn\u0092t. So I didn\u0092t think it was out to hurt me.\u0094He walked to his stand in the breaking dawn. He said it was eerily quiet and just knew he was being followed to his stand. It wasn\u0092t until he was up in the stand for a while that he realized he had been rattled enough to forget his water and food.  He returned to his truck around 7:30 am to get his supplies, and it wasn\u0092t until he got back to the stand that the birds and animals began making their normal sounds. He didn\u0092t feel like he was with company any longer.He stayed out until about 3 \u0096 4 pm and never saw any animals to shoot.I found the gentleman extremely credible; he offered to take a polygraph test. Although I know bigfoots exist, he was very sincere in his endeavor to continuously attempt to convince me that \u0093these things really exist.\u0094   He realizes how fortunate he is to have experienced this, and now plans to spend his free time squatching here.The area is very desolate and heading west for the next 25 miles is nothing but woods and farm land. To the south and north is a greenway that extends approximately 50 miles in both directions. There are deer, hog, turkey, and rabbit. In the nearby canal there are frogs, fish, alligators, turtles and birds. There is an abundant food source.BFRO Report regarding a bigfoot possibly getting hit by a car that he is referring to: Report #1719Report #26271 is very close to this area.",
