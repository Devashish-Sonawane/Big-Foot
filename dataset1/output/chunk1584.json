            "Follow-Up Report": "I met the witness at his home. It is in a wooded and hilly area surrounded by mixed farmland and wooded areas, about 30 miles east of the Huron-Manistee National Forest. There is a small creek going through the backyard with swamps and a small lake nearby. About 2am the witness heard whoops on a wooded hill across the road from the house. He went out on the porch and heard something large moving on the hill going to his left (west). It stayed in the wood line till it reached a driveway 140 yards from the witness. It crossed the road and came back toward the witness to the tree line at the edge of the witness' property, where it crouched behind a tree with a stump next to it. When the animal was moving away from the witness, he got off the porch and crouched next to a tree about 15 yards from the tree line. While the animal was crouching behind the stump, the witness stood up and turned his flashlight on. The animal stood up and started walking to the witness' left (south) away from the road, toward the creek in their backyard, staying in the tree line. When the animal stood up the witness started backing up toward his porch.The witness only saw the animal in silhouette when it crossed the road. When he saw it with the flashlight at 15 yards he got a good look at its face and body from the waist up. He said it was about 7 feet tall and muscular with wide shoulders. It was dark brown or blackish and the hair was about four or five inches long, with the hair being longer toward the neck. The eyes were set wide and it had a flat nose with the face being covered with short hair. The arms reached past the waist.The witness lives with his grandparents, I spoke with all of them for over an hour. They all had stories about hearing whoops, yells and knocks. Once something hit the house and they all described it sounding like a truck had hit the house. The witness said there is year round activity, with August thru November being much more active than the rest of the year.",

            "Observed": "the first time i ever saw a sasquatch was in 1991. where i live is pretty rugged terrain so you would believe anything could be out there. i have figured out that if we do have sasquatch occasionally they do not live over hear because they are pretty much immpossible to find because ive been searching for years and one in a blue moon just when you think there is no possible way somthing could be out there you have somthing happen to make you think otherwise. well this is how my first sighting occured, it was about 2:00pm in the middle of April.  i was running through our garden with a bb gun just shooting around being a kid when i ran out of are garden i jumped up on this big rock that was on the top of this revine that lead down into this hollow which at the top of this mountain a small drainage ditch ran into it where i was at. well i jumped up on this rock and said \"Bang\"! well when i did i heard a branch break on the right of me and immediatly i turned and with in 13' of this creature that was about 5' tall whith this hair that resembled a rabbit in color but was long. it was standing kind of hunched over like a bodybuilder would do when showing his abs, it also had a pointed head but i don't remember seeing a face and im not going to make one up beacuse i don't want to tell a lie about somthing i didn't see. well it turned and ran through the woods away from me and i turned and ran away from it. as i ran i stopped to hear anything and i could still hear it running with lots of branches popping and cracking. as i continued to run i ran in the house to were my mom was and she said i was terrified so i grabbed my real shotgun and my mom and took her beacause i wanted her to see where it was at so we got back there and i found lots of big branches that had been broken and alot of slide marks for it was on a hillside. as i walked the little spilway that meets the revine i founf a very desernable footprint on the bank of it. it was about a size 6 shoe because that is what my moms shoe size is and we had it there for comparison and oddly enough it only had three toes. well this is really all i can tell you about this sighting i had but i will post my others soon. thanks for listening.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness by phone and found him to be credible. He viewed the animal for only five to ten seconds but at a distance of less than fifteen feet. The creature's face was flat, no muzzle and the body was covered with short brown hair. It looked like a human as it ran off through the woods. The witness emphasized that the three-toed tracks found nearby were not necessarily made by the same animal he had seen. ",
