            "Follow-Up Report": "On 5/23/2011 I spoke to the actual witness who had the encounter.  He now lives in Arizona.   He stated that while he was 15 in 1962, he and a group of friends and relatives were camping near twin lakes in Kalkaska county.   On the evening there were there, three or four large rocks, the size of grapefruits were thrown in their direction from the surrounding woods.   They landed ten to fifteen feet from them.   They at first blamed it on one of the other campers, then realized they were all accounted for.The next day the witness and his uncle were driving to the local party store and seen a large animal cross the road in front of them, approximately 100 yards away.   It crossed the road in two steps and was gone.   It was described as very large and reddish brown in color.   It walked on two legs the entire time and was very tall.  The witness said they seen it cross by a branch on a tree and was taller than the branch.  When they stopped at the location, the animal was gone and he described the branch as being at least seven to eight feet tall, with the animal being taller than that as it passed by.When they stopped at the party store, they told the man working at the party store, who stated it was probably a bigfoot and they have several stories told to them by other people around there.   They had no further incidents while camping there.  This area is in the Pere Marquette State Forest and has several small lakes, creeks, marshlands, and forest, both pine forest and hardwoods.   It provides many different food opportunities.   I found the witness to be very straight forward and honest in his recollection of events.",
