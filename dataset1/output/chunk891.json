I looked to my left to the lake area that is roped off for the runway. It was just starting to get dark between 8:30pm - 8:45pm \"I checked my watch after the incident.\" I felt the urge to put my cordless spotlite on and look to my right down the concrete runway giving it a quick glance my urge told me to look to the left into the trees, that is when I saw a pair of the biggest red eyes glowing back at me that I have ever seen. We watched each other for 2 minutes it then moved sideways and it was at this time I could see it's outline in the fading light. It was standing upright as it moved behind a tree, when it moved there was another pair of red glowing eyes but much smaller, I must rephrase and say shorter than the original outline.",
