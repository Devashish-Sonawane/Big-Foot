            "Follow-Up Report": "I had the opportunity to talk with a senior female Native American on the evening of August 20, 2008. We discussed her two encounters on consecutive nights, which took place starting on the 14th of August.  She has heard many stories about these creatures, but refused to really believe in them until a few nights ago. After her sighting, she was scared out of her mind and had a very difficult time trying to sleep after that. The conversations I had with her were very compelling, making her story credible and believable. This witness first heard what she thought were three consecutive growls/whistles, with a duration about 3 to 5 seconds each time, on the first night. She has two shelties and they were asleep the first night and didn\u0092t make any sounds. The whistle part of the growl was different than any she had ever heard before, but it made the hair stand up on the back of her neck. She was advised by a friend who pointed her to the BFRO website. She heard the exact same sound in our growl and whistle section. This witness was scared, but decided to make a call back sounding something like two cats that were fighting. She made that sound for me, and it sounded pretty good, plus it did sound like a couple of cats fighting.Anyway, she then heard what sounded like a large person walking away, making a bipedal sound walking through the leaves in her backyard and through her neighbor\u0092s yard.Second night, her two shelties started to growl at around 1 am, but this time she looked out the window, and what she saw was approximately 7 ft tall, a creature silhouetted from below the mid section on up that had hair protruding and/or sticking out all over its body, and one of its arms was visible to her. This creature was standing about 15 to 20 ft away from her location, in the moonlight, and she could see its shadow on the next door neighbor\u0092s trailer.Without even thinking, she made the fighting cat sounds again, because she didn\u0092t know what else to do, and she was so scared. Again this creature turned and walked away from her property and into the mountainous area behind her trailer moving very fast. This witness never mentioned anything about any type of a bad smell during this whole process.We, the wife and I, live about a hundred or so miles North from this location, and we have had to close our window shades at about the midnight hour, until the moon goes down, because of the brightness of that moon on those same nights. It was almost like daylight because you could see the shadows of the trees and of the buildings. I then ask the question, did you ever check for any tracks or anything else that this creature might have left behind? Her answer was \u0093Yes\", but she didn\u0092t see anything like that, but she figured out just what that creature was eating in her backyard.  She had grapes growing in her yard, and so she removed all that she could so this thing wouldn\u0092t come back. But, her neighbor still had an apricot tree in her yard with fruit still attached. Note on the third night her two dogs began to growl again, but this time the window was shut, and she just went to bed.",
