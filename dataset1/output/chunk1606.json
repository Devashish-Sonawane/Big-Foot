            "Follow-Up Report": "Witness was sincere and credible in his account. In the Winter of 2008, the witness, after an argument with his girlfriend, decided to leave her house and walk to his sister\u0092s house along the shoulder of W. Nifong Blvd., in Columbia, Missouri. Outside temps were low 40 degrees. Witness sensed an odd feeling that he was being watched and followed. He caught movement out of the corner of his eye. The witness wrestled with thoughts of denial that something was there but the movement and feelings persisted. Witness began walking as fast as he could but the unknown subject was gaining on him, yet taking fewer steps comparatively. The creature that followed the witness was located approximately 20-30 yards away on the other side of a tree row on the north side of the road. That section of road has a golf course and patches of trees and woods on both sides. The witness stopped and squarely faced the subject following him. He observed a bipedal creature at least 8ft tall, with a 3.5 ft. shoulder span, covered in dark colored hair and weighing in excess of 600 lbs. The creature was also described as having a cone shaped head and long arms with hands hanging past the waist. No ears were seen, but a mouth was distinguished and the eyes just barely. He described the face as part ape and part human but tending more toward human. As soon as he looked directly at it, the creature vocalized a low, deep and raspy growl. Witness interpreted growl as an intimidation attempt and communicating a \u0093don\u0092t look at me\u0094 message. Witness immediately diverted his gaze for fear of provoking it and began walking again. Creature continued to follow him. Witness was extremely frightened. He took out his cell phone and texted the word \u0093bigfoot\u0094 then later the phrase \u0093don\u0092t think I\u0092ll make it\u0094 to his girlfriend. Witness was under the impression that the creature would eventually catch up with him given its ease of speedy movement. Within another minute the creature was gone. The witness had heard of bigfoot previous to this sighting, thinking it may be possible but not fully believing because of his philosophy that he must see one to believe. Witness said at the time of his encounter he knew what he was looking at, that it was a bigfoot, and that he then knew they exist. Witness lived in Minnesota previous to relocating to Missouri. He has experience bear hunting and even had a pet bear cub for a week. He is familiar with all manner of wildlife and knows the creature he witnessed was no bear or other common animal.The location of the sighting, though what may be considered a semi-metropolitan area, consists of forested areas. The Missouri River is merely 5-6 miles away and is accessible via nearly continuous wooded tracts. Bigfoot sightings are less common but not unheard of in semi- metropolitan areas where there are woodland or riparian corridors providing ease of covered movement.",
