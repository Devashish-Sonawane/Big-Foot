            "Follow-Up Report": "I called the witness, and we talked for about one-half hour. As often happens there are additional details and clarifications that were not in the original report.I know the witness from several BFRO expeditions she has been on, including the Olympics Expedition of 2013. This witness is a veteran squatcher and very knowledgeable as to the behaviors and vocalizations of sasquatches, as well as the other common animals in the area. She has learned to pay attention to the sounds in the forest. She also had another encounter in this general area in July 2008.This event occurred over two nights: September 14 and 15, 2014, ending at daylight on September 16th.The witness, her son, daughter, and grandson drove to the end of the road where there is both a trail-head and a campground. They hiked in to the Twin Sisters Lakes, which is several miles. The witness and her son were planning to spend the next two nights, and her daughter and grandson were planning on only spending the day and then hike back.After her daughter and grandson left, the witness tried a couple of wood-knocks with no response. The night of the 14th was uneventful.The next evening at dusk they did a whoop. This whoop was answered by a return whoop from the south side of the lake, a distance of .4 miles. They were camping on the north side of the lake. This whoop was followed by a wood-knock from the north of their camp a little later. The elk were in rut, and several of them were also bugling in response to the whoops. After they went to their tents to go to sleep, the witness stayed awake listening. Her son was soon asleep, snoring. It should be noted that snoring seems to be the \u0093all clear\u0094 signal if a sasquatch is going to approach or enter an occupied camp-site. Soon after the son was snoring, she could feel and hear the foot-falls on a large creature entering camp. It was stepping right on the edge of her tent, and not wanting to be stepped-on, silently pulled her arm towards her body. She said that the creature almost stepped on her arm. Also of significance, her head was physically touched through the tent. She felt her head being pushed-down with its hand. She was laying on her back up against the side of the tent, as her dog was on the left side. It touched her forehead. The tents were quite small, single-person backpacking tents, approximately three feet wide. There was not much room.Let me comment on the witness being unable to speak. This happens very often. Very often this is accompanied by the feeling of being unable to move, or the feeling of a heavy weight being pushed down on them. These feelings leave when the interaction is over and the creature has left. We are not sure as to the exact cause, whether it comes from within or is externally influenced.She did not sleep at all that night. The creature stayed in or around the camp all night and she lay awake listening. In the morning, as it started to get light, the creature left. They hurriedly packed-up camp to leave. As they were departing, about 4:30 AM, they heard a wood-knock from the north.It should be noted that in this area of the central Cascade Mountains, we have had incidents of BFRO investigators being physically touched through their tents. I know of three occurrences where their heads were touched. Several other times, people\u0092s legs were grabbed gently and then released. This is a fairly common occurrence here. Sasquatch vocalizations are common, and recorded often. I know of several occasions where BFRO investigators, as well as expedition attendees, have witnessed sasquatches visually, through night-vision scopes, and thermal imagers. They definitely reside in this area of the Cascades during the summer and fall. The area gets snowed-in about the end of October, and there is snow until June.",

Somewhere between 30 - 50 yards and it was on an elevated plane to us. Just outside of Helen off of s.r.75 north of the Upper Chattahoochee River Recreation Area. If you go to the top of the mountain north of the park clearing thats where my experience was. I had my first experience there in the year 1990. While a group of 5 friends and I were walking late at night we saw something on a near by ridge it stood up clearly visible but only as a sillouette in the moon light and jumped a very large distance. It then seem to stride over the back side of the ridge away from us. It was actually very quiet it didnt make a sound before we saw it stand and we didnt hear it land or stride away, as if it was stalking or observing us! Of course we were all extremely scared after seeing it initially. Again it was at night, and far away so we couldnt get a clear description. But we all saw it and were all struck with a panic like fear!",
