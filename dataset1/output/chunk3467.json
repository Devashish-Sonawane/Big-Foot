I lived in an apartment complex that backed up to the woods.  I was eleven  years old at the time but remember it like yesterday.  I was just after dark and I was taking the garbage out to the dumpster.  Two friends of mine came running from behind the building in a panic.  I ask what was wrong and they said they had seen a huge whitesh covered creature at the edge of the woods.  These kids were a year or two younger then me.  Me being the older decided to get my fathers 12 volt spotlight and take a look.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with the witness on 1/7/2006 for about an hour. I found the witness to be very credible. He is now in his forties and resides in another state. He recounted the sighting in detail. He had the following comments to add;The eyes glowed red when hit with the light beam of the flash light.He did not stay in the area long enough to make out any facial details. He had the following points to make in reference to the silhouette.There was no neck. He said it looked like the head was directly connected to the shoulders.The shoulders where very wide. Much wider then a person and it had an overall large build.The height was around seven feet. The witness was able to judge this by visiting the exact location the next day. He compared the eye height of the silhouette to a branch six feet above the ground, which the figure was standing behind at the time of the sighting. The eye height was well above this branch. He did not recall finding any noticeable tracks at the location.He said he had heard strange screams on occasion, while hunting muskrat along the Delaware River. He also added that he and his friends where frightened out of the woods by occasional sounds of heavy breathing.The overall area which the encounter took place is mixed woods, a cornfield which backed into a swamp and the Supawna Meadows National Wildlife Refuge.
