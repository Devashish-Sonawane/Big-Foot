            "Observed": "I was deer hunting not to far from Angola Bay Game Land in Duplin County NC I was walking through the woods by the Northeast Cape Fear River and observed a red tinted figure approximately 8 to 9 ft tall it looked like it was taking a drink of water I was so frozen by what I was seeing I couldn't move from the shock. It took a drink and looked up and I believed it seen me got and got up and just walked off in the distance over a hill and it was gone. Needless to say I ran hard for at least 2 miles and haven't been back since then.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone.  The witness is a law enforcement officer with several years experience.In mid November of 2011 the witness went hunting for whitetail deer along the banks of the Northeast Cape Fear River. Armed with a .30-06 rifle he decided that he would walk along the swamp land along the river bank in an attempt to \"drive\" deer out. While walking through the brush along the bank he began to notice a musky odor that he described as a stagnant water smell and began to feel nervous that a black bear was close by. When the witness looked across the opposite side of the river bank he observed what he first thought was a bear squatting down.  He stated that the animal looked as if it was scooping something out of the water. As if it was trying to catch something or trying to drink water.  At this time he believed the animal noticed his presence and stood up in a motion that he described as a \"marine snapping up very rapidly\" and let out a very deep, guttural grunt.  The witness froze with fear as he realized that this was not a bear and he watched the animal walk bipedally very quickly and fluidly off into the brush.  It was at this point that the witness quickly made his way back a few miles or so to his truck and refuses to go back to the location. Due to lighting conditions and distance from the animal the witness was unable to make out any distinct facial features, but he described the animal as at least 8 foot tall and around 400 lbs.  It appeared to be very muscular with broad shoulders and long arms.  The fur was reddish-brown and coarse.  He was very adamant that what he saw was not a bear and that it looked like a \"large man covered in hair.\"I found the witness to be sincere and credible. As a law enforcement officer he is a trained observer. The witness has lived close to the area for many years and is very familiar with local wildlife.The location of this incident is very close to the Angola Bay Game Lands that encompasses over 24,000 acres of Duplin and Pender counties.  The area has a large population of whitetail deer, wild turkey, black bear, and feral hogs.  The location is also surrounded by large tracks of agricultural lands. There is also a history of sightings in Duplin County and the surrounding Sampson, Pender, and Onslow Counties.",

Nothing was there, and there was no noise of something running away. The woods are thick there so, someone or something would only have to stand a few feet away to disappear.

            "Follow-Up Report": "The witnesses live on a small farm in a very remote area outside Deland, FL, between the Ocala National Forest and the Seminole State Forest. Both areas have a high concentration of Sasquatch reports and have heavy areas of first growth forest. The area of the farm is all first growth pine and oak forest with scrub. The witnesses are very sincere and credible; one is active duty military, the other a nursing home administrator. Many other things have happened since they first reported activity. I will cover all the activity in this report. On July 4, they had a BBQ with five adults, and a four year old child. The entire day had been spent outside cooking and playing. After 9 PM they lit fireworks. The daughter\u0092s boyfriend is an Officer in the Marine Corps. He is also a sniper. During the fireworks, he noticed movement and a dark shape about 15 -20 feet away from them. He yelled, \u0093I think there\u0092s a bear.\u0094 Before everyone could look towards it, they all heard a very low, deep growl. Once they all looked, they heard it move away from them. The men got flashlights and attempted to follow the sound, but found nothing. The area the growl came from is near a path that leads to a lake on their property. From this pathway, their entire BBQ could have been watched.  A bear would have run once the fireworks started, and bears do not growl. Black bears can \u0093roar,\u0094 huff and snap their teeth, but cannot growl. Photo of the view the growler would have had watching the fireworks:About a month after that, the woman went on her back porch at night to get a drink from her outdoor refrigerator. She surprised something very large that growled in the same way as before but much louder. She describes it as very guttural. She heard something run away, and slap the side of the shed very loudly. She said it hit so hard, she joked to her husband that it must have knocked itself out. They retrieved flashlights, and again found nothing.A few weeks after that, her daughter went out to feed the chickens at night, and again the shed was slapped loudly.  She heard heavy footsteps move into the woods rapidly. It should be noted, that when these encounters occurred, the family\u0092s activities were not the normal routine. As it is a working \u0093farm\",  most days are routine with daily timely activities. It seems that when the routine changed, the activity of the family was reacted to. Around the same time, the couple returned home to find a 150 lb. metal barrel removed from the outbuilding it had been in. The barrel had been behind other barrels. The left back barrel in this photo was the one that was lifted out and pillaged:In order to remove this particular barrel, it would have had to be lifted up and over the others. The barrel has a pressure lock on it that I found difficult to remove. Photo of the barrel spring lock:The barrel was found about 60 feet outside the building in the woods. It was evident it had been carried \u0096 there was not a trace of it being rolled or dragged. The barrel had been opened and the dog food and chicken feed inside had been pillaged. It took two grown men to carry it back and return it to its proper place.Several times last summer, it seemed the chickens didn\u0092t produce as many eggs as usual. I asked if she would hear the chickens if something were in the hen house. She explained how the eggs roll to the back of the house where they are collected, so nothing goes in the hen house. Photo of the chicken coop egg hatch:The hinge door has a clip on it. She says it is unusual when the chickens are off by 10 or more eggs. It would seem eggs are taken on occasion.  (see photo.) They have many chickens and admit that if one went missing, it would go unnoticed. Photo of the chicken coop egg hatch latch:One night in February, a very swift, heavy bipedal sounding sprinter ran from the back of the property, alongside the house to the front woods. The runner was so quick; it didn\u0092t activate the sensor lights. The steps so heavy, the house shook.Last summer her beehive was \u0093decimated\u0094 from a bear. They put up an electric fence with three rows of barb wire on top. In May of 2012, the hive was raided again. This time, only the brood (larva) was eaten, not the honeycomb. The hive is made up of \u0093stacked\u0094 boxes, with frames of vertical honeycomb frames. The top box of honeycomb literally dripping with honey was removed and placed neatly on the ground and ignored. The bottom box filled with the larvae was eaten.  It was not destroyed as it had been before. Black hair was left on the barb wire and is being sent to a lab. (This report will be updated with results.)  Beehive section was placed neatly on the ground with the honey not being touched. Just the larva (brood) was eaten:Four 16 inch footprints with a 52 inch stride were discovered outside the hive fence.  16 inch left foot print (1), with 52 inch stride. Track of four prints found near beehive:16 inch right foot print (2):16 inch left foot print (3):16 inch right foot print (4):The family dogs bark when a bear is on the property. The couple claim that they usually know when a bear is nearby because of the dogs. The dogs did not bark during these incidents. At one time they did bark, but it was only after the woman yelled for the man. The behavior of dogs not barking at a Sasquatch has been reported in similar encounters. An X shaped stick structure was found very near where the barrel had been discarded. The branches had been broken and woven in to the surrounding trees to form the X. Photo of the x shaped stick structure where the stolen barrel was found:The property has a lake on it, and there are several other springs nearby. There are deer, turkey and edible trees in the area. Surrounding farms raise goats, pigs, chickens and cows. Every neighbor seems to have stories that are attributed to bear activity although I think that some of the incidents are not necessarily bear.  As stated earlier, this area has a history of Sasquatch reports. ",
