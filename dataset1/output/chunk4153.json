            "Media Issue": " Rich Grumley, president of CBO, says that several reports have come from people who were picnicking or swimming at some of the Valley's reservoirs and lakes.  Grumley states that investigation of those area's proved that bigfoot did, in fact, stop off, perhaps to escape the 100 degree temperatures momentarily, or to quench his giant thirst.  CBO vice president Floyd Smith has found large impressions of big feet near the shoreline at one location.  He believes that bigfoot made the tracks.  Lacy says that one eyewitness account described the creature as being \"not quite knee deep\" in a pool of water, which was found to be over four feet in depth.  And sometime latter a big hairy and apelike creature was seen swimming some distance away from shore.",

One nineteen year old motorcyclist reported to CBO members that he had stopped to rest when he espied the creature holding a good sized boulder in its hands, or paws, as if it were preparing to throw a two-handed shot put.  He threw it, narrowly missing the youth. CBO says that not all sightings investigated by us are for real.   Many Joshua trees have appeared to be bigfoot creatures.  Lacy, a CBO member, tells of monitoring a citizen band radio for one half hour one night and picked up criticisms cloaked in \"vague generalities, insults and derogatory remarks spoken by a few of the local CB'ers and directed toward the Bigfoot Organization.\"",
