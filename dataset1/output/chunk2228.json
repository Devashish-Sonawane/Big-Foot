It appeared that it was getting ready to leap off the side of the road.The witness watched the local newspapers and was surprised that it wasn't reported.  He was certain of what he saw and he assumed the people in the car ahead of him would have made some type of report as well. ",

I had no idea anyone else in my area had ever seen or reported any stories of a big foot. I never told anyone about what I and my friend seen hunting after school one day. I don't remember me and him even talking about it very much. It was in 1987 it was hunting season I'm not sure the month. The two of us were walking along a dirt road in the Lockerplant river bottoms. Not sure which of us seen it first but definitely caught our attention.We were looking down a right of way when this large figure walked out of the trees. It walked along the tree line for several seconds going back into trees. At first we thought it was one hell of a big man or maybe someone hauling a deer across there shoulders. I remember asking [my friend] if that guy was wearing a fur coat. We knew what it was and it was not a man. The thing was at least 7 foot tall and covered in hair. It seemed to walk like a person, it was too far away to notice any details about face, hands or feet. I'm not sure but think it noticed us and that was the reason it never crossed the right of way. We knew what we seen and even with guns in our hands we both ran all the way home.",
