            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to the witness about his experience and found him to be very credible.The witness told me that he was building a shelter or \"shack\" on the property to be used while hunting.  He was there alone, with the exception of his dog, a German Shepherd. At approximately 2000 hours, while momentarily halting his building activity to take a short break, the witness stepped out onto the deck on the front of the shack.  The witness stated that as soon as he lit a cigarette, a \u0093scream came off the side of the mountain\u0094 300 - 400 yards from the shelter.  It was a \u0093high-pitched scream kind of like a woman but with a low rumble.\u0094  The witness further described the sound as \u0093multi-tonal\u0094 and sounding like \u0093a bear, mountain lion, turkeys and a woman at the same time.\u0094Immediately the witness experienced an involuntary response.  The witness stated that he had had \u0093two tours in \u0091Nam\u0094 and while he had been scared before this was the first time that his \u0093hairs stood up.\u0094  The witness also disclosed that he is very familiar with sounds of all known, indigenous animals.  Animals such as tigers and howler monkeys were also mentioned by the witness as having sounds with which he was well familiar.  The first thought that entered into his mind upon hearing the eerie and loud vocalization was, \u0093I don\u0092t have a gun!\u0094  Instinct took over, and the witness said he immediately moved toward his truck to totally flee the area.  As he neared the truck, he noticed that it \u0093was shaking.\u0094  The witness stopped immediately, went back into the shack and \u0093grabbed a hatchet.\u0094  Cautiously, the witness went back to his still shaking truck, and peered into the bed of the truck to find his German Shepherd (about whom he had forgotten).  The dog was tightly curled into a ball, shaking to the point that the truck was visibly shaking as a direct result of the dog\u0092s trembling.  The witness said that it was evident that his dog was \u0093scared to death.\u0094  The witness without delay got into his truck and exited from the property. The witness told several of his friends and was immediately greeted with derision.  A few weeks later, the witness was back out at the shack working again.  This time, however, he was heavily armed and he had the place extremely well lit.  One of the friends that had mocked the witness arrived and further ridiculed him upon seeing the firepower within arm\u0092s reach.  That is, until the same type scream echoed into the night again at approximately the same time as before.  This time, the witness grabbed one of his weapons and began shining light out into the darkness attempting to ascertain what had caused the noise.  His friend who had been so scornful now stood back to back with the witness, and was constantly, loudly and vocally broadcasting expletives into the night.  The witness stated that while he was attempting to calm his friend for the next two hours, he also tried to determine what had made the sound, but to no avail.  Eventually the two left the property, still shaken from their experience.  The witness also told me of another of the landowners who had an anomalous experience while on the land burning piles of wood.  Apparently the individual heard a rather large, bipedal-sounding creature in the nearby woods.  The sounds emanating from the footsteps of the undetermined animal seemed to indicate that it was circling or stalking the man.  Upon smelling a very strong, rancid odor, the individual left hastily.  According to the witness, the individual left the wood piles burning - a decidedly uncharacteristic action on his part.In summation, the witness made it clear that whatever made those immensely loud, terrifying screams was an animal not of the norm.  Not only did the witness react in a terror-stricken manner, but so did his dog, a German Shepherd not easily bothered.  Further, his friend who initially scorned him, was overcome with the same visceral, self-preservational instinct - flee to safety.  It is impossible for me to say with absolute certainty that a bigfoot was responsible for terrifying this veteran of the Vietnam Conflict, but I don't think that a documented, indigenous animal is capable of propagating sounds that would elicit such responses from the witnesses or that remotely match the descriptions given.

We recreated the scene, Jeff modeling the movements of the animal and the witness and I driving toward the location at the same speed he was traveling at the time of the sighting. The recreation of the event revealed the following:        1. The animal was 2-3 feet taller than Jeff's (5'10\").        2. The animal's stride was nearly twice the length of Jeff's.        3. The grey/dirty white color was the color and not light            reflection and shadows. The dirt in the area is grey volcanic ash and could account for the color of this animal.        4. The animal's arms hung much lower than Jeff's.        5. The animal covered ground much quicker than Jeff.",
