            "Follow-Up Report": "On the evening of January 22, 2005, SY called me and we went over his second visual encounter. Which occurred in close proximity to his short road encounter that took place in April of 2003.  Note: his previous encounter is in report # 10265, same county. SY first thought that this might be a fisherman crouched on a rocky streambed, and he thought that he would just amble on over and ask him a few questions about how to fish this area. As he got a little closer, he noticed it was mostly just one color, and he then thought it might be a bear. Then it stood up, and looked at him, and that\u0092s when it hit him that this is the same kind of animal that had walked in front of his vehicle in April.  This sighting made him a little sick to his stomach, froze him in his tracks, and this time, it really shook him up.  They sized each other up, for what seemed like a very long time, but it was only a few seconds. The animal then turned its head to look downstream, SY thought it might have been a boat coming down stream, and it made a fifty-yard dash into the wooded area along the river and out of sight. Per SY, it took less than three seconds to make that move.The witness said that this creature was very large, seven feet or so with dark reddish brown hair all over its body, and had to weigh over four hundred pounds.  He couldn\u0092t give specific characteristics of the face due to the distance.  SY noticed that the legs had large quads, and were short for its height, but the torso seem much longer than a person, who might have been that tall.  The arms seemed longer than a person, and much more muscular. He couldn\u0092t tell if it was male or female, but he didn\u0092t see any breasts on its chest.  What SY wanted to convey to everyone is the speed that this creature can move, which is about twice as fast as our best athletes. When the creature reached the woods, SY dropped his fishing pole and took off towards his vehicle, and then took off for home.  Note: SY and his friend came back to the same location in July of 2003, and they retrieved his fishing pole, which was where he had dropped it in May.Summary: SY told me a very credible story, and I believe he had seen his second sasquatch. What I do find hard to believe is that SY saw a creature twice, and to me that is like wining the lotto twice. He doesn\u0092t quite see it that way, because he is still very troubled by these sightings. The witness is now out to prove these creatures are really out there, and has purchased some good equipment to do so.  He is going back up there this spring, and he really would like to talk with someone who has seen one of these animals. On this outing, SY still didn\u0092t have a camera in his possession, and he didn\u0092t check the area for footprints, because he was really too shook up to look this time. After talking to SY on two different occasions, I too will be planning a trip to this Redwood State Park soon.  Please notice the time of year, and the weather conditions when the sightings occurred.  If you have seen one of these creatures, and want to talk with SY, just write to the BFRO comment section, and I will pass on your e-mail address, so he can make contact with you.",
