They are considered to be some of the steepest and most rugged mountains in Northern Utah.After interviewing the witness the following can be added. He was familiar with the area and had hunted and scouted there before.  He has been hunting since he was fourteen years old.  It was a clear afternoon and he observed the animal for thirty seconds.  He could clearly see definition in the animals biceps, triceps and abdominals. It was very muscular, clearly athletic and bulldozed its way uphill through ten foot tall oak brush with its arm covering its face for protection.  The action looked liked a massive football player plowing through the line.  The witness doubted he could have even walked through the thick scrub oak let alone run through it.  This witness is believable.  ",
