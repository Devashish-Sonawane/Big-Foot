            "Follow-Up Report": "     I spoke with this witness for close to an hour on the phone.  Most follow-ups on a Class B encounter do not take this long, and most I do not post because there is too much chance for misidentification.  I'm posting this because the witness holds a high degree of credibility for me, and is not a stranger to the woods.  She has hunted in the past, and is very definite when she says it was not a buck snort.  Also, the behavior of the animal, in moving back and forth in the woods just out of sight and vocalizing in ways that she felt were directed at her, would not be typical behavior for other known critters.  She listened to the Ohio howl on our website, but what she heard was not like that.  As she tried to describe it, it was clear it was a vocalization of a type I have heard recently on an overnight here in Michigan when we also had vocalizations of the Ohio type, one sighting, and one rock throwing incident.  Plus, her friends have stories of their own, and when they come back from Florida we have plans to meet at their cabin for additional follow-up.  For these reasons, I'm posting this report.",
