This tells me that the creature was most likely stocky, solid, thick.- The hair was black or dark brown.- As it walked back into the woods it put its arms up.- The witness was unable to see the face of the animal.- The witness was also unable to guess an approximate weight of the animal.The area does have a population so I reviewed a satellite map (see below). There is a large wooded area adjoining  the area of the sighting location (circled in red). Part of Canton Lake is also visible near the top right of the photo. We have several reports from this county in our database. ",

As we were waiting, he called his grandmother -- because of the call time on his phone, we know what time this all occurred. While he was talking to her, his low fuel light came on, and they wrapped up the call at 7:45.",
