(rd. my mother lives off of) an elderly man and woman lived in a small house off the same drive. I don't think I was living with my mother at the time of this alleged incident but as I recall, it wasn't too long after our sighting. My husband and I went for a visit to my mother's home and my mother told me the man down the road was just beginning to head down County Line Rd. going back toward the way we were coming when we had our sighting. The story was, he was just starting to pick up speed and he was alone in his truck during the day when he had to slow down because he noticed \"something crouthced down in the road\".  He had to eventually come to a complete stop when the animal turned to look at him and proceeded to run off down the ditch and into the woods. The description of it was that it had hair all over it's body, it had a puggish nose and the chest was more bare. They said he was saying it probably stood about seven feet tall........\tI would like to know if there are other people in this are who have had similar sightings. We have had a lot of strange happenings in this area even other than just these sorts of sightings. Is that usual?  I know of other's in the surrounding area....... Kinglsey, Fife Lake, Boardman Valley, etc.. who have seen strange unexplainable things but most of the people I know of aren't the types that might report what they are seeing. meaning quiet, nice people that don't want to stir things up in any way. I once asked a gas station attendant in the Kingsley area about it not long after the sighting and he laughed and said \"that's nothing new\"..........Please let me know if there are more people in this area who have had simmilar experiences. It would just be nice to know.",

It was probably around two or three A.M. when we finally hit County Line Rd. outside of where my mother lives. We were both staying with her at the time of the sighting. My mother lives in Buckley, about six miles down County Line Rd, once you turn off the main highway (can't recall the name of the highway at the moment.) We were about a half a mile or so down County Line Rd when we were talking, making jokes. We were both very tired.",
