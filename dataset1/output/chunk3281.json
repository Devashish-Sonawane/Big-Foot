            "Observed": "I was driving down the road and needed to use the restroom.  I stopped my vehicle and turned my lights and the motor off so I could hear if any other vehicles were coming.  I smelled a very strong odor coming from the road in front of me.  It smelled a lot like a wild hog.  I turned the headlights on and standing approximately 30 yards in front of me was a large hairy creature 7 to 8 feet tall.  It had large eyes and a large mouth and it's hair was very long and shaggy and very dirty.  It had it's arms out to it's side like it was surprised that I turned the lights on.  It's arms were very long, longer than that of a human.  It stood there for a few minutes and then took two long strides into the woods.  I did not look for tracks that night, but came back the next day and did not see any, but the gravel road is very hard and there was pine straw on both sides of the road in the woods.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke to Mr. B over the phone and have these details to add.-In the summer of 2003, between 10pm and midnight, Mr. B stated that he pulled his car over onto the side of a rural road and turned the car off to relieve himself. While attending to his business in almost complete darkness he smelled what he described as an overwhelming odor like that of a \u0091hog pen\u0092. Curious, Mr. B reached into his car and turned on the headlights to his vehicle. Right away Mr. B saw a 7\u0092-8\u0092 tall creature with 3\u0094-4\u0094 inch muddy and matted hair looking back at him from 30 yards away, standing in the middle of the road directly in his headlights. -Mr. B stated that the muddy brown haired creature had red tints to its hair and that it was un-kept looking and was coated with mud on its legs and lower torso. He commented that it looked like the creature was wearing a Ghillie suit. It also had mud on its upper torso but not as much as on the lower parts of its body. Mr. B related that the right hand area he was parked near consisted of muddy tracts of land where loggers pulled trees onto the road. -Once Mr. B turned on his headlights the creature, walking from the right side of the road to the left, paused to stare at him. Mr. B gave me a description of what the creature looked like. It had wide and sloping, or \u0091slouched\u0092 shoulders, its arms hung down to its mid calf. Although the creature was holding its arms out when he first spotted it, the creature lowered its arms and Mr. B could not get a good look at its hands. Mr. B didn\u0092t see any teeth but commented that its mouth, or jaw, did not protrude, but that the mouth was 'large'. Mr. B stated that its nose was short and that its nostrils were \u0091big\u0092 and flared. He described the head as being shaped like an \u0091ape\u0092s head\u0092 but more rounded off. And that its eyes did not glow, but looked large and dark.-After looking at each other in silence for approximately one minute the creature resumed its walk towards the left side of the road and disappeared into the adjacent woods. Mr. B describes its gait as being similar to a man except that its stride was longer. Its posture remained upright during the entire episode.-Mr. B was adamant that he never felt threatened by the creature, even though it was only 30 yards away from him. He also made comment that the area is very rural and that it was only a mile or so from the Saline River.-As stated in the report, Mr. B did go to the sight the next day to look for tracks. But it had rained several times since his sighting and he could not find anything usable.-I found Mr. B to be articulate, truthful and matter of fact.-In doing a Google search from the area and questioning Mr. B, this area is very remote from any nearby houses. The area consists mainly of forests either freshly cut, re-planted or old growth that is used by the logging industry.",
