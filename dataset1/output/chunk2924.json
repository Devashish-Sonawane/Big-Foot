            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on the phone the evening of 10/07/08 then met with him and his wife at their residence the evening of 10/9/08.The sound was heard from the southeast just beyond a residential area and over the next ridge approximately 1 1/2 to 2 miles away.  From their house I could see over the residences to the next ridge and the distant national forest mountains.  This area beyond the ridge and in the national forest is known as the burn zone which burned several years ago and is now underbrush and various vegetation.  It is also a popular deer hunting area.  I have hiked around in this area and found a lot of deer sign.We discussed the type of sound. There may have been more but they clearly heard two distant vocalizations through the open window.  Doing his own investigation, the witness listened to sound clips on our website and felt the 1994 Ohio - Moaning Howl was a near perfect match to the type of sound and the duration of the calls.",
