            "Follow-Up Report": "After a day-long on-site investigation we came to a conclusion. The wood on wood sounds were coming from at least two different locations on the hills surrounding their cabins. Out of the ten people that were sleeping, seven of them were awakened by the loud knocking sounds. After about five minutes, the sounds stopped, but the smell still lingered in the air. Knowing the history of this property for (there has been two sightings) sometime now, I'm highly confident that their hollow is a main travel route into the Tappan Lake region for a family of bigfoots. A surveillance camera has been set up on the property and will be left up for thirty days. The property owners are usually at the property ten days a month. This was the first bigfoot related incident for over a year. They've owned the property for over 25 years.We had the opportunity to talk to some of the neighbors who concurred with the property owners that these creatures have been in the area for over 20 years. I'm hoping that some of them will come forward and submit a report to the BFRO for further investigation.Here is a picture of the area where we believe the creatures come through their property. Believe it or not, there's a spring fed creek beneath all that thick undergrowth. A surveillance camera has been set up near this location.",
