            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed the witness, and can add the following details to her report:The witness was the passenger, and her husband was driving west bound on Highway 91 going to Mesquite, Nevada. They first saw the creature as it approached the road from the left, coming up out of the river bottoms. They clearly saw the animal the entire time that it was exposed in their headlights. It was approximately four car lengths away. The animal walked across the road and crossed onto the dirt shoulder. The witnesses lost sight of the animal when they drove past it. They were one car length away when it was on the right hand shoulder. The witness stated that it couldn't have been a person in a suit because it was too massive, and looked too much like an animal. The animal had hair approximately twelve inches long, brown, and blowing in the wind. It looked at the vehicle several times, as if to determine if it was going to be hit. The river bottom in the area has cottonwoods, and the nearby hills are covered in cedars and pines. Based on the close proximity of the encounter, the sincerity of the witness, and the consistencies of the animal's behavior with other purported sasquatch behaviors, I believe that this is a legitmate Class A observation.
