Every year after fishing, I try to take a trip up river with a friend or two to wind down and enjoy ourselves before we go home. This year while I was on this trip into Alaska's interior our main mission was to take pictures of bears and the surrounding wildlife to promote a new bear viewing and sports fishing buisness. While on our five day trip, we spotted more than fourty bears. I took hundrends of pictures of these bears and their tracks.",

The footprints were found in an area that is frequented by a very large population of bears.  As such he is very knowledgeable about bear prints. The footprints measured nineteen inches long and eight inches wide. They were able to follow the footprints for a distance of about a hundred feet. The distance between each step was much greater than a man's. The witness did provide me with a series of photographs taken of the footprints but they were not of sufficient detail to be included with this report.  ",

            "Also Noticed": "I used to look across a valley and ridge at Meadow Lake and saw a lush little plateau on the opposing ridge and thought if I was a BF and I was in these parts this would be a good spot to be because of the lush vegetation [looked like a spring close] and the view to see if anyone was coming. I never even thought that there was a chance they would have been in these parts of the sierra. Call it a gut feeling but I get them right quite often, I sat quietly on my side of the ridge once and watched a coyote in the valley below me.  He came up the hill to within 3 feet of me and stopped.  I stood and went \"aaahhh\", I've never seen one run so fast lol.  [Sorry I know gut feelings don't count, but this spot is so remote I doubt anyone has ever been there.",

            "Observed": "While walking cross-country, looking for possible home sites from the early 19th and late 18 hundreds, I was walking the base of a small ridge between two lakes Lower Blue and Twin Lake. On the ridge side it was mostly open forest on the Twin Lake side the brush got thicker. As I was walking I heard a loud two tone whistle [low to high pitch] that was not a bird or any animal I know. The sound came from ground level and behind me to my left. The whistle was loud and sounded in my opinion from a mammal. I turned and called out thinking a hunter [in a place he should not have been][no hunting zone] but no one answered, I whistled back but nothing called. Wondering what it was, I investigated the area 'till i could get no farther, the brush was too thick. I was standing within 10 feet from where the whistle came from, nothing in sight not in the trees on the ground not anywhere, no bird's where flying and no animals in sight either. It was a little spooky but at the time i was cross-country running almost 5 miles a day at 8000 feet as well as boxing training and being a good bow hunter nothing scared me at that time. I was 20 with a good outdoor understanding and other people were the only things that scared me. I remember after I got back to the cabin and asked my Dad what animal out there [if he knew] that whistled like us but much louder, he didn\u0092t know of any.",
