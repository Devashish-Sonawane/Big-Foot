            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness stated there was no vocalization until after the lights in the cabin were shut off.   Immediately after that, the vocals began.He felt the noise was very primate-like such as what you would expect to hear around the chimpanzee enclosure at a zoo.  The witness also described the experience of listening to this sound as though there was an echo and he guestimated that the origin of the sound came from the west side of the cabin in the thick pines. It was very dark outside so the exact origin of the sound could not be seen.  Due to the presence of the children and the fact that the cabin's tenants were new to the area, he did not talk about the possible originator of the whooping call.   \"Owl-like sounds\" were as close  as any reference to it got. It was also confirmed that until he had this experience the witness gave very little thought to the possiblity of bigfoot being real.  He had an earlier experience in California as a younger man but he wrote that off as just something weird at the time.  Once he heard this  vocalization he spent some time on the internet searching for some answers to the mystery.   His main concern were their privacy and not frightening their friends by identifying the likely originator of the vocalizations.  ",
