The following details can be added to the report:--Located about 10 miles from report 2942, which happened the same week.--During the incident, he felt like he was being watched.  All of his alarms went off (hair raised on the back of his neck; goosebumps, etc.).--Did not smell anything during the incident.--Noted that there are dug out ditches in the area used for raising trout.  Witness had the impression that whatever screamed had been at the ditch getting an easy meal, and they may have interrupted them.--Noted that in previous years, marmots were everywhere.  Not so this year.--After a good conversation about mountain lions and owl sounds/behavior, I believe the scream heard can not be attributed to those creatures.",
