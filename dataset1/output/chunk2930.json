            "Observed": "In the summer of 2010, my family had met my sister and her family at the end of a bay at Tappan lake in Harrison county, Ohio. We were fishing at a point of the bay where you had to walk approximately 40 to 45 yards to the lake shore. My wife Amy had decided to walk back to our van for another chair and I decided to go with her because the trail was a bit winding through the woods. As we went, we heard a \"whooping\" sound not too far from our location. My wife asked me what it was and having never heard anything like it at the time and thinking rationally, I said it was an owl.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I contacted the witness by phone and arranged to meet at the location of the encounter.I met the witness at 3:00 in the afternoon at the same location where he parked his vehicle the night of the encounter. We then proceeded to retrace the path they took to their fishing location along the bank of the northern point of North Bay at Tappan Lake. The distance was about 100 yards from where the vehicle was parked.It was around midnight the night of the incident, they had gotten a fire started and placed their poles out when they decided that they needed another chair. The witness grabbed a flashlight and walked with his wife back the path towards the vehicle. About 45 yards down the trail, his wife stopped and asked him what that sound was. The witness didn't hear the first one, but then, seven more \"whoops\" a few seconds apart that he did hear, soon followed. Not familiar with that sound, the witness wanting to reassure his wife, told her it was an owl.The brush and timber was very thick and in the darkness, they could not see that far with the flashlight. The ground in the direction that the sound came from, gently rose to a ridge that could be seen on the skyline about 300 yards away.They didn't hear any other \"whoops\" that night. A few years later while watching an episode of Finding Bigfoot, his wife heard the sound that she remembered from that night.Tappan lake is part of the Muskingum Watershed Conservatory District.  The lake covers 2,350 acres along with 5,000 acres of land surrounding it. The small village of Deersville sits above the southern side of the lake on the ridge, with the nearest town over seven miles away.There have been many reports over the years of sightings of unknown animals and sounds echoing down the hollers and over the lake.",

            "Observed": "I went to visit my brother who had gotten a firefighting job up in Montana recently and on one of his days off, I wanted to go up into the secluded woods on a hike. Since he was working with the forestry service, he knew of a place that was very secluded and was extremely thick forested. We hiked about a mile and a half up into the mountains and about half way up, we crossed a little creek about 4 to 5 feet wide. I stopped and pulled out my phone to take a picture of the upstream view. I got the picture and we continued on without realizing what he had just done. Later that night I was going through the pictures of that days hike, when I came across something in one of the pictures that was extremely startling. About 45-50 feet from where I took the picture, there was a black figure that seemed to be sitting near the bank of the creek looking right as us. Curious about what I had seen, a few days later when my father arrived to visit my brother, I took him to the place I had taken the picture. Sure enough, where there had so clearly been something sitting next to the creek, there was nothing. In fact there were even freshly broken branches off trees that were no where near the spot it was sitting. I took more photos with my father sitting in where we suspected it was and there is a clear and definite difference where there was a figure sitting, nothing sitting there, and my dad sitting in the same place.",
