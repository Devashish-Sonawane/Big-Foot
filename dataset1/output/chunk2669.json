The following details can be added to the report:\u0095 The witnesses found footprints in the yard on two occasions. The witnesses found the first set of prints outside the tent on October 6, and a second set about 40 feet east of the tent area on October 19. They took pictures of both sets of prints.\u0095 The footprints found on October 6 were in wet sand. Only one of the footprints was complete.  \u0095 The footprint was 14 inches long, 6 inches wide at the ball of the foot and 4 inches at the heel.\u0095 The footprints found on October 19 were in a muddy, ash area. The detail was not as good as the previous prints but they were preserved enough that I was able to observe them when I visited the site on October 22.\u0095 The pictures do show all five toes. However, neither photo contains enough detail to include with this report.I spoke with the brother about what happened when he was sleeping in the tent. He stated that he had spent a lot of time in the woods and is not afraid of anything. He woke up at about 12:30 in the morning and had a very intense uneasy feeling. He said \"The Lord\" told him to get up immediately and go into the house. He put his shoes on, went outside, looked completely around the tent and seeing nothing, went in the house where he slept the rest of the night on the couch.I took the following photo of the woods behind the house:",
