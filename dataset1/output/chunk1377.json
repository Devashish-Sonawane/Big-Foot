The witness and his friend had startled the deer on the way to their camping site and shone lights on them. However, the deer only glanced at them and seemed more concerned with the woods behind them. He stated that the deer remained wary and agitated for nearly 5 minutes, during the time he and his friend observed the deer. The witness and his friend heard the vocalization once they began to walk away and the deer walked back into the woods.He stated that while it sounded like the gibbon call on the BFRO site (and other recordings he found on the Internet), it also sounded like it had more \"weight or body\" behind it, definitely bigger than a gibbon.The witness added that he is a naturalist and spends much of his time in the woods, but he has NEVER heard anything like this call. He is comfortable with identifying many of the animals you would expect in the woods, such as owls, coyotes, deer and so on, but this had him baffled.",
