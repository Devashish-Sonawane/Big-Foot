I came around a corner and was a good distance from the vehicle in front of me, approx 200 yards or so. And a Bigfoot crossed the road between us.  It was early morning so it was still dark and I saw it in the headlights of my jeep.  It crossed the road from left to right in front of me in maybe three or four steps.  It was taller than the truck that was in front of me, later as I caught up to the truck I found out t was a full size Chevy 1500.  The Bigfoot was upright on two legs and was brownish, grayish in color.  It disappeared off the right side of the road up a hill into the brush.",

The driver in the truck in front of him did not appear to notice the creature standing on the side of the road. (No brake lights or slowing down were noted). It is a two-lane highway and took 3-4 steps to cross 20-25 feet. Not running or even in a hurry. It was at least 6.5 feet tall and probably taller, based on it being taller than the truck, as stated, a full sized pick up. It stepped easily over a guardrail and walked up a steep hill (did not run or jump) and disappeared into the brush. Entire event was 15-30 seconds. He was traveling about 40-45 MPH. He is very familiar with the wildlife in the area, spent a lot of time on farms and around animals, and is quite certain of what it wasn't, and pretty sure of what it was. Bulky build if he were to guess, but it was walking away from him. Very matter of fact, laid back, and there was no embellishment. Very reliable, articulate and believable. No preconceived notion one way or the other of Sasquatch prior to the event. ",
