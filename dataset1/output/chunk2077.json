            "Follow-Up Report": "I interviewed this witness for approximately 30 minutes and she was able to elaborate with the following details. The couple was stopped at a four way intersection and were reviewing a map when oncoming headlights caused them to look upwards when they saw the creature pass in front of the car. It was within an arm's length of the front bumper. The face was described as \"somewhere between ape and human\". The hair appeared to be reddish brown. The height estimate was determined by comparing the animal to the vehicles.As the witnesses considered approaching the car that had stopped directly across from them - the car abruptly took off at a high rate of speed, indicating that the occupants had also witnessed the creature. This is a rural area with significant stretches of state game land. Considering the sighting took place over 30 years ago it is safe to say that it was even more desolate with much less development. It has a strong game population. It is feasible that the area has the size and food source to support sasquatch activity. Will update this report if we are able to locate the old newspaper article she is referring to.",
