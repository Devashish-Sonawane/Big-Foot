Also, we noted a large pile of scat behind the cabin and figured it was a bear.  However, I have never seen bear poop in the wild, and have no idea what it looks like.  It was bigger than what a person would leave, and had tons more roughage in it; it was very dark brown and fibrous.  No prints though.  My husband is rather adamant that it is bear poop.  Probably is. But I wanted to cover my bases here.",

I continued to listen until it stopped, and had it gotten any closer, had planned on grabbing my kids and heading into the cabin, upstairs, and pulling the ladder up with us!",

This witness has listened to many of the sounds that are on the BFRO website, but they only sounded similar to what she heard.The sounds that the creature(s) were making lasted about 5 to 10 seconds each time, and would come and go at different intervals over a period of an hour or more.She described those sounds as mostly non-threatening, though they seemed to be coming from a very large animal. CC couldn\u0092t be sure if there was more than one animal or not, but some of the OOOOH-- OOOOH sounds were further away.  The witness listened for over an hour, but her husband probably only listened for about half that time.I did ask if the cabin had been broken into, and I was advised that it had never been broken into during the many years that they had been going to this location.The area that this family was camping in is a remote, private, gated area inside a national forest that has a few cabins. There are cattle that spend their summers in and around this meadow area.The witness also stated the she thought the one making vocalizations closest to her and her family's location was somewhere between \u00bc to one mile away. I also asked her if she had attempted to talk with any of the other folks who were spending their weekends at that location, to inquire if they ever heard anything strange. She advised me that she never has made contact, but she will ask in the future, and let us know. I also advised her to leave out some food next time, and be prepared to record any sounds that may come around. ",
