Less than fifty feet in front of us we saw a huge dark figure go across the road. I distinctly remember the arms because they were long and very massive. You could see the definition of the muscles. It crossed the road from left to right.My heart kind of stopped for a second because did I just see what I think I just saw. And my wife and my daughter asked me \"What was that?\" You could see his arm, it was well defined, you could see his shoulder, this thing was huge. And it was not a man, it was not a bear because we don't have bears here. It was huge.In summary:\u0095 The animal was over 7 feet tall. \u0095 The animal was massive and weighed over 600 lbs.\u0095 The hair was very dark in coloring.\u0095 The witness had his car headlights on high beam.\u0095 The witness was awestruck on how huge the animal was.
