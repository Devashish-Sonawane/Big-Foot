            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness about his sighting and he had the following to add: Mr. A.S. was 9 years old at the time of the sighting. He had left the door briefly open to his home and his outdoor cat harriedly raced in. As he was retrieving the cat from beneath the bed in his room, he glanced up and noticed a very large silhouette move past his window. There is a dirt slope seven to eight feet beyond the window and a tree-line. That was where the figure was walking. The witness said he was leaning down and glancing upward, out the window which gave him a good view of the slope, the treeline, the unusually bright night sky and of course, the bigfoot. I asked him why he did not think it was a local mountain man cutting through his property and he replied, \"The arms gave it away. They swung like heavy pendulums.\"He added its gait was fluid-like and it was hunched over. The hair came down its neck and there was no division between the head and neck. He described the hair as shaggy and its overall stature as hulk-like. Mr. A.S. still resides at the property and in November of 2004 heard heavy stomping noises around his home again. The stomps happened intermittently for two months and ceased. Black Mountain has remained heavily wooded and sparsely populated until the past few years. New housing developments are being constructed on the mountain. Mr. A.S. is part of a construction crew currently working on one of the developments.  ",
