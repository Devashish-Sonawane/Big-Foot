            "Observed": "In the 1980 to 1985 time period, my wife and I spent almost every week-end spring through fall at my sister's place on Santee Cooper, and because we liked travelling off the beaten path, usually travelled on highway 97 through Liberty Hill, SC both ways. to Cross, SC.  One Sunday evening very late (11:00pm or so) as we drove toward Great Falls on highway 97, I rounded a curve to the right, and saw a big erect creature with a very athletic body, and covered with hair, crossing the road about 50 feet in front of me.  I hit the breaks to avoid hitting the creature, aand shouted, \"Look! \" to my wife, who was about to nod off in the passenger's seat.  The creature turned his head to look at me, and continued to cross the road into the trees.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "E.H. told me that this incident happened quickly.  The creature looked at him as it crossed the road and although the view of the shoulders was not straight on, he could tell they were wide. I asked about the neck on the animal and he stated there was one and you could see it, but it was not prominent. At its closest, the creature was approximately 50 feet away. The observer had to brake for it.  Surprised, but more intrigued, E.H felt this creature was approximately that of his own height - around six feet tall.  But he mentioned to me that he did not have anything to really compare it to, so that was just his best guess given the circumstances.     The movement of the sasquatch was fast and the incident happened quickly with E.H. pointing it out to his wife, who saw the hairy back as it entered the woods.  As it entered the woods it seemed to just melt into it.  It didn't really separate the vegetation. The woods it entered were described as maybe 20 to 30 year old growth. Words like powerful, athletic adult (basketball player), light on its feet, and muscular were used to describe its movements.  Its hair seemed well groomed and it gave a look of intelligent eyes.  Its body proportions were human-like but perhaps it was longer waisted.  Also, the hair on the body seemed uniform with the head hair, maybe being just a bit longer. No eye reflection was noticed and I asked about a possible brow and E.H. felt that there was.  He had the feeling that hair was covering most if not all of the face of this creature.He did NOT remember a sloping forehead but felt that the brow area either was enlarged or had more hair there.  Its nose was not particularly prominent.",
