He was sleeping in his cabin alone when he woke to find a large bi-pedal creature in his cabin and he watched it as it moved from bunk to bunk smelling the beds.  He pretended to be asleep when it got to his bed.  He said he could feel it standing over him and watching him, and he continued to pretend to sleep.  He said he stayed like that for awhile until he could no longer feel its presence in the cabin. He told us this after we told him what I had seen.  He said he didn't want to come back but because we were in need of counselors he came back to work.   There was also the experience I had about 3 years earlier with the crying/moaning, but that was the only experience I had that summer.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "After discussing this report with the original submitter and then with her boyfriend, both witnesses consistently recounted their observations as described above and a few details can be added. The lasting impression upon them from their unusual experiences seemed clear. They insisted on confidentiality for themselves and the campground where the claimed events took place.In her possible sighting first described, the figure was at a distance of approximately 40 feet while the light pole next to the cabins was behind it and 80-100 feet away. She described it being visible only as a slightly backlit profile which looked mostly like a person but appeared \"fuzzy\" and was clearly very tall.The possible rock and branch throwing was apparently only experienced at the boys cabins. The boys were very frightened, \"freaked-out\" as he described it, did not want to be left alone, insisted on keeping the fire burning, the door locked and the curtains closed and he mentioned that the boys would sprint back and forth to the outhouse at night. He did find several \"baseball bat sized\" branches on the backside of the cabin between it and the treeline ten feet away but did not notice any footprints.She mentioned that they really mostly didn't believe it themselves while there because, she said,  they tried not to think about it or discuss it much so as not to scare the kids any further and maybe in a kind of denial of their own. It was only after leaving and while on their drive home that they really started to seriously discuss and consider their observations and became convinced that it all really may have been bigfoot related.I camped at this general location in August of 2007 with another BFRO investigator friend and consider it to be an entirely plausible location for the events described, although nothing noteworthy was found during our visit.David Petti",
