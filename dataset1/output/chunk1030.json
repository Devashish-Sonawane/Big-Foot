At that time, a huge black figure took off running through the woods; and it was so fast that it was gone in a matter of seconds. I grabbed the rabbit and ran back up to our house. I didn't go back down to our tank for at least half a year.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone. He added the following information. The \"tank\" he refers to is a small pond. They are common throughout that area and are usually dug with heavy equipment by landowners to provide water for livestock. It was late in the afternoon and the woods were abnormally quiet, devoid of normal woods noise. He was 10-15 yards from the rabbit when he shot it. The large, black, hairy figure was 5-10 yards beyond the rabbit. He only observed the creature in profile view and estimated its height at over 6 feet. The head had a flat face, no snout. He stated that it ran through the brush much faster than a human and was headed downhill toward a dry pond and the fence line bordering his neighbor\u0092s property.On another occasion, while tent camping on the property with friends, late at night, they heard a very deep grunt, close to the tents, that frightened them. No one felt like getting out of the tent to check it out.I found the witness to be sincere and forthcoming in response to my questions.",
