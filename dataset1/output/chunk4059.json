            "Observed.1  ": "professional, for one thing, and he talked about how it smelled. It sounded pretty real. Are there any Bigfoots left in California? What do the Hoopas think?  - Kit Britt, Grass Valley  This is the story that keeps getting talked about at campfires, the reported Bigfoot sighting this month at Oregon Caves National Monument. Whether it's real or not, it's the best camp yarn in years.  The way it goes is that Matthew Johnson, a psychologist, was squatting in the woods near a trail at Oregon Caves National Monument, planning to surprise his wife and three children. Instead, he spotted a Bigfoot 60 feet away. To corroborate his story, Johnson's family told park rangers that although they didn't see a Bigfoot, they had smelled a pungent scent and heard some deep, guttural groans.  \"It was very tall, it was very hairy,\" Johnson said, according to an Associated Press account. \"It was nothing else but a Sasquatch. I swear to God.\"  This story was captivating to me because, believe it or not, I was once hired to find Bigfoot. The Examiner financed six months of preparation followed by a six-week expedition in Northern California and Southern Oregon, primarily scrambling off-trail, trying to live as Bigfoot would live.  I was joined for much of the trip by Michael Furniss, one of the nation's preeminent naturalists and watershed scientists, and Jeffrey Patty, an avid off-trail wilderness explorer and photographer.  We spent six months talking with scientists and primate specialists, and researching published accounts. I also spent much of a week with Hoopa tribal elders and medicine men, learning of their culture and their belief in Bigfoot.  We had also researched dozens of hoaxes, like the time a guy in a gorilla suit jumped into the woods from along a road - right as a Greyhound bus went by. A co-conspirator aboard the bus shouted, \"Look! Bigfoot!\" And just like that, there was a busload of eyewitness accounts, many of which include lengthy detail (to the conspirators' glee).  After the latest sighting, the first response is that Cave Junction is an unlikely habitat for Bigfoot. Cave Junction is located near Highway 199, between Crescent City and Grants Pass, Oregon. The Oregon Caves are a major tourist destination, easy to reach and crowded, and outside the Monument the area has been heavily logged, both reasons for Bigfoot to never be there.  But a likely habitat is located about 20 miles to the west, in the interior of the extremely remote Kalmiopsis Wilderness. The lush interior of the Kalmiopsis, which produces the headwaters of the Chetco River, is surrounded by hot, craggy country like a moat surrounding a castle. That is why there are species here not found anywhere else in the world, such as the Kalmiopsis flower, for which the wilderness is named, and some of the biggest Jeffrey pines anywhere.  If the Bigfoot sighting was true, there is one logic that supports it: A recent forest wildfire devoured much of the Kalmiopsis, and the logic is that Bigfoot could thus be forced out to more populous areas in search for food.  In our expedition, we identified ideal habitat for Bigfoot in the Kalmiopsis, but no Bigfoot. In fact, everything we saw that suggested Bigfoot could later be explained.  The footprints in a snowfield that were 17 inches long and 6 inches wide, which appeared to be from a Bigfoot tracking us, we figured out were my own size 13 boot prints. Over the course of a few days, the snow had melted out around them; we had figured it out by the distance of the stride, 18 to 19 inches from toe to heel, the stride of someone 6-1 or 6-2, not 8 or 9 feet tall.  After stalking and waiting, the glimpse of the large furry creature turned out to be a large black bear with brown fur. The strange sound in the woods of Bigfoot striking a hollow log with a stick was actually the mating call of a blue grouse. The discolored pool of water, where Bigfoot had been washing had also turned out to be from a bear. Other less-striking but curious moments had also been explained.  At one point, I went to the Hoopa Valley and spent several days with Jimmy Jackson, a tribal elder, then 75.  \"You will never see him,\" Jackson told me one day. \"You will see only his footprints.\"  Jackson eventually explained that while Bigfoot is known among his people as Ohmahah, \"Wild Man of the Woods,\" they believe he is a spirit in a metaphysical world who leaves only footprints. That is why they aren't surprised when they hear of giant footprints being discovered, but raise a skeptical eyebrow at tales of sightings.  As for me, well, we wrote a song on our expedition, and the last verse goes like this:  \"Animals? We seen 'em all.  \"But Bigfoot? Can't recall!\" ",

            "Observed.1  ": "By JOHN BUCHEL - GM Today Staff   November 12, 2006   WEST BEND - A 39-year-old Menasha man has found himself in the middle of Washington County \"wildman of the wilderness\" fever. Steven Krueger doesn\u0092t know where all this Bigfoot talk came from, but he will not be sorry to see it stop. \"I hope it just goes away. It\u0092s starting to get irritating,\" Krueger said. \"I never once said it was a Bigfoot or yeti.\" The sheriff\u0092s department report bears that out, only mentioning a creature \"approximately 7 feet tall, very black, and very wide.\" After some kind of creature startled Krueger early Thursday morning while he was working at his Department of Natural Resources-contracted job, he deliberated reporting it because he knew there would be skeptics. Krueger finally decided he should alert the sheriff\u0092s department in case it was a bear or other dangerous animal. Krueger said he used to hunt black bears, which is what this animal looked like. Except for the ears. \"They were sort of pointy - not exactly like a wolf, but definitely not rounded like a black bear,\" Krueger said. The DNR contracts and specially licenses Krueger to remove deer carcasses in Washington, Ozaukee, Fond du Lac, Brown, northern Manitowoc and northern Waupaca counties. \"Washington County faxes me every morning and gives me a complete list and exact location of where the deer are, and I make a run,\" Krueger told the Daily News in May. At around 1 a.m. Thursday morning, he stopped to pick up a small doe on Highway 167, about a third of a mile east of Station Way Road in the town of Erin. He put the deer in the bed of the truck and sat in the cab, filling out the necessary paperwork. He left the gate down, because he still had to tag the deer. Krueger felt the truck rock and thought it was the wind, but when it rocked again he checked his mirror to see - in the light of his truck-mounted spotlight - an animal reaching for the doe with its front paws. He said he was startled, so he slammed the truck into drive and peeled off. The deer was dragged - or fell - off the truck, along with an all-terrain vehicle ramp. Krueger couldn\u0092t be sure exactly what he saw. \"A black Lab(rador retriever) could\u0092ve jumped in the back of the bed and it would\u0092ve startled me because I wasn\u0092t expecting it,\" Krueger said. Krueger said Milwaukee television stations had contacted him trying to push the Bigfoot angle. He said kept the discussion away from that direction but they ran the story anyway. He\u0092s asked for a correction. The attention had the area abuzz with the idea of a southeastern Wisconsin sasquatch. \"That\u0092s the word we were bombarded with,\" said Bill Mitchell, the county\u0092s DNR conservation warden. \"We were working this morning and everywhere we went people wanted to know about it.\" With hunting season coming up, folks joked with Mitchell about licensing: Would it require a big game or a small game license, or would an archery license work? About 60 people from the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization hit the trail this summer for two three-day weekend expeditions in Wisconsin\u0092s northern Price County looking for yetis. Around the same time, Bigfoot footage was posted on the video-sharing Web site YouTube, claiming to have been shot on the Fourth of July near St. Croix Falls in Polk County. A total of 34 Wisconsin sightings have been reported to the BFRO Web site, ranking it smack in the middle of the lower 48 United States, but not a single report has come out of Washington County or any in southeastern Wisconsin. Mitchell said although rare, there was history of timber wolf black bear and large coyote sightings in the area and as far south as Milwaukee County, which could account for what Krueger saw. But, then again ... \"My wife just pointed out Halloween Express just sold off all their costumes at clearance prices,\" Mitchell said. Krueger said it was inconceivable the creature was a prankster. He didn\u0092t see a single other vehicle or person as he drove down Highway K to calm himself, or when he went back briefly to search for his ATV ramp. By Friday afternoon, someone sent the sasquatch story to Jeffrey Meldrum, a professor of anatomy and anthropology at Idaho State University. As one of the world\u0092s foremost authorities on Bigfoot, he\u0092s familiar with the sensation a sighting can stir. \"I\u0092ve been out with people and every puddle of water that has a remote shape of a humanoid footprint they go, \u0091Ah, look at that! Could that be a Bigfoot print?\u0092\" Meldrum said. Last week, The Associates Press ran a story about colleagues who shun Meldrum for practicing quack science. Ironically, Meldrum\u0092s new book, endorsed by world-famous primatologist Jane Goodall, is \"Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science.\" \"From my perspective, I\u0092m not dealing with just the accumulation of those stories and reports,\" Meldrum said. \"As a physical anthropologist I constrain myself to a consideration of a data that lends itself to scientific analysis.\" Many academics and laypersons alike won\u0092t denounce the legend, but also won\u0092t acknowledge evidence until there is a smoking gun - or a sasquatch skeleton, he said. Meldrum said he takes the scientific route. \"I\u0092ll see a feature in a print which looks to me like a midtarsal pressure ridge, which makes it very different and much more flexible than a human\u0092s foot,\" Meldrum said. \"So let\u0092s do some experiments.\" His tests range from examining other apes\u0092 prints, to plotting sightings against environmental habitat using geographic information systems, to studying bio-acoustics of animal vocalizations. Personal beliefs aside, he bases his findings on the data, which he feels supports the idea of a species behind the legend. Krueger said if Bigfoot did exist, it would probably live in a more remote environment like the Rockies or the Pacific Northwest, but \"anything\u0092s possible.\" \"I\u0092m not sure how I would react personally if I ever saw one,\" Meldrum said. \"I\u0092ve had people tell me it\u0092s a life-changing possibility because they\u0092ve been told their whole lives that this thing could not possibly exist and now, boom! Large as life, it\u0092s there.\"  ",
