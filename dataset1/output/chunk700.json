            "Observed": "I and my friends were hiking at the eatonville waterfalls when we smelt a wet dog musky sweet smell. We figured it was elk or a bear. When we turned the corner by the middle fall there was a huge black creature crouching over like a human drinking from the river. My buddy gave a suprised yelp and it looked up stared at us for a minute then moved lightning quick into the trees.",
            "AirportCode": "",
            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was hiking to a popular spot just south of the town of Eatonville, Washington. This location is where a branch of the Mashel River flows over a waterfall about 30\u0092 high. The location is approximately 200 yards from the highway parking area. I was hiking at that spot recently, so I am familiar with the location. It is very near the Pack Forest, which has a long history of sasquatch sightings, track lines in the snow, and other activity (including stealing a trail worker's lunch).They hiked from the road, across the railroad trestle, and down the trail to the right of the railroad tracks. This trail has a cable strung along it to use as a hand hold. The trail is quite steep. In talking to the witness, I gathered these additional details: It had not heard them approach over the sound of the river. After about ten seconds of staring at the three people, it turned away from the river and moved rapidly off into the trees to the southwest on two legs. As it moved away, it paused three times to turn and look at them. The witness said this was the time when he was worried about whether or not it would attempt to approach them. He said that it turned its entire body to look at them. He got a really good look at the animal. It was only about 60 feet away when they first saw it. By the time it had moved about 50 feet away from the river, it vanished into the brush. The location is such that throughout most of the day, the river is in the shade, so the ability to see fine detail is not very good.  The witness gave me a good description of the creature's appearance:  The color of the fur was black underneath, but a rusty red at the tips.  The fur was long and straight. The face was wide, like an orangutan.  The skin color was a reddish-tan; like someone who has been using too much fake tanning cream. He could not see detail of the mouth, nose, or eyes due to the lighting. The head was cone-shaped on top.  There was no visible neck. The arms were very long, reaching nearly to its knees. The hands were large, like the picture of Michael Jordan holding a basketball. It looked like a huge human with fur.  He estimated the height at 6\u00924\u0094. (They were above the creature looking down, so height estimation is problematic). The witness is a body builder and weighs 300 lbs. He said by comparison this creature was much bigger; he estimated its weight at 500 lbs. The build was massive, with huge shoulders.  Vocalizations: He said that it made a \u0093clearing its throat sound\u0094 as it rose to turn and walk away. It sounded just like a human clearing its throat when they are annoyed at being disturbed. Being familiar with the location, the history of sasquatch sightings in this area, and with the excellent description of the creature, I am convinced that this witness saw a sasquatch.",

            "Follow-Up Report": "On the evening of April 9, 2007 this witness and I talked for well over an hour discussing his encounter. It happened above the mining area of French Gulch, California back in June of 1991. One of the reasons that M.L.D. went into this wilderness area was to try and show his son where he and his father and uncle used to go when he was his age. He never found the exact spot, but when he found the large pine cones he thought that was enough progress for that night, and he was tired as well. He turned his pick-up truck around, leaving the lights on. He got out of his truck and opened up the camper shell door and the pick-up truck's tail gate. He began to gather up the large pine cones and put them into the back of the truck. As he was picking up the pine cones he heard the eerie screech coming from the ridge behind his truck. He dropped the pine cones he had gathered and started to make a retreat. He then heard some loud thumping sounds that were getting louder as they approached him.  They sounded like two large feet hitting the ground and as they got closer. That sound, plus the screeching sound immediately before, made him tremble with fear. He knew that it wasn\u0092t a bear or an elk, or anything else that he knew about that lives out in that forest. As he closed the door of his truck and started up the engine, he observed a large dark form in his rear view mirrors moving towards his truck. The figure was slightly illuminated by the truck tail lights. There was also some moonlight that helped define the figure. He saw it for about 5 seconds. He could only see from the shoulders down to its knees. It was a an upright man-like figure. In his estimation it weighed several hundred pounds.  He could see the shoulders. One of its arms hung down, and the other appeared to be moving up as the figure was moving towards the truck. The fur seemed shaggy but the body looked very strong and muscular. He thought the hair on its chest was shorter than the hair on its arms. He recalled that the figure seemed to have a reddish tone to its fur, but he thinks that was probably the tail light's reflection. The open camper shell door shielded the tail light illuminaton from the shoulders of the figure on up.M.L.D. is a disabled Army veteran. He was wounded in action. I thanked him for his service and sacrifices for his country. I also thanked him for  the story of his encounter. This incident shook this gentleman to his core, and it still bothers him. He felt as if he was trespassing on something's protected property.My wife and I took this same road about 12 or 15 years ago when we wanted to see some back country by going through Redding, and then up Hwy 5 to Lakehead, which is located at the north end of Shasta Lake. We decided to take this back road out of French Gulch, going north to Dog Creek Rd. and then east to Hwy. 5, and then south to Lakehead. My wife still remembers the weird wood cutting sign that M.L.D. described.I received the following e-mail message from him on 04-10-07:Richard, For what it's worth, I remembered another thing when I was visiting at Shasta Dam. I had spent so much time up at that dam as an teen.  I remembered a few hours later after speaking with you when I visited the dam I went inside with my son and signed the visitors book. This accounted for my presence in the Redding area for that time period for the year and month and day Jun/1991 approximately 12-15 June and the trip to French Gulch was at least 2 days after the visit to Shasta Dam!!All my son can account for was the situation as he woke up and saw me driving and very scared. He remembers how scared I was, and remembers me talking about it once in a while. He was so little back then and it was hard to explain at his age what it was that I had seen. He did hear the conversation with his great Uncle Bill, and his Uncle Bill teasing me. But even Uncle Bill declined to go back up their with me when I teased him back. He was a Bronze star war hero that saved many lives in some of the famous battles in the Korean war. He's got two Purple Hearts but he got pretty jittery about going up their to French Gulch area!! He wouldn\u0092t have any part of it!! It is hard when one does not know what they are up against -- the unknown. When this happened to me that night it was the unknown what I was faced with. My first experience with serious fear was in South Korea in Aug 76, when we nearly went to war when the tree was cut down at Panmunjon at the38th parallel (D.M.Z.) I saw at age 19 what near war was like for the first time and was placed on an motor gun I had no training on. I had wanted so dearly an M-60 machine gun I knew 100% how to fight with. Good thing all cooled off in a couple of weeks!! At least some of what I was up against I knew how to face. When the Iranian crisis happened I was in the Mohave Desert training Nov 79  to Dec 79 and well trained to go to battle. Yet when we loaded up on the C-130's and we were on our way we all sweated some fear of the unknown. Yet we were aware what we were about to face, in some ways.  When the incident happened that night above French Gulch I felt a fear that shook me to the core. It is difficult to convey that kind of fear. I was caught totally unawares, and didn't know what this thing was, or what action I could take. I feel I did the best thing I could do given the situation. One thing, I just may have shot a warning shot in the air as I had learned as a soldier to do. If that didn\u0092t work I would have chosen to skedaddle anyway. Only when faced with what one can see can one choose to point the gun and shoot or not shoot!! If I can remember anything else I'll let you know.                             M.L.D. Retired, U.S. Army Sergeant.[Graphic below added by editor MM  -- Please wait for it to load -- Frame from Google Earth showing location French Gulch area with respect to Mount Shasta , Lake Shasta, Whiskeytown Lake, etc.]---------------------------------------------------------------------Additional information received on July 4, 2007:\"I was viewing your web site last night, and realized that your Case # 18298, submitted by M.L.D. on Monday, March 19, 2007 was very similar to what happened to me on three occasions. # 1 ) July 9, 1983 a few miles north of French Gulch on Shasta County Road 106 ; 2:20 p.m., bright sunshine, very hot summer day with no wind or cloud cover, terrain is mountainous with large areas of heavy brush and large pine and fir trees, creek on east side of road.Stopped to take some pictures of old rusty logging and mining equipment along side of road. After being there for about 30 minutes, started to hear strange sounds coming from a heavily wood area about 150 feet away. Over the next hour this escalated into very loud hoots and screams, tree limbs breaking, and rocks being thrown. The sounds at first seemed to come from one location, BUT, later started coming from the opposite direction also. At that point I figured it was best to leave# 2 ) July 11, 1983 North of French Gulch on Shasta County Road # 106 also called \u0093Trinity Mountain Road\u0094 a place marked \u0093Cosy Dell \u0093on the map. 6 p.m., bright sunshine, very hot with no wind or cloud cover. Terrain is mountainous with heavy brush and large trees.Found a wide spot to pull off the road and parked to take pictures and observe what was happening. When I first stopped there was all kind of sounds from birds, frogs, crickets, that only lasted for 15 to 20 minutes, then it was completely silent, not a sound. Followed by loud crashing sounds, like something was running through the timber at a high rate of speed breaking tree limbs. This was followed by about 45 minutes of dead silent, and then all hell broke loose, rocks and pine cones were being thrown in my direction, loud screams coming from 3 or 4 different locations, I left after about ten minutes when a rock the size of a dinner plate (about 10\u0094) hit the passenger side window of my two month old Chevy pickup truck.# 3 ) July 14, 1983 About 10 a.m. Location marked on map as \u0093Mad Cow Mountain \u0093. It is located west \u0096northwest from Lakehead, CA on the north end of Shasta Lake on Interstate # 5.This area is almost on the Shasta-Trinity County line. To access the area you leave Interstate # 5 at Vollmers and take the Dog Creek Road west.Bright sunshine, very hot, no wind or cloud cover. Terrain is very mountainous with heavy brush and areas of large timber.Arrived at area on the north side of Mad Cow Mountain, not much here other than heavy brush, some areas of large timber, lots old logging skid trails.After about an hour without anything happening, I started to leave when sounds started coming from some heavy timber up hill from where I was. It sounded like two creatures running down hill in my direction, it was crash, crash, crash as they broke tree limbs on there way.After all that noise it became dead quite for 20 minutes or more, I had the feeling that I was not alone, that something was watching me. What followed was pure hell for the next 15 minutes,Rocks, pine cones, tree limbs and clumps of brush with dirt still around the roots was being thrown toward the pickup truck, I began to think I had better get out of here, when everything stopped, not a sound, that lasted about 20 to 30 minutes then I started to here low grunts ( pig like sounds) followed by some very high pitched screams, then the sound of two heavy footed creatures leaving, going back up the north side of Mad Cow Mountain. At this point I was relived and puzzled by what had happened in the last couple hours, since everything seemed to be quite, I decided to break out lunch and see what happened.At about 4 p.m, six hours after I first arrived at this location, I heard calls and hoots coming from the north side of the mountain, followed by the same sounds coming from other directions.A few minute before 6 p.m... nothing happening, was getting ready to leave, when something very heavy landing in the bed of my pickup truck, it was a large clump of brush with a large amount of dirt around the roots, After that I decided to not play this game with creatures that are two to three times bigger then I am, so I made a graceful retreat.My reason for being at those locationsm  because a very elderly ( middle 90\u0092s ) Native American who lived in Yreka, CA  told me about the above areas and said that he lived there when he was in his teens and early 20\u0092s. Told about seeing Bigfoots on many occasions and even interacting with Bigfoots of his own age. He spoke of the Bigfoot in the same terms as he described his early years, \u0093They where there \u0085just part of it \u0093.He described locations where he knew Bigfoots were living and what to expect if you \u0093Trespassed on their lands \u0093I have lived in Siskiyou County since the late 1950\u0092s, owned and operated cattle ranches for over 40 years, hunted and fished most of the wild areas in the north end of California, Southern Oregon,Including the Marble Mountains, Red Buttes, Siskiyou, Mt Shasta, Russian, and Trinity Alps Wilderness Areas.When I first moved to Siskiyou County I didn\u0092t believe in all those tall tales about Bigfoot told to me by old time cattle ranchers who have lived here there whole life.BUT, after many hunting and fishing trips into the back country made me start to realize that what I had seen, heard and smelled were not tall tales but the real thing. A very large creature that walked up right on two legs, very long arms that are massive in size and strength , shy at times, aggressive if you trespass on it\u0092s area. Roger S.530-***-****",
