            "Follow-Up Report": "R.L called me tonight, the tenth of February 2004, from Pennsylvania, and he went over the encounter he had forty years ago in the San Bernardino National Forest, near Big Bear Lake.  For forty years R.L. has wanted to tell his story to someone who might take him seriously, and maybe explain just what might have followed him up that steep canyon. He had been affected with this mystery too long and wanted some closure on this, his most memorable encounter.  R.L. couldn't remember the name of the road, but said that the cabin they were staying in was called Peyton Place. As R.L. was walking up a dark gravel mountain road, towards the cabin, he began to hear something moving up the steep brush covered canyon below him, and it sounded like it was a large bipedal creature. The creature was breaking the brush limbs loudly, and moving loose rocks around, as it continued on up the canyon towards where the road and the canyon intersected.  He said at first, when he walked, the creature moved, and when he stopped, it also would stop. This frightened him enough that the hairs on the back of his head were standing up, and he began to pick up rocks in the road, and then tossed them into the canyon to persuade the creature to stop its advance up towards his location.  This rock throwing didn't slow the creature down as he hoped, but it began to move faster towards the intersection.  R.L. then began to believe he was going to die when the two of them met at the intersection.  Just a few seconds later his Aunt and some of his family came around the corner in their car on the way down the hill looking for him.In summary, I felt this large creature had some intelligence by the way it would stop and start when he did, and it seemed to get a little hostile towards him as he began throwing rocks down on it.  R.L. never heard any sound from the creature, saw or smelled anything out of the ordinary, but his encounter does have some of the same characteristics that sasquatch has shown in the past.  R.L. further stated that the canyon was way too steep for a person to climb, or make the noise it did while breaking branches and moving rocks around on its way up towards him and the road.  ",

            "Observed": "In 1985, I was attending Indiana State University in Terre Haute, IN.  One Saturday morning I was travelling to Chicago to visit relatives. I was driving north on U.S. 41 and I looked to my right down into a small valley (more a depression in the land than a valley) with a small stream running through it. About 100-150 yards from the highway, I saw a large dark-colored creature walking away from the road (to the east.) It was very broad and I could clearly see the creature's arms swinging. My view of the bottom part of it was obscured by tall grass and I could only see the very tops of its legs. The head never turned at all. I saw this for 4-5 seconds before the trees on the north side of the depression obscured my view. There were also trees on the south side. My immediate thought was that I didn't really see what I thought I did. I continued driving, unsure of what to do. After a few minutes, I turned around and drove back past where I had seen it (my view from this side of the highway was blocked), turned around again, drove to the bridge where the sighting occurred and stopped where I had originally seen it. There was nothing there at this time. Not being aware of any sasquatch sightings in this area (or the Midwest in general), and not knowing what else to do, I continued on to Chicago and didn't think much more about it for many years.",
