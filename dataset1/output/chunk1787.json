            "Follow-Up Report": "Following a telephone conversation with this witness, the following details can be added to the report:- The witness reported a foul odor in the area prior to the sightings.  He reported the smell as \"the smell of feet.\"- He reports the larger form higher on the hillside to be the size of \"a portable outhouse.\"- He also reports seeing something cross the road and join the others before they all disappeared over the ridge and out of sight.The witness shared another experience with me from about 12 years earlier.  The witness stated he was deer hunting with his family in an area nearby this location in the early morning hours when he and his cousin had an unusual experience.He stated they were hiking to their deer stands near daybreak when they heard an animal coming down the embankment above them.  Out of the thick brush emerged a deer that, in his words, appeared to be \"drunk.\"  He says the deer was staggering, walking sideways and looking behind him as if he were looking for something following him.He stated even though the deer saw them, it began to come towards them while \"bucking like a bronco.\"  He stated the deer was hopping and bouncing and kicking up its rear legs while approaching their location.As this was during open deer season, they shot and killed the deer and began to field dress it.  Shortly after approaching the downed deer, they heard a very loud vocalization from the brush on the hillside above them.  The witness described the sound as a \"roar / growl that turned into what sounded like a woman screaming.\"  He stated he had never before heard anything similar to that vocalization.The witness then stated they began hearing what sounded like very large tree branches being broken and snapped off, along with a violent thrashing sound.  He stated large, broken off tree limbs were thrown from the brush above them down towards them.He also reported there were very large rocks thrown in their direction from the hillside above them as well.  He says they were obviously thrown over the top of the thick brush and all landed very close to them.  He stated the size of the rocks varied from grapefruit size to watermelon size.It was at this point they decided to abandon the deer kill and evacuate the area and they left immediately. He says they did not return to attempt to retrieve the deer, nor have they returned since then.",
