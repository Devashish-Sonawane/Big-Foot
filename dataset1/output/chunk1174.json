            "Follow-Up Report": "Spoke with witness on the phone. I am very familiar with the area they were fishing - many reports come from the same area. This was also the area the very active 2013 BFRO expedition was held. Witness says he, his wife and friends have been coming out fishing in this spot for years without hearing or seeing anything unusual. As he says in his narrative, they had heard coyotes and lots of owls, when out of nowhere came a long, loud howl. He described it as 5-10 seconds long and of a single tone. He could not see what made the howl, but he felt it was several hundred yards up river (north), and on or close to the bank. After the howl they heard nothing else, and the forest went silent. Coyotes and owls stopped. Witness says they were definitely intimidated, but not so much that he won't go back again.For the record, this area is unfortunately also very active with people doing their own private investigations. Some of those investigators make extremely convincing howls. I did take the time to check with the investigators that I'm aware of in the area and found that none of them were there that night, lending further credence.",
