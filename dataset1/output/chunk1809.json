We had parked to stretch our legs a bit and were standing next to Monte Cristo lake in Snohomish county... My wife points across and asks what those are.  I look and see two hairy creatures walking upright and they were almost a golden brown color... I ran to the car to get camera and binoculars ... When  I got back, both were just walking into thick brush... I wanted to go in after them but my wife was too scared.... Never was able to get back to find track or other signs...",

            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness by phone and he seemed very credible as he recalled the details of his sighting.Additional information provided by the witness:\u0095 The witness and his ex-wife were driving to Darrington and looking for a spot to fish.\u0095 The two animals were walking on two legs from right to left on the opposite side of the lake.\u0095 The color of their hair was a light to golden-brown color.\u0095 The figure in-front was about a foot and-a-half taller than the one behind.\u0095 The one in-front turned to look at the two witnesses but no facial or other physical details could be seen at that distance.\u0095 The witness has hiked a lot around the Mountain Loop Highway and was very excited to see what he believes were two sasquatches.\u0095 The witness did not feel threatened.Lake Monte Cristo is located on the Mountain Loop Highway a couple of miles East of Barlow Pass.  The Mountain Loop Highway has a long history of bigfoot activity, including the following reports:Report # 26353.Report # 25882.Report # 23170.Report # 23017.Report # 16276.Report # 1880.Report # 1722.Report # 1672.The Mountain Loop Highway is a highway in the U.S. state of Washington. It traverses the western section of the Cascade Range within Snohomish County. The name suggests it forms a full loop, but it only is a small portion of a loop, which is completed using State Routes 92, 9, and 530. Part of the highway is also a designated and signed Forest Highway, and is known as Forest Route 20. The highway connects the towns of Granite Falls and Darrington. It is paved for 34 miles (55 km) from Granite Falls to Barlow Pass (2349') where the highway becomes unpaved for 13 miles (21 km), and then paved again for the remaining 9 miles (14 km) to Darrington. The unpaved section is U.S. Forest Service Road #20 and passes several USFS campgrounds. Portions of the unpaved section are often closed for periods of several years due to flood damage.",
