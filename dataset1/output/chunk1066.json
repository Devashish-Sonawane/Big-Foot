            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness on 1/11/05.   He added the following information:- The exact date of the sighting could not be determined.  The witness believes it was late October 2001, approximately 1:00 a.m.- The witness and his friend first noticed the creature standing by the side of the road at a distance of 50 yards.  They thought it was a large woman wearing a dark charcoal gray sweatshirt.  The thought firmly in mind that it was a human standing beside the road resulted in initial shock it was \"a very ugly human\" as they passed and it turned to look at them.  They quickly began to realize that it was not human at all.   The witness described the animal's features as follows:- Height estimated between 8-9 feet.  Because the creature's legs were not visible, it was not possible to gauge the actual height.  The height was estimated by taking into account: it was standing 3-5 feet off the edge of the road's shoulder and the hill sloped down and away with a 70 degree steep bank. The height of the truck's passenger-side window and the creature's head were about the same level.- Big barrel-shaped torso; large breasts; arms about 5 feet long.- Body Hair: dark-charcoal, blackish-gray, very coarse and thick stranded; length could not be determined. (Keep in mind that the sighting occurred at night.)- Head: large and conical shaped (similar to a person wearing a hooded sweatshirt)- Face: Large and broad.- Eyes: Average size, relative to the size of the head They were dark and did not produce any eye-shine.- Nose: Very broad, up-turned nose with large open nostrils. This was its most striking feature.- Mouth: Average in size with thin lips.- Skin Color: Skin-tone was weathered, aged and slightly wrinkled.- Facial Hair: Thinner towards its cheeks with face fully exposed.- Brow Ridge: None observed. Hair may have been hanging down near its eyes obscuring a brow ridge.- No observable neck:  The witness observed that the hair from its head lay upon the shoulders concealing any neck, giving an even smooth body outline.The creature turned its entire torso (not just its head) to look at them when it was about 10 feet in front and off the truck's front fender, just as they were about to pass it.  The truck at this point had slowed to about 20 mph.The witness observed the face for only a couple of seconds at a distance of 6-8 feet from the passenger-side window.  The entire observation time from the point the creature was first spotted until it was no longer visible was about 30 seconds. The witness has heard two vocalizations near his home.  The first vocalization was quite near his house and sounded like a deep-throated growl or grunt.  The second vocalization was a very powerful howl approximately 1/4 mile away.  The witness is an outdoor enthusiast, ex-hunter, avid fisherman, and loves spending time in the outdoors and forest areas.  He seems well versed with the various large animal vocalizations in the northeast United States including coyote, bear, and cougar, but he could not identify these two sounds.  It is important to note that his home is approximately 8 miles away from the sighting incident.",
