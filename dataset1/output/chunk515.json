The scream was very high pitched, blaring, and angry.  Very similar to a howler monkey.I also contacted a former Forest Service employee that worked in the campgrounds in the Kernville area on the Sequoia National Forest (Steve) for more than ten years.  He added the following:--campground was likely the Gold Ledge or Limestone campgrounds;--there are numerous cave-like formations and abandoned mines in the area;--the campground is very near the Golden Trout Wilderness, Fork of the Kern, and Hell For Sure areas, which are all very remote and could easily support a bigfoot population.",
