            "Observed": "As a young person I vaguely remember hearing something about a creature called \"Bigfoot\". I suppose I thought he was something the Indians had conjured up. That is how others seemed to think. Then approximately eight years ago, my sister gave me a book to read during a visit in Florida. I think it was called \"Mysteries of The Unexplained.\" I found it to be an interesting book, especially the story about a creature called \"Bigfoot.\" I don't remember the details, however, I do remember thinking that there is much more to this so-called myth than meets the eye. Sometime later I saw the famous \"Patterson Film\". A film of a large, heavy, hairy, bipedal subject quickly walking away from a startled cameraman and his horse. My curiosity at that point had me wanting to find out for myself what the truth was. Was this creature real or just a never-ending series of hoaxes and grossly exaggerated stories?",
