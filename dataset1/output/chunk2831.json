I was a home health R.N., and told my experience to one of my elderly patients, never expecting her to actually believe me.  (Nobody else had).  Instead, she nodded and said her son and daughter-in-law had been hiking in the watershed,  and from a high hill observed 3 tall, dark, figures walking (upright)across the valley down below.  She said 1 of the figures was much smaller than the other two.  By the time the 2 hikers got down there, the figures were gone, but they found long black hair on a fence they'd crossed.  She said they had the hair sent to a lab for DNA analysis and the report came back that it didn't belong to any known human or animal.  That account put another notch in my new believing-in-bigfoot belt!",
