Babs W. who lives by west entrance to [Backbone State Park] 5 mi SE of here, pulled into her place saw a bigfoot walking across a field and into the park, in late fall 1979. There was snow on ground. Later she heard screams and howls that scared her horses for several days as this went on. She reported it to a park ranger. He told her she probably saw a bear. She said it was no bear. It walked on two legs and steped over a fence while she watched it.",
