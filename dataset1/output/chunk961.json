            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was interviewed several times in person and by phone in the weeks following the alleged incident and an in-person investigation to the sighting location was conducted to document the details and corroborate the witness' story with the actual location several weeks after it occurred.  I have also been able to listen to the witness' story of his experience several times as he shared it with others. Measurements on the distance between the witness and the figure were taken, and the approximate height was determined based on a re-creation from the witness' perspective. The figure's approximate width and body proportions were estimated by comparing my own body measurements to the witness' observation of the subject.Following a tip from a nearby camper, the witness woke before sunrise and went to a specific area in hopes of harvesting a bear and also to photograph the local deer & elk. After observing the area, he chose to sit down motionless amongst a small grove of trees facing south/southwest on the far side of a watering hole at a clearing to watch for game. The following photos were sent to the BFRO and were taken by the witness moments after the encounter:After approximately thirty minutes, the figure appeared silently from the left of the witness' field of vision and stayed in view for what was perceived to be about forty-five seconds. It appeared to be standing behind a fallen tree elevated off the ground at the edge of the clearing with sunlight glaring off of its back-right side. The subject made no noticeable body movements other than to move out of view to the witness' right. The figure's retreat was described as \"ghost like\" and smooth and it made no sounds or vocalizations during the incident. The witness stated that he felt as though the figure was watching him but he could not confirm this due to lighting conditions and distance. Please refer to the following photo for the lighting conditions and the fallen tree mentioned above.The distance between the witness and the figure was measured to be 483 feet (161 yards, 147.2 meters). Based on comparisons to my own height and a tree for reference, the figure's approximate height was measured at seven foot nine inches (2.32 meters) and it had an approximate shoulder width of thirty to thirty three inches (2 foot 6-9 inches, .76-.83 meters). One of the body details that were noticed was that the figure's elbow height was above the tree it was standing behind. Measurements at the scene put the elbows of the figure at about four foot nine inches. To compare that to my own measurements at a standing height of five foot ten inches, my elbow height was measured at three foot eight and 1/2 inches, which is about a foot lower than the figure. Interestingly, with a total height difference of approximately two feet between the figure and the investigator, this means that the figure had disproportionately longer arms than my own. This is known in science as a having a longer intermembral index. In other words, the figure was about two feet taller but its elbows were only about one foot higher off the ground. Furthermore, calculations determined that the top of the figure's head to its elbows came out to approximately 38% of its total standing height compared to my own proportions of 36.5%. A difference of only 1.5%, seemingly similar until you consider that the figure's profile showed a short or almost missing neck, putting the jaw line well below the shoulder line, which the witness also noted. This contrasts sharply with a typical human profile with a pronounced neck, putting the chin & jaw line well above the shoulder line. What this means is that, despite having almost no neck, the body proportions from the figure's elbows to the top of its head was still a larger in proportion to its total height. This \"long armed\" appearance is a feature consistent with many documented encounters throughout North America over many decades and would be an unlikely detail for the witness to know since it was discovered only after measurements were calculated after the investigation was completed.   Map of the location with placemarks:The witness has declared that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol of any type at the time of the incident. I am confident based on testimony, photographs, measurements taken in person and from mathematical calculations that the witness did indeed see a large upright figure as described on the morning of August 21st, 2011 that was clearly beyond human size and not a misidentification of a known animal nor an optical illusion. I submit to the reader to decide for him or herself what this means.",
