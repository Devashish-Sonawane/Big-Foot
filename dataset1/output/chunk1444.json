            "Follow-Up Report": "I spoke with the witness, and her sister for nearly 2 hours. The reporting witness had just had surgery and was having trouble speaking. Her sister had stopped by to check on her and coincidentally we had already scheduled this call. Both sisters were there on the night of the event, so I got a great deal of data between the both of them. As they spoke to each other, and then to me, they both remembered little things that one may have forgotten but the other remembered. A very enlightening conversation.As stated they went to their Uncle and Aunt\u0092s farm same time every year. This event happened sometime between 1973 & 1975. They went there many other times but this event was narrowed down to \u009273 to \u009275 because of the ages they were at the time. Her two uncles went to a farm meeting this night, as they did same time once a month regular as clockwork. The bedroom the sisters were in was right off the living room and they had a clear view of the living room. As noted, most all doors and all the windows were open. The inner front door was open, and the outer door, which was half metal and half screen was closed, but you still got the breeze coming in.Out of nowhere came a very piercing scream, which they described as \u0093a very loud baby in a tunnel\u0094. It was not a sound they had ever heard before. Now the aunt who owned the home was born and raised on a farm, and she was described as \u0093a 70 year old spitfire not afraid of anything, man nor beast\u0094. They said the sound was coming from \u0093up the hill\u0094 which was 50 yards from the front door of the home. Straight out the front door. As the sisters sat up in bed with their \u0093hair standing up on their arms\u0094 their Aunt ran into the main bedroom and grabbed a shotgun. She was heading towards the front door \u0093to go out and take care of business\u0094.  The screaming continued and was getting closer. The witnesses mom and other aunt were screaming at the aunt to stop and not go outside. By then the sisters were in the living room totally freaked, after their mom called for them to get in there with the rest of them. Their mom then slammed the front door before the aunt could get out the door.    At this point the screaming was coming just outside the door. The sound was rattling the whole house. The aunt then said \u0093she was going to shoot who or what ever right through the door\u0094. The creature then walked to the right and crossed right in front of the open picture window. Now there was a yard light up on a pole in the front yard, so the creature was back lit and they could clearly see through the sheer curtains, the \u0093shape and outline of a huge man about 7ft. tall walking hunched over\u0094. They later guessed it was walking hunched over so as not to bump it\u0092s head on the eave of the home. (Though the original witness recalled it being \u0093dark outside and we couldn\u0092t see much\u0094, the other sister remembered that the yard was back lit and she and her mom saw it more clearly). Her mom and the Aunt then opened the front door and that is when they saw \u0093the leg of the thing, a very hairy mans leg\u0094. \u0093It was walking away from them, screaming and beating on the house with it\u0092s right arm\u0094. When they saw it, they screamed, and it screamed back at them\u0094. Same piercing scream. The creature walked around the corner of the house, heading towards the chicken coop. It slapped the house once more, screamed, and then was gone. The entire event lasted about 10 minutes. It screamed a total of 4 or 5 times. They felt like the creature was either \u0093trying to get in the house or trying to get them out of the house\u0094. It was noted that the event did not begin until the 2 men left for the farm meeting. That left 5 women. This had never happened before, nor since. They did note the \u0093burning skunk smell\u0094. The more unusual aspect of this (to me) was that when the men returned and they told them what happened, they said very little if anything. They didn\u0092t seem surprised or upset. They just loaded up some large caliber rifles and headed out into the night. They were gone until the wee hours, since the farm was 1000 acres or more. The sisters had no concept or knowledge of Sasquatch at the time.

            "Follow-Up Report": "Additional information:  Witness approached the 2 unknown figures riding in his car.  At first he was unsure of what he was seeing, but as the road began a slight downhill section, he got a better look.  This is when the headlights were raised enough to see the entire silhouette of both figures.  They were in his headlights for 6 - 8 seconds.  He was able to describe them as very heavy shouldered animals, running smoothly on two legs, at nearly 30 mph in his estimation.   He just had glanced at his speedometer and it read 40 mph.  In the 8 seconds of the sighting he was gaining on the pair but not overtaking them at any great speed.   Also stated both had pointed head shapes with little or no neck and bulky, thick shoulders which were covered in black hair.  The witness kept repeating how powerful and  tall the two animals were, estimating upwards of  9 feet in height.  Weight  between 500 - 800 pounds.  One was running near the centerline of the roadway, the other on the right hand shoulder portion of the road.    The one in the center of the road began to angle his run toward the right side where it ran along side the other for a few steps.  At this pont both veered off the road on a full run into the brushy treeline.  The witness did not stop his vehicle, but continued on home.This witness has had other documented sightings near this area as a full time forestry manager.  He spends an estimated 300 days a year in the woods.Earlier report by same witness:Report #7441",
