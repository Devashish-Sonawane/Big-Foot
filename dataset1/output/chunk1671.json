It just turned to its left, looking like it was slumped over, and it continued walked up the hill until it was out of sight.\"Sandy W. seen something walking on two, legs that wasn't a person or a bear.  I believe it could have been a Bigfoot creature.",

It was a rainy night but I am POSITIVE about what I saw! It was in the light! I still see it clearly in my mind! The calf sizes and leg size, the color, all the way up but didnt get the face. It was huge and it was dragging a dead dear or large goat behind it. I was very scared but at the same time wanted to stop and get out to take a look. I slowed down but couldnt stop. If it killed an animal I wasnt sure what it would do to me! I do believe in Bigfoot now.",

He was driving down the road about 10pm and thought he saw a very large man walking on the side of the road. As he got closer he saw the huge size. he moved over and slowed to take a look. They both looked at each other. My brother spead up and it started running next to the car. My brother said he was going about 45mph and it still kept up with him. My brother freaked out and floored it. He got on the cell phone and called my parents. He was crying all the way home (about 8 miles). When he got home he was crying for his Daddy and my Dad had to drag him from the car and into the house. My brother hid next to the fire place for the rest of the night. They called the police to go out and take a look. They found nothing. To this day he has a hard time talking about it. He is a all-state athelete and very smart. He would freak over nothing. This happened in July 2004.",
