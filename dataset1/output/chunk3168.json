Here is the link, where you can find some pictures of the area we hiked",

The URL posted in the report has a blog from June 14, 2009 with photos of the area during their hike. He mentioned that the kids were playing on the trail, \"just being kids,\" while this occurred. He related what occurred with additional details of the hike and descriptions of the sounds. He was adamant that it was not a cougar, elk, deer, bear, wolf or coyote. He said he had grown up knowing these sounds, and said it was a guttural \"whoo whoo  whoo\" sound to which another would reply. He said at one point it made all the hair on the back of his neck stand up, and that the sound was about 200 yards off the trail, or closer, and the return reply sounded to be about a mile off, and would get closer, and farther. He said the impressive thing that really stood out was that it was obivious they were communicating, and it fascinated him that they were having a conversation, if you will, while moving through the forest. Marys Peak is the highest part of the coastal mountain range and is very dense forest. Having lived near there as a child, I can attest that the area has thick forests all around.  ",
