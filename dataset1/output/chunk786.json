Rainier in the Wenatchee National Forest, of Washington State.

            "Follow-Up Report": "(Witness: CA resercher, Bart Cutino) I provided this report to several other investigators from both California and Washington who were present when this event  occurred.Although they didn't have an opportunity to witness the actual subject, they have reviewed the report and concur with all of the event descriptions as described by me from both the night it happened & the following day.On September 17, 2009, I went \"back\" for the first time to this sighting location with Ranger Robert Leiterman (CA-BFRO) to perform a daylight reconstruction & walk-through. That was when we were able to determine that I'd overestimated distance initially at 50 yds. The actual distance first observed was in fact 50 yds but the majority of the time I watched the subject was from a slight angle at 32-33 yds. Note that this does not deviate weight or height interpretation because it was compared and estimated to a physical person (researcher Paul) from where myself and the subject \"initially\" stood.

The next day we went out to the same location and noticed several trees had been broken and where blocking the road.  We examined the branchs and they were not cut, but physically broken.  They had to be at least 3-4 inches wide.  We didn't think anything of it, but we did get a wiff of a bad odor.  If I can find a map of the location, I can give you an exact location.",
