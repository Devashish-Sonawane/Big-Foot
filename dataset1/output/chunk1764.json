            "Follow-Up Report": "The witness was interviewed at the home, where the incident occurred. The first thing she noticed that early morning was how strange her cats were acting. Usually they are meowing out of control wanting to be fed the minute she gets up to make her coffee. They just sat there on the furniture quietly and didn't approach her like they normally do to be fed. This is when she glanced towards her dining room table and noticed something looking into the window. Whatever it was had large yellow eyes that were spread a good distance apart and wide enough across to block the view out to the barn's outside light. The area around the window was darker than the rest of the kitchen. The only light that was on was a small, overhead light above her that was about 10 feet from the dining room window. She cautiously backed up into the kitchen going into the front room and sitting down on a couch. While she backed up, she noticed the thing move from side to side. It appeared to look towards the front of the inside of her house. Once in the seated position, she sat quietly waiting for daylight, quite terrified to move. A rank smell was coming into the house through a front window that was somewhat left open. She was quite concerned about the window but was too afraid to walk over and close it. We asked her if she thought the eyes were reflecting light (eye shine) or giving off their own light (eye glow). She felt the eyes were reflecting the light from the overhead fixture in the kitchen. She was very scared and visibly upset during the interview.Once daylight came, her husband woke up and she told him what happened. When they went outside, they noticed the whole yard smelled awful. The area by the kitchen window was all matted down and crushed confirming that something was indeed standing outside her window. As a reference point, she marked the area on her kitchen window (see photo) with masking tape exactly where she could see the large eyes peering into the house. Their property has fruit bearing trees and a rather large vegetable garden. To the south is a large farm field with the Rocky River in the background. The north is comprised of thick woods and a good size creek that feeds the main river. The area consists of mixed hardwood forests, farm fields, and plenty of swamps. I would like to thank Randall Coyote and Dave Miller for their assistance in this investigation.The picture below shows a 6' 4\" Randall looking into the window. Judging by the height of the masking tape and the location of the yellow eyes, it was every bit of seven and a half to eight foot tall and wider than a human.The daughter lives in Canada and promised when she comes into town in the summer that she would talk to us about her experiences when she was younger, while growing up in this area. She didn't want to submit an additional report until we could go to a location with her, for better understanding of one particular incident. ",

At that time, there were large bushes growing on the east side of the pond. I travel that road a lot and it became habit to glance down at the pond to look for deer. On this particular morning, I saw what, without a doubt, was a large fur covered creature. He was squatting in front of the bushes at the edge of the pond and was using his right hand to drink...dipping into the water.",
